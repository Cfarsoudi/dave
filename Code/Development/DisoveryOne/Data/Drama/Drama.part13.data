        Setting: MADISON, PENNSYLVANIA 1972

        CLOSE UP OF VADA

                                 VADA
                        (to camera)
                I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet 
                seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. 
                And i've learned to live with this chicken 
                Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the 
                past three years, so I knew Dad would be 
                devastated when he learned of my latest 
                affliction.
                        (to Harry)
                Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left 
                breast is developing at a significantly faster 
                rate than my right. It can only mean one 
                thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.

                                 HARRY
                        (ignoring Vada)
                O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of 
                the fridge.

        FRONT OF SULTENFUSS' HOUSE

        Vada closes front door and goes down the steps to a group 
        of boys

                                 VADA
                All right, who's in raise your hand.

        All the boys raise their hands except Thomas J

                                 BOY
                Are you coming or not Thomas J?

                                 THOMAS J
                I don't think so.

                                 VADA
                I knew he wouldn't come.

                                 THOMAS J
                I can't, I have to go home.

                                 BOY#2
                Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.

                                 VADA
                Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.

        Group of boys enters house lead by Vada

        Once inside, the group is suddenly stopped

                                 VADA
                        (to boy#2)
                Hey, you didn't pay me!

                                 BOY#2
                How do I know you were gonna show us one?

                                 VADA
                You're such a baby.

                                 BOY#2
                All right, here.

        Boy reaches inside his pocket, gets money out and gives it 
        to Vada

                                 VADA
                All right, follow me and don't say a word.

        They walk towards two large doors, stop, and Vada turns 
        around

                You ready?

        They enter the coffin display room, and move over to the 
        coffin in the middle of the room

                You sure you wanna see it, or is someone 
                gonna go yellow belly?

                                 BOY#3
                I'm not chicken!

                                 VADA
                Okay. Lean forward.

        A tense moment as the coffin lid is flung open by Vada and 
        the boys gasp as they look inside

                                 GIRL#1
                It's empty!

                                 BOY#2
                You're so weird!

                                 BOY
                I want my money back!

                                 VADA
                I was afraid of this.

        They begin to move into another part of the house

                                 BOY#2
                Of what??

                                 VADA
                Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not 
                completely dead, you know, like when they cut 
                a chickens head off and it still runs around 
                crazy.

                                 BOY#3
                You're full of shit.

                                 VADA
                I bet she's roaming around this house 
                somewhere.

        They open the door into the living room, where Grammoo is 
        in her rocking chair

                There she is, in the rocking chair.

        Pause, then Grammoo begins to rock the chair gently. The 
        boys all gasp and then all exit very quickly

                                 VADA
                Hi Grammoo.

        Vada seats herself upon Grammoo's lap

                                 HARRY
                        (in distance, from 
                        downstairs)
                Vada would you bring down my cigarettes?

        Vada gets up and begins to leave

                                 VADA
                Seeya later.
                        (kisses Grammoo on forehead)

        BASEMENT, HARRY & ARTHUR WORKING ON MR. LAYTON

                                 HARRY
                Did I tell you, he was my woodshop teacher.

                                 ARTHUR
                You took woodshop?

                                 HARRY
                Yeah, I made a tie rack.

                                 ARTHUR
                I made a tie rack.

        Vada comes down the stairs and stops just before the corner 
        that would allow her to see the corpse of Mr. Layton

                                 VADA
                Ahem.

                                 HARRY
                Vada, just put 'em on the stool.

        Vada places the packet on a stool

                                 VADA
                Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly 
                yesterday.

                                 HARRY
                        (completely ignoring Vada's 
                        comment)
                Ya, that rack holds six ties.

                                 ARTHUR
                I still have mine.

        Vada recognizes Arthur's voice

                                 VADA
                Arthur!!

                                 ARTHUR
                Vada!!

                                 VADA
                I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.

                                 ARTHUR
                Good for you baby.

                                 VADA
                Once you put the hotels on board walk and 
                Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.

                                 ARTHUR
                I like to buy off all the railroads.

        Harry is slightly annoyed at Vada distracting them

                                 HARRY
                Vada, we're trying to work here.

                was gonna make a fur out of 'em!

                                 HARRY
                        (to Arthur)

        Vada begins to sing doo-wah-diddy-diddy, Arthur joins in

                                 HARRY
                        (annoyed)
                VADA!

                                 VADA
                Dad?

                                 HARRY
                I'm embalming my high school teacher, don't 
                sing.
                        (beat)
                All right Arthur, just a slide of the 
                needle.....
                        (fades out as Vada climbs 
                        stairs)

        Vada climbs stairs and stops to read patient note, CAUSE OF 
        DEATH - CANCER OF PROSTATE

                                 HARRY
                        (to corpse)

        OUTSIDE SULTENFUSS' HOUSE DAY, STRANGE WOMAN GETS OUT OF 
        CAMPER, WALKS UP TO DOOR AND RINGS BELL, VADA ANSWERS

                                 STRANGER
                Is Mr. Harry Sultenfuss in?

                                 VADA
                Sure, come on in.

        Vada and strange woman make their way to a desk in the 
        foyer, and sit down

                So, have you had the unfortunate experience 
                of recently losing a loved one?

                                 STRANGER
                        (puzzled look)
                Could I see your Dad, just for a second?

        Vada runs across to call downstairs

                                 VADA
                DAD, SOMEBODY'S HERE!!

        Vada runs back to the desk

                He's downstairs working on Mr. Layton. 
                Prostate Cancer. Once it hits your prostate, 
                you're a goner.

                                 STRANGER
                Oh.

        Harry enters

                                 HARRY
                How may I... Help you?

                                 STRANGER
                I'm Shelly devoto. We spoke, the other day 
                regarding the make up artist job.

                                 HARRY
                Oh yes.

                                 SHELLY
                It's still available I hope?

                                 HARRY
                I think it's still available.

                                 SHELLY
                I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for 
                two years, at the "Dino Raphael" Salon, all my 
                customers cried when I told them I was 
                leaving.

                                 HARRY
                Uhh, Miss devoto...

                                 SHELLY
                I have a wonderful disposition, I put people 
                right at ease.

                                 HARRY
                Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at 
                ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a 
                Funeral Parlor.

                                 SHELLY
                They're dead?

                                 HARRY
                Yes they are.

                                 SHELLY
                Stiffs??

                                 HARRY
                        (for want of a better word)
                Deceased.

                                 SHELLY
                The add just said "Makeup Artist"

        Doorbell rings

                                 HARRY
                Ahh, excuse me a second will you?
                        (opens door)
                Hi George, this is a twelve-fifty-eight, I 
                didn't want the burnished handles.
                        (door closes off scene)

        Vada looks out the window at Shelly's camper

                                 VADA
                Is that your camper?

                                 SHELLY
                Yes it is.

                                 VADA
                That's really cool.

        Grammoo walks past in a fixed stare

                                 SHELLY
                        (to Grammoo)
                Hello.

        Grammoo keeps walking as if she hadn't heard

                                 VADA
                She's shy.

                                 SHELLY
                Oh.

        Harry is standing at the door directing the men with the 
        coffin

                                 HARRY
                Just put it back in the display room fellers.

                                 MEN
                Okay Harry.

        The men move off, Vada walks over to Harry

                                 VADA
                Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?

                                 HARRY
                They come in all sizes honey, just like 
                shoes.

                                 VADA
                Is it for a child?

        Harry hesitates

                                 HARRY
                Of course not.

                                 VADA
                Then who's it for?

        Small pause while Harry thinks of a reply

                                 HARRY
                Short people, very short people.

        Shelly walks over to Harry

                                 SHELLY
                Excuse me, what about the job?

                                 HARRY
                Pardon?

                                 SHELLY
                I need the job.

                                 HARRY
                Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...

                                 SHELLY
                Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my 
                former clients will eventually die, and all 
                your clients used to be alive, so they have 
                something in common.

                                 HARRY
                You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering 
                the phone.

                                 SHELLY
                Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.

                                 HARRY
                Great, you can start right away. Call me 
                Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally 
                wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, 
                very much, but the....

                                 SHELLY
                I promise i'll take good care of these 
                people, they deserve it, they're dead, all 
                they've got left is their looks.

        Harry and Vada exchange weird looks

        OUTSIDE SHOPPING MALL-AREA DAY

        Vada and Thomas J are riding their bikes through town

                                 THOMAS J
                Hey look at this, no feet!

                                 VADA
                Oh wow, a real evil canieval.

        Vada and Thomas J ride up through a garage

                                 PSYCHO MECHANIC
                WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING IN MY GARAGE, GET 
                OUTTA HERE!!!

        Vada and Thomas J arrive outside the entrance to the 
        Doctors surgery, Vada enters and climbs stairs, she passes a 
        small boy in a wheelchair in the corridor, Vada enters room

        INSIDE DOCTOR WELTY'S WAITING ROOM

                                 NURSE RANDALL
                Hi Vada, what's wrong today?

                                 VADA
                I'm very sick.

                                 NURSE RANDALL
                Okay, take a seat, i'll check if the doctor 
                can see you.

        She picks up phone and whispers something inaudible to the 
        doctor

                                 NURSE RANDALL
                Okay, he'll see you, why don't you go in?

        Vada opens door to doctors surgery and enters

        OVER DR WELTY'S SHOULDER, CLOSE UP OF VADA HAVING HER EAR 
        EXAMINED

                                 VADA
                Well, what is it? I can handle it.

                                 DR WELTY
                You are perfectly healthy.

                                 VADA
                That can't be, I have all the classic 
                symptoms.

                                 DR WELTY
                Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your 
                house today?

                                 VADA
                Yes.

                                 DR WELTY
                Vada you've gotta stop this, there's 
                absolutely nothing wrong with you!

        Vada gets up in a mood, puts hat on, and walks to the door, 
        stopping and says with condescending intonation...

                                 VADA
                I'll just have to get a second opinion.

        OUTSIDE DOCTORS SURGERY DAY

        Vada emerges from the building and gets on her bike

                                 THOMAS J
                So, what'd he say was wrong with you?

        Vada is turning and beginning to ride away

                                 VADA
                The whole medical profession is a crack.

        Thomas J is trying to catch up

                                 THOMAS J
                Hey wait up for me!

        BIKE RIDE DOWN MAIN STREET IN TOWN

        VADA & THOMAS J ARE SINGING

        Vada slows down, stops and looks at a person on a ladder 
        painting a house

                                 VADA
                Hey look!

        Thomas J stops also

                                 THOMAS J
                At what?

                                 VADA
                That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.

                                 THOMAS J
                I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!

                                 VADA
                Hi Mr. Bixler!

        Mr. Bixler turns around and sees Vada and Thomas J

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. 
                J! How's the summer treating you?

                                 VADA
                It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the 
                books for summer reading.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Really? Already? The summer's just begun.

                                 VADA
                Yes, and now I'm reading War & Peace for fun.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                No wonder you're my prize pupil. What about 
                you Thomas J?

                                 THOMAS J
                I haven't started yet.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Better get on his case Vada.

        Mr. Bixler gets down off his ladder

                                 VADA
                Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old 
                house?

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.

                                 VADA
                This is one big house for one single person.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Well, you never can tell...
                        (Vada gets worried look on 
                        her face)
                I might get a pet.
                        (Vada's expression relaxes, 
                        she smiles)

                                 VADA
                How are you gonna get the money for this old 
                house if you're not working?

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this 
                summer, so, I'm doing some work.

                                 VADA
                How much does it cost?

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Thirty five dollars.

                                 VADA
                What do you get for that?

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. 
                This an interrogation Vada?

                                 VADA
                No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off 
                War & Peace.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                It's summer! You're kids! Go play!

        Vada and Thomas J ride off down street

        SIDE ON SHOT OF VADA AND THOMAS J RIDING DOWN STREET, 
        CAMERA IS MOVING WITH THEM

                                 THOMAS J
                Wanna go to Gray's orchard and pick some 
                peaches?

                                 VADA
                No, I'm going home.

                                 THOMAS J
                Why? It's not dinner time yet.

                                 VADA
                Dinner time?? You're like a dog! You just go 
                home to eat.

        Vada accelerates leaving Thomas J in her tracks

                Don't pee on the hydrant!!

        VADA'S BEDROOM

        Vada puts a record on to play.
                        (song is "Wedding Bell 
                        Blues")
        She then opens a drawer and picks up a class photograph, 
        with Mr. Bixler enhaloed in a heart shape. Music begins to 
        play and Vada sings along the first few bars whilst looking 
        at the photo longingly

        SULTENFUSS' DINING ROOM TABLE NIGHT, VADA IS LYING ON THE 
        FLOOR SPRAWLED OUT, HARRY AND PHIL ARE HAVING A 
        CONVERSATION, AND GRAMMOO IS SITTING STARING INTO SPACE, 
        SHELLY ENTERS

                                 SHELLY
                Excuse me Harry, I finished Mr. Layton's 
                hair. He kinda looked......
                        (she sees Vada lying down 
                        sprawled out on the floor)
                Harry, what's wrong with her??

                                 HARRY
                Oh, she's just pretending. Vada, get up here 
                and eat your broccoli!

        Shelly moves over and crouches down next to Vada

                                 VADA
                        (very sick sounding voice)
                I think it's my prostate.

        All of a sudden, Grammoo begins to sing

                                 GRAMMOO
                I got rhythm, I got music, I got my man who 
                could ask for anything more? I got daisies, in 
                green pastures, I got my man, who could ask 
                for anything more?

        As this is being sung, Shelly slowly looks up with a VERY 
        weird expression, this is too much for her

        OUTSIDE FRONT OF HOUSE, VADA AND THOMAS J SITTING ON STEPS 
        DAY

        Shelly exits house and closes door behind her, and then 
        crouches down beside Vada and Thomas J

                                 SHELLY
                Who's winning?

                                 VADA
                I am.

        As Vada and Thomas J continue to play, three Vada-aged 
        girls come up to the end of the Sultenfuss' driveway

                                 GIRL#1
                Look, there's Vada and her little BOYFRIEND
                        (very mocking voice)

                                 VADA
                He is not my boyfriend!

                                 GIRL#2
                I bet she kissed him on the lips!

                                 VADA
                Do you think I kissed that ugly old thing?

                                 THOMAS J
                Yeah anyway.

                                 GIRL#2
                Come on let's go.

                                 GIRL#1 & GIRL#2
                Judy's father owns the movie theater and we 
                get to see all the movies WE want for free.

                                 JUDY
                Maybe you can come some time.

                                 GUY#2
                Eeeuww, don't invite HER, she'll have to 
                bring her boyfriend.

        The two girls begin to walk off, Judy follows slowly 
        looking guilty and embarrassed by her friends

                                 GIRL#2
                        (together)
                Vada and Thomas, sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-
                I-N-G, first comes love, then comes marriage, 
                then comes Thomas J in a baby carriage.

        Judy wanders off screen, looking sorry for Vada

                                 SHELLY
                You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls 
                upset you.

                                 VADA
                I'm not upset. I will never play with those 
                girls. I only surround myself with people who 
                I find intellectually stimulating.

        Thomas J looks at Shelly and smiles, he is proud to be the 
        friend of such an intelligent girl

                                 SHELLY
                        (to Vada)
                Want a piece of chocolate?

        Vada shakes her head

                                 SHELLY
                Thomas J?

                                 THOMAS J
                I'm allergic to it.

                                 SHELLY
                To chocolate?

                                 VADA
                He's allergic to everything.

                                 SHELLY
                Chocolate?

                                 VADA & THOMAS J
                TO EVERYTHING.

        Shelly notices a ring that Vada is wearing on her right 
        index finger

                                 SHELLY
                Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.

                                 VADA
                It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.

                                 THOMAS J
                It doesn't work, it always stays black.
                        (NOTE ring is BLACK)

                                 VADA
                It's only black when you're around 'cause you 
                put me in a bad mood.

                                 SHELLY
                Maybe black means you're happy?

                                 VADA
                I don't think so.
                        (pause)
                Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars?

                                 THOMAS J
                She's crazy, she wants to go to school over 
                the summer.

                                 VADA
                It's not a real school, it's a writing class, 
                I wanna be a writer.

                                 THOMAS J
                She only wants to do it because her sweetie 
                pie's the teacher.

        Vada is annoyed that Shelly now knows her little secret and 
        pushes Thomas J

                                 VADA
                Shut your big fat mouth!

                                 SHELLY
                I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask 
                your Dad?

                                 VADA
                He won't give it to me.

                                 SHELLY
                Well you don't know that. Ask him.

        SULTENFUSS' LIVING ROOM, GRAMMOO AND HARRY WATCHING TV, 
        VADA ENTERS

        Vada passes Grammoo and Harry who are watching a TV show, 
        she then seats herself next to Harry

                                 VADA
                Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?

                                 HARRY
                That's a lot of money for a little girl.

                                 VADA
                It's for school, for summer writing class.

                                 HARRY
                        (engrossed with TV show)
                Any more soda left?

        Vada pours Harry another soda

                                 VADA
                Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.

                                 HARRY
                Last month you wanted to play the violin. 
                Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.

        Harry keeps his gaze fixed the entire time upon the TV 
        screen

                                 VADA
                Dad?

                                 HARRY
                        (referring to TV)
                I love this guy!
                        (he laughs)

                                 VADA
                Dad??

                                 HARRY
                What?

                                 VADA
                The money?

                                 HARRY
                Ahh, maybe next summer.

                                 VADA'S THOUGHTS
                He forgot about the time I wanted to be a 
                magician, I was really great at making myself 
                disappear.

        FOYER OF SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, VADA BOUNCING BASKET-BALL, 
        ARTHUR ENTERS

                                 VADA
                Wanna play?

                                 ARTHUR
                No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your 
                head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me.

        Arthur grabs ball and begins to dribble it properly as a 
        demonstration

                See. You were looking at the ball. All right? 
                Keep your head up. Gimme some skin,

        They both give each other five i.e. Slap each others hands, 
        Arthur exits. Vada continues bouncing the ball, which 
        accidentally veers off and goes down the stairs into the 
        basement

        SCARY MUSIC

        Vada goes very slowly down the stairs, and peeks round the 
        corner, she is clearly very scared of the basement and the 
        corpses contained in it, she then rushes down and grabs the 
        ball. As she turns around, Shelly, who is upstairs walking 
        through the house and sees the door ajar, slams it shut 
        unaware that Vada is down there. Vada runs up the stairs and 
        tries to open the door, she can't, drops the ball and starts 
        to yell out for help and bang on the it. Shelly hears the 
        noise and comes to the door. Vada, overcome with fear, sits 
        on a step, covers her ears and begins to sing doo-wah-diddy-
        diddy. Shelly yanks the door open and sees Vada crouched on 
        the step

                                 SHELLY
                Vada? VADA?? What happened??

                                 VADA
                        (extremely frightened and 
                        timid)
                My ball, I lost my ball.

                                 SHELLY
                        (picking Vada up onto her 
                        feet)
                Come on sweetie.

        The two exit the scene

        SHELLY PUTTING MAKEUP ON DEAD LADY, BASEMENT OF SULTENFUSS' 
        HOUSE

                                 SHELLY
                Excuse me Harry?

                                 HARRY
                Uh huh?

                                 SHELLY
                Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?

                                 HARRY
                Yeah.

        Harry gets up from his desk, moves over to Mrs. Porter and 
        observes Shelly's work, he looks unimpressed

                Didn't I give you a picture of what she 
                looked like?

                                 SHELLY
                Yeah,
                        (searches pockets, eventually 
                        pulling out a photo)

        Harry compares photo with Mrs. Porter's face

                                 SHELLY
                You don't like it?

                                 HARRY
                This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have 
                her looking like a two dollar hooker.

                                 SHELLY
                        (a little offended)
                I think she looks nice! Her lips are very 
                thin so I used the gloss to give them a more 
                sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a 
                little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, 
                nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.

                                 HARRY
                She did. This photo was taken a month ago at 
                the church food drive.

                                 SHELLY
                I just wanted to get past this "old school 
                Marm" image.

                                 HARRY
                That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school 
                Marm.
                        (beat)
                Fix it.

        Harry begins to leave

                                 SHELLY
                Harry?
                        (Harry stops and turns 
                        around)
                I was just wondering, if there is anything 
                wrong with Vada.

                                 HARRY
                What do you mean??

                                 SHELLY
                Well the other night at dinner...

                                 HARRY
                Oh that, she just likes to play.

                                 SHELLY
                I don't think so, I think she's confused 
                about death.

                                 HARRY
                She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a 
                thing or two about it.

                                 SHELLY
                Harry, I really think she.....

                                 HARRY
                        (annoyed)
                She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, 
                look, don't give me any advice about my 
                daughter, okay?

        OUTSIDE FRONT OF HOUSE, VADA AND THOMAS J ARE TURNING A 
        SKIPPING ROPE AND PHIL IS JUMPING IN IT PUFFING AWAY, VADA & 
        THOMAS J ARE SAYING A RHYME THAT GOES WITH SKIPPING GAMES, 
        SHELLY PULLS UP IN HER CAMPER

                                 VADA
                There's Shelly!

        Vada and Thomas J stop turning the rope leaving Phil 
        standing there exhausted, and run over to Shelly's camper, 
        Shelly gets out

                                 SHELLY
                Hi.

                                 VADA
                Can we look around in your camper?

                                 SHELLY
                Sure. I'll give you the royal tour.

        Vada and Thomas J rush inside the camper

                        (surprised at Vada and Thomas 
                        J's eagerness to get inside)
                Woah! Gosh!

        Thomas J seats himself at the drivers seat and makes "vroom 
        vroom" noises, Vada sits at the table, selects a book from a 
        small bookshelf on the side, and begins to read it

                                 THOMAS J
                Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you 
                really eat and sleep here?

                                 SHELLY
                Uh huh.

                                 THOMAS J
                I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.

                                 SHELLY
                Liverpool?

                                 VADA
                Big Ringo fan.

                                 SHELLY
                Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?

                                 VADA
                I would.

                                 SHELLY
                Thomas?

                                 THOMAS J
                Yes please.

        Thomas uproots himself and sits opposite Vada at the table

                                 THOMAS J
                What are you reading?

        Vada makes a gesture at Thomas J with her finger up to her 
        lips implying that he should be quiet

        Shelly notices Vada reading the book

                                 SHELLY
                Oh! You shouldn't be looking at that, it's a 
                little too old for you.

        She takes the book away from her

                                 VADA
                Did you read ALL these books?

                                 SHELLY
                Uh huh.

                                 VADA
                What are they about?

                                 SHELLY
                Mostly love, and romance.

                                 THOMAS J
                Eeeeuuuww, gross.

                                 SHELLY
                They're just fun to read.

        Shelly hands the soda around

                Here, cheers.

        Everybody takes a mouthful of drink

                                 VADA
                Are you married?

                                 SHELLY
                No, I'm divorced.

                                 VADA
                Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.

                                 SHELLY
                Well, sometimes married people just find out 
                they can't live with each other.

                                 THOMAS J
                Mine aren't divorced.

        Thomas J gets up and reaches for the cookie jar

                Shelly, can I have a cookie?

                                 SHELLY
        With bottle of soda in mouth
                Hmmmph gurgle gurgle...

        Thomas pulls out a few bank notes of largish denomination

                                 THOMAS J
                Hey, where are all the cookies??

        Vada sees the money and the expression on her face shows 
        she has an idea

                                 SHELLY
                Well, I guess you found my secret hiding 
                place.

                                 THOMAS J
                What are you saving for?

                                 SHELLY
                Nothing in particular, just putting it away 
                for a rainy day.

        Cuckoo clock goes "Cuckoo." Lunch time, 12 o'clock

                                 THOMAS J
                I'm supposed to be home at noon for lunch, 
                thanks Shelly.

        Thomas J leaves

                                 SHELLY
                Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head 
                back?

                                 VADA
                Can I use your bathroom first?

                                 SHELLY
                Sure.

                                 VADA
                You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if 
                you're late.

                                 SHELLY
                Okay.

        Shelly exits and Vada enters toilet with a VERY guilty look 
        on her face

        SUMMER WRITING CLASS, FOCUS ON MR. BIXLER

                                 MR. BIXLER
                The great way, is not difficult for those 
                with no preferences, with the absence of both 
                love and hate, everything becomes clear and 
                undisguised. That was written by a Chinese 
                Philosopher in the year 600. Now why would I 
                choose to bring that up in a creative writing 
                class? Because, the absence of judgment helps 
                us to appreciate reality. In other words, I 
                want you to listen to your classmates writing, 
                with a clear and open heart, okay? So who's 
                gonna go first?

                                 GUY
                I got one.

        He gets up

                I sang a song for you to hear, I painted a 
                picture for you to see, I picked a rose for 
                you to smell, I planted grass for you to 
                touch, But you did not hear my song, You did 
                not see my picture, You did not smell my rose 
                and YOU did not touch my grass.

                Woman
                Maybe she was outta town?

                                 GUY#2
                That's not funny, his poem is about futility, 
                we toil in unrewarded obscurity.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Now, I hear judgment, let's not forget the 
                part about the open heart...

        The door at the back of the room opens and Vada enters 
        holding a writing pad and pen looking nervous

                Vada, is there, something I can do for you?

                                 VADA
                        (very nervous)
                I paid the money.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                For this class?

                                 VADA
                Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Vada, this is an adult writing class.

                                 JUSTIN
                Hey, I think it's real beautiful. She want's 
                to be a writer.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Vada, you sure you wanna do this?

        Vada nods her head

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Welcome to the class, go find a seat.

        The class applauds

                Okay ahh, who's next?

                                 RONDA
                I experienced something with my boyfriend the 
                other day, and I wrote a few words down.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                The floor's yours Ronda.

                                 RONDA
                He covers me like a blanket, from the cold, 
                dark night, As I look into his eyes, I know 
                it's right, To touch, To feel, I know he's 
                real, Flesh all a mush, Flesh ALL a mush, I 
                can't fight it, There's no point, I wake up in 
                Lighter joint.

        Several looks glance around the room. Vada raises her hand

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.

                                 VADA
                I wrote a poem too.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Please.

                                 VADA
                Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss
                I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good 
                when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, 
                This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate 
                or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode.

                That's all I got so far.

                                 JUSTIN
                I hear that Vada, Flesh all a Mush or Rocky 
                Road, it's about desire.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Vada that's... It's very sweet, and it rhymes 
                and that's also good  but, you're not 
                expressing to me what's in your soul. I want 
                you to show me how you see the world, your 
                fears, your desires, your innermost secrets.

                                 VADA'S THOUGHTS
                My fears and secrets. I'm afraid I killed my 
                mother.

        OUTSIDE SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, THEN INSIDE ON SHELLY AT DESK, 
        TUBA IS BEING PLAYED IN THE BACKGROUND

        Shelly gets up smiling when she hears the music and 
        proceeds to the living room

        Shelly pokes her head in the door to see Harry playing a 
        tune to Grammoo on his tuba

                                 HARRY
                        (sung, to Grammoo)
                Can not do without, Harry's wild about me.

                                 SHELLY
                Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let 
                you know that the flowers were delivered. And 
                the room's all set up.

                                 HARRY
                Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the 
                other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a 
                little harsh.

                                 SHELLY
                I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's 
                business. It's just that I like Vada, very 
                much.

                                 HARRY
                After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to 
                help take care of Vada. They were very close, 
                but lately as her mind's been wandering more 
                and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm 
                sure she'll snap out of it though.

                                 SHELLY
                I'm sure she will.

        VADA AND THOMAS J AT THEIR FAVORITE SPOT, EDGE OF LAKE WITH 
        VERY LARGE BEAUTIFUL WEEPING WILLOW JUST UP THE BANK A 
        LITTLE FROM A SMALL PIER WHERE TWO FISHING POLES ARE SET UP, 
        ONE HELD BY VADA AND THE OTHER BY A HOLDER AS THOMAS J HANGS 
        UPSIDE DOWN FROM THE TREE

                                 THOMAS J
                Nothing's biting today.

                                 VADA
                Maybe they had a big breakfast.

                                 THOMAS J
                        (hanging from tree)
                I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.

                                 VADA
                Big deal, I can do that too.
                        (Thomas J's reel begins to 
                        click)
                Thomas J, you got something!

                                 THOMAS J
                Oh no!
                        (he jumps down from the tree)
                UUH.

                                 VADA
                Hurry!

                                 THOMAS J
                I'm trying.

                                 VADA
                Reel it in.
                        (Thomas J reels the fish in)
                He's only tiny, throw him back.

                                 THOMAS J
                I don't like touching fish, how do you pull 
                the hook out without touching it?

        Thomas J puts his foot on the fish and pulls

                                 VADA
                You're hurting him, don't kill him!!

        The hook is out of the fish's mouth and sitting on the pier

        Vada then removes the hook from the fish's mouth {minor 
        error in film} and in the process pricks herself

                                 VADA
                Ouch! Darn hook!

        Vada puts the fish back

                                 VADA
                I'm bleeding, did he get away? Go look.

        Thomas J looks and sees the fish, dead, floating on top of 
        the water

                                 THOMAS J
                Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.

                                 VADA
                Hey, we can become blood brothers.

                                 THOMAS J
                Naah, I don't wanna.

                                 VADA
                You could pick that scab on your arm.

                                 THOMAS J
                It's a mosquito bite.

                                 VADA
                It'll bleed.

                                 THOMAS J
                If I do it, can we go?

                                 VADA
                Uh huh.

                                 THOMAS J
                Okay, OW!

        Thomas J picks the scab on his arm which begins to bleed

                                 VADA
                Okay, rub them together.

        They rub their cuts together

                                 VADA
                Now we're blood brothers for life.

        HARRY IS TYPING UP A DEATH NOTICE IN HIS STUDY, SHELLY 
        ENTERS

                                 SHELLY
                Hi.

                                 HARRY
                Oh Hi, what can I do for you?

                                 SHELLY
                Nothing, I was just wondering what you were 
                doing.

                                 HARRY
                Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you 
                know when someone dies people want it in the 
                paper usually, it's a service we provide for 
                the family.

                                 SHELLY
                Oh right, right,
                        (she picks up the newspaper). 
                Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 
                1972 Devoted husband to 
                Nicolette. Cherished father of 
                Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu 
                of flowers, please send 
                donations to the holy names 
                society.

                                 HARRY
                I wrote that.

                                 SHELLY
                No kidding?

        Harry gives Shelly a matter-of-fact look

                                 SHELLY
                Oh it's good, "In lieu of" I love that word 
                lieu.

                                 HARRY
                I prefer it to "instead", it has more 
                dignity.

                                 SHELLY
                In lieu... "instead".... No contest.

                                 HARRY
                It's no big deal.

                                 SHELLY
                You have to learn how to take a complement.
                        (Shelly turns the newspaper 
                        over)
                Movies, movies, ahhhh, "Love Story" at the 
                drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?

                                 HARRY
                I haven't been to the movies in AGES.

                                 SHELLY
                I love going to movies, especially at the 
                drive in. I don't think there's anything more 
                romantic than going to the drive in.
                        (subtle HINT)
                I'll let you get back to work.

        Shelly begins to exit with a look of failure on her face

                                 HARRY
                I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to 
                join me for a game tomorrow night at church 
                you're welcome to.

                                 SHELLY
                        (considers for a moment)
                Okay.

        Harry resumes typing

        VADA IS RUNNING THROUGH FOYER AND BEGINS TO PASS BATHROOM 
        WHERE SHELLY IS PUTTING ON MAKEUP

                                 SHELLY
                Hi Vada.

                                 VADA
                Are you going out somewhere?

                                 SHELLY
                No.

                                 VADA
                So how come you're putting lipstick on?

                                 SHELLY
                A girl's always gotta look her best.

                                 VADA
                I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are 
                that color.

                                 SHELLY
                Have you ever tried any?

                                 VADA
                No.

                                 SHELLY
                Come here, sit down.

        Vada enters bathroom and sits down on the closed toilet 
        seat, Shelly brings up a stool and sits down in front of 
        Vada. Vada gets some lipstick put on her

                                 SHELLY
                Now, first we blot.

        Vada blots her lips on some tissue

                                 SHELLY
                Take a look. I think it looks real nice on 
                you.

        Vada looks in Shelly's mirror

                                 VADA
                Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?

                                 SHELLY
                Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've 
                got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest 
                little nose, an amazing mouth.

                                 VADA
                The boys at school don't think I am.

                                 SHELLY
                They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna 
                bring out the gorgeous color in them. The 
                first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can 
                never wear enough blue eye shadow.

                                 VADA
                Do you like putting makeup on people?

                                 SHELLY
                Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to 
                Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the 
                stars, I haven't gotten there yet.
                        (she finishes her work)
                All right, open your eyes.

        Vada opens her eyes and looks in the mirror

                                 VADA
                Shelly, I would definitely hold off on that 
                Hollywood thing.

        VADA EXITS HOUSE THROUGH FRONT DOOR, RAUNCHY MUSIC IS 
        PLAYING AND SHE DOES A GROOVY WALK TO THE STEPS WHERE THOMAS 
        J AWAITS HER, SHE LIES DOWN LENGTH WAYS ACROSS THE STEP AND 
        LOOKS AT HIM

                                 THOMAS J
                Your lip bleeding?

                                 VADA
                No.

                                 THOMAS J
                What's wrong with your eyes?

                                 VADA
                A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.

                                 THOMAS J
                Where's your bike?

                                 VADA
                Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.

        The two enter the garage, where a large black hearse is 
        parked

                                 VADA
                It's only a garage, come on.

        Vada notices that one of her streamers on her bike is gone

                                 VADA
                Hey, one of my streamers is gone! It probably 
                fell off in here.

        Thomas J walks over to a model of a head

                                 THOMAS J
                Hey look at this!

                                 VADA
                That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, 
                they used to study the bumps in your head to 
                see if you had a good personality or not. Come 
                here, i'll diagnose your head.

                                 THOMAS J
                No, I don't wanna.

                                 VADA
                Come on, it's fun.

        Vada examines Thomas J's head and then compares it with the 
        chart

                                 VADA
                Hmmmm, interesting.

                                 THOMAS J
                What?

                                 VADA
                You have no personality.

                                 THOMAS J
                Hey, where does it say that?

                                 VADA
                Never mind.

        Thomas J knocks the lid off a small box and reveals a photo

                                 THOMAS J
                Is that your Dad?

                                 VADA
                Yes.

                                 THOMAS J
                Who's that with your Dad?

                                 VADA
                It's my mother.

                                 THOMAS J
                Do you remember her?

                                 VADA
                No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.

                                 THOMAS J
                What do you think it's like?

                                 VADA
                What?

                                 THOMAS J
                Heaven.

                                 VADA
                I think, everybody gets their own white 
                horse, and all they do is ride and eat 
                marshmallows all day, and everybody's best 
                friends with everybody else, when you play 
                sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets 
                picked last.

                                 THOMAS J
                But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?

                                 VADA
                It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular 
                horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal 
                if you fall, you just land in cloud.

                                 THOMAS J
                That doesn't sound so bad, come on, we'll 
                never find that streamer.

        As they leave, Vada turns back and grabs the photo, then 
        returns to Thomas J

        HARRY'S BEDROOM, HARRY IS DRESSING AND GETTING READY FOR 
        HIS DATE WITH SHELLY

        The tune "Moonglow" is playing on the radio

                                 PHIL
                Well well well, what's going on in here?

                                 HARRY
                Nothing, I'm dressing.

                                 PHIL
                Oh, you're dressing, uh huh, Harry Harry 
                Harry Harry, don't you know it's not nice to 
                lie to your big brother?

        Phil then proceeds to give Harry a noogie

                                 HARRY
                HEY! WATCH THE HAIR!! THIS SHIRT GIVES!!! ALL 
                RIGHT!!!!

        Phil stops

                I'm going out with Shelly.

                                 PHIL
                Oh yes, oh that's great.

                                 HARRY
                I'm very nervous.

                                 PHIL
                Why?

                                 HARRY
                The last date I had was twenty years ago.

                                 PHIL
                That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me 
                fill you in on today's women, since the last 
                time you dated, something happened, "The 
                Sexual Revolution", now before that, you used 
                to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull 
                her chair out, pick up the check, no more no 
                more, you wanna know what else is missing? 
                BRAS!

                                 HARRY
                Oh come on.

                                 PHIL
                Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this 
                woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her 
                like every Tom Dick and Harry.

                                 HARRY
                Are you sure about all this?

                                 PHIL
                Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?

                                 HARRY
                Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any 
                minute.

                                 PHIL
                Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the 
                right track.

                                 HARRY
                No, she's just driving over here, then we're 
                taking my car. How do I look?

                                 PHIL
                Like a Sultenfuss. Go get 'em.

        Harry runs down the stairs and passes Vada on the way

                                 HARRY
                Goodnight Vada.

                                 VADA
                Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?

                                 HARRY
                Ahh, I just wanna look nice.

                                 VADA
                You never cared before.

                                 HARRY
                Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go 
                together.

                                 VADA
                Why?

                                 HARRY
                She likes to play bingo.

                                 VADA
                Can I go too?

                                 HARRY
                Naah, I think you'd better stay here and keep 
                Grammoo company.

        Harry leaves and then Vada makes a decision, she goes out 
        the door

        OUTSIDE THE SENNET'S HOUSE, VADA IS CREEPING ALONG NIGHT

        Vada approaches the Sennet's house and signals through the 
        window for Thomas J to come outside, which he does

                                 THOMAS J
                Vada? Vada?? Where are you??

        Vada springs up from her hiding place

                                 VADA
                Here.

                                 THOMAS J
                Don't DO that!!

                                 VADA
                Sorry.

                                 THOMAS J
                What do you want? My mom will skin me alive 
                if she finds I'm out here.

                                 VADA
                Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo 
                tonight.

                                 THOMAS J
                I told you i'll get in trouble.

                                 VADA
                Pacifist!

                                 THOMAS J
                I am not.

                                 VADA
                Bed wetter!

                                 THOMAS J
                I stopped that!

        AT THE CHURCH, FOCUS ON THE BINGO ANNOUNCER WHO IS CALLING 
        OUT THE NUMBERS

                                 HARRY
                Don't worry, there's a strategy to bingo. For 
                instance, on a given night anybody can win, 
                but I play the odds, when choosing bingo 
                cards, I use a range of theories from the laws 
                of probability to avoiding duplicate number 
                systems. This way you get much more activity.

                                 SHELLY
                        (hopeful)
                Does it make it easier to win?

                                 HARRY
                No. Just, more activity.

        Harry then pulls a seat out and sits down in it, cutting 
        Shelly off, who has to pull her own seat out and sit down

                                 HARRY
                        (as he sits down, to the 
                        person next to him)
                Hi Carl.

        OUTSIDE THE CHURCH NIGHT

        Vada and Thomas J are walking up to the church

                                 THOMAS J
                They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.

                                 VADA
                We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.

                                 THOMAS J
                Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.

                                 VADA
                Duck!

        Vada and Thomas J are ducking behind a counter on one side 
        of the church, Harry and Shelly are quite clearly visible on 
        the other side of the room

                                 SHELLY
                        (in the distance, as a number 
                        is announced)
                Oh great!

                                 THOMAS J
                Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.

                                 VADA
                Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.

                                 SHELLY
                        (in the distance again, as 
                        another number is announced)
                Aarrggh.

        CLOSE UP OF HARRY AND SHELLY

        As Shelly looks around the bingo table, she notices that 
        everyone around her is chronologically advantaged in a big 
        way

                                 SHELLY
                I just had a terrible thought Harry.

                                 HARRY
                What's that?

                                 SHELLY
                I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these 
                people very soon.

                                 HARRY
                Why d'you think these seats were empty.

        OUTSIDE

                                 THOMAS J
                Can we go yet?

                                 VADA
                Go???

                                 THOMAS J
                You know I'm not allowed outside my myself 
                after dark.

        CLOSE UP AGAIN

                                 SHELLY
                Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry.

                                 HARRY
                Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending 
                upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 
                10 cards could win just as easily as a guy 
                with 100.

                                 SHELLY
                Kinda like men.

                                 HARRY
                Oh, how do you mean?

                                 SHELLY
                You can be in a room with 100 men, and not 
                like any of them, or you can be in a room with 
                just one man, and he's exactly the one you 
                want.

        Harry and Shelly are about to kiss each other, Vada sees 
        this and doesn't look too happy about it

                                 VADA
                        (in semi-deep fake voice)
                BINGO!

                                 BINGO ANNOUNCER
                We have a winner. Will the winner please 
                raise their hand?

                                 CARL
                There was no bingo, it came from outside.

                                 VERNON
                How could someone outside get a bingo?

                                 CARL
                Someone outside didn't get a bingo, someone 
                outside yelled bingo you moron!

                                 VERNON
                Who are you calling a mowon?
                        (false teeth)

                                 VERNON'S WIFE
                Put a lid on it Vernon!

                                 CARL
                Put a lid on it?? If you weren't 200 years 
                old, I'd kick your wrinkled ARSE!!

        The two old men then have a fight, Harry attempts to break 
        it up

                                 HARRY
                Hey fellers fellers, it's just a bingo game.

        Meanwhile, Shelly has found it all rather amusing

        OUTSIDE

                                 VADA
                We can go now.

        Vada and Thomas J run off down the street

        VADA'S BEDROOM NIGHT, VADA IS LYING ON HER BED THINKING

        As she hears Harry's car approaching, she goes to her 
        window and looks out it through the venetian blinds

        OUTSIDE STOPPED CAR

        Harry gets out of his side, comes round to the other side 
        and then hesitates before deciding to follow his brothers 
        advice and let Shelly get out herself, which she does, 
        eventually

                                 SHELLY
                I had a good time tonight.

                                 HARRY
                I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.

        They walk up to Shelly's camper

                                 SHELLY
                Would you like to come in and see my house? 
                Just for a minute.

                                 HARRY
                Okay, sure.

        They enter, Vada continues to watch them from her room

        INSIDE CAMPER, HARRY AND SHELLY ENTER

                                 SHELLY
                Home sweet home.

                                 HARRY
                It's nice.

                                 SHELLY
                I did it myself. I read a magazine article 
                about how to maximize small spaces.

                                 HARRY
                Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.

                                 SHELLY
                You can look in the bathroom if you want. 
                People are always curious about that, like 
                what happens when you flush.

        Harry moved toward the back of the camper and looks in the 
        bathroom, and then flushes the toilet

                                 HARRY
                Yeah.

                                 SHELLY
                Are you mad at me?

                                 HARRY
                No, why?

                                 SHELLY
                I don't know, tonight you just seemed a 
                little cool, not opening car doors and...

                                 HARRY
                Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice 
                on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of 
                touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not 
                since my wife died.

                                 SHELLY
                What happened to her?

                                 HARRY
                Ahh, complications during child birth, she 
                died two days after Vada was born.

                                 SHELLY
                Did she ever see Vada?

                                 HARRY
                I brought the baby into the room a couple of 
                times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah I think 
                she saw Vada. It was.....

        Harry looks at the item that he picked up and was fiddling 
        with to calm his nerves

                Did I ruin this?

                                 SHELLY
                Dance with me?

                                 HARRY
                Here?

                                 SHELLY
                This is where we are.

                                 HARRY
                Is there enough room?

        Shelly moves an object from the floor, which creates more 
        room

                                 HARRY
                I haven't danced in.....

                                 SHELLY
                In ages, I know, me neither.

        They begin a slow dance

                                 HARRY
                Rock?

                                 SHELLY
                See, you're not that out of touch.
                        (they dance)
                You're good.

                                 HARRY
                At Widdman High I was considered a pretty hot 
                date, I did a killer frugue.

        Shelly smells Harry's neck

                                 SHELLY
                What are you wearing?

                                 HARRY
                Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.

        They continue to dance

                                 SHELLY
                Do you want to?

                                 HARRY
                Want to what?

                                 SHELLY
                Kiss me.

                                 HARRY
                Yes.

                                 SHELLY
                Good.

        They then have a long kiss

                                 SHELLY
                Good at kissing, and dancing, I'm very 
                optimistic.

        They then kiss again, this time interrupted by the clock 
        cuckooing

                                 HARRY
                I ahh, better go.

                                 SHELLY
                It's only eight o'clock.

                                 HARRY
                Goodnight Shelly.

                                 SHELLY
                Goodnight.

        Harry exits the camper followed by Shelly who stands at the 
        door

        OUTSIDE CAMPER NIGHT, HARRY HAS JUST GOT OUT OF SHELLY'S 
        CAMPER

                                 SHELLY
                Well, I guess it's official we had a date, 
                maybe we can play bingo again sometime.

                                 HARRY
                I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that 
                drive in of yours.

                                 SHELLY
                Goodnight.

        Harry waves

        VADA'S ROOM

        Vada finishes watching, and goes to bed

        SUMMER WRITING CLASS DAY

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Before the class started, Ronda and Justin 
                wanted to lead the class in a group 
                meditation.

                WOMAN
                Ooooh that's really cool.

                                 JUSTIN
                Okay what we're gonna do is, send our vibes 
                out into the group.

        Justin turns on some kind of tape deck which begins to play 
        weird music

                                 RONDA
                Everybody hold hands, and close your eyes. 
                Relax your muscles and take deep breaths.

                                 JUSTIN
                Now, try to feel what the other person is 
                feeling, without speaking any words, send out 
                your vibe, and receive the vibes around you at 
                the same time. Can you feel it?

                                 RONDA
                Okay, open your eyes. What did everybody 
                feel?

                                 GUY
                I felt Mrs. Hunsaker's strength.

                OTHER GUY
                I can feel that Ronda is one with the Earth, 
                she's so cosmically in tune.

                                 RONDA
                So right on, that's exactly what I sent out, 
                and I felt like, you were full of inner peace 
                and harmony.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Vada, what did you feel.

                                 VADA
                I felt Justin's hangnail.

                                 JUSTIN
                No Vada, that's not what we're looking for, a 
                hangnail is insignificant. What's in my soul, 
                feel my aura.

                                 VADA
                I don't think I'm allowed to.

                                 JUSTIN
                I tell you what, let's try it again, hold 
                hands.

                                 VADA'S THOUGHTS
                Grammoo once had a hangnail on her big toe. 
                It got infected and traveled to her vocal 
                chords, it ruined her singing voice, I don't 
                think Grammoo thought it was insignificant.

        VADA'S ROOM, VADA LYING ON BED THINKING

        Vada gets out of bed and goes down corridor to see Grammoo, 
        she seats herself cross legged next to Grammoo on her bed 
        and takes her hands in an attempt to do some spiritual 
        healing

        SUPERMARKET DAY, VADA AND HARRY ARE SHOPPING

                                 HARRY
                Lettuce, watch out for the rust when you get 
                lettuce.

        Suddenly Shelly appears behind them and calls out

                                 SHELLY
                Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.

                                 VADA
                Hi.

                                 HARRY
                I'm just picking some things up for the 
                barbecue.

                                 SHELLY
                Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?

                                 HARRY
                Not at all. Lot of potatoes!

                                 SHELLY
                It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.

                                 HARRY
                I'm looking forward to that.

        Vada, who is pushing the shopping trolley behind Harry and 
        Shelly, obviously does not like the idea of Harry & Shelly, 
        and she rams her cart into Harry

                                 HARRY
                HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're 
                doing.

                                 VADA
                Sorry.

                                 SHELLY
                You know this is gonna be my first 4th of 
                July picnic in a long time.

                                 HARRY
                Really?

                                 VADA
                        (picking up large can of 
                        prunes)
                Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL 
                bad?

                                 HARRY
                Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the 
                cart, anything at all.
                        (to Shelly)
                I don't know what's gotten into her today.

        Vada begins to throw cans of every description from the 
        shelf into the shopping trolley at regular intervals, not 
        giving a stuff what they contain

                                 VADA'S THOUGHTS
                I used to like to play with my Ken and Barbie 
                dolls, Ken was my favorite. Then one Christmas 
                I got them a camper, and all they wanted to do 
                was hang out in it by themselves. So I wasn't 
                too upset when they took that wrong turn and 
                went over a cliff.

        CLOSE UP OF AMERICAN FLAG DAY, HARRY - PLAYING TUBA, 
        SHELLY, PHIL & VADA SINGING "STAR SPANGLED BANNER" AND 
        GRAMMOO STANDING NEXT TO THEM WATCHING

        MUSTANG PULLS UP NEXT TO SHELLY'S CAMPER, IT STOPS AND TWO 
        MEN GET OUT

        HARRY COOKING MEAT PATTIES ON BARBECUE, WHICH ARE BEGINNING 
        TO LOOK CHARRED, PHIL IS STANDING NEXT TO HIM

                                 PHIL
                Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry, I told you to 
                use fewer briquettes and now look what you've 
                done. You've cremated them.

                                 HARRY
                That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??

                                 PHIL
                No, no no....

                                 HARRY
                Look if you think you know how, why don't you 
                pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, 
                put out a product, support me for a while!

        Phil exits scene, Shelly comes up behind Harry

                                 SHELLY
                How's it going chef?

                                 HARRY
                Okay.

        Vada is seen turning her head to look at Harry and Shelly, 
        she doesn't like Harry and Shelly standing so close 
        together, she decides to make her move and pushes in between 
        Harry and Shelly

                                 VADA
                Are they ready yet?

                                 HARRY
                No, sweetie, not yet.

        Shelly begins to brush Vada's hair with her fingers, which 
        Vada does not like and she shakes her head to get Shelly off

                                 VADA
                When?

                                 HARRY
                Soon honey, soon.

        Shelly again tries to fix up Vada's hair
                        (which there doesn't appear 
                        to be anything wrong with)
        And Vada shakes her off again

                                 VADA
                When??

                                 HARRY
                In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll 
                burn your nose, look out.

        Vada backs off, followed by Shelly

        THE TWO MEN THAT GOT OUT OF THE CAR ARE PROCEEDING UP THE 
        SULTENFUSS' DRIVEWAY

        FOCUS ON PHIL, HARRY, VADA, SHELLY AND GRAMMOO AT THE TABLE 
        OUTSIDE, SHELLY SAYS A SEMI-GRACE

                                 SHELLY
                Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.

                                 HARRY
                I'll second that.

                                 VADA
                Hey Shelly, like seafood?

                                 SHELLY
                Uh huh, why?

                                 VADA
                See food!

        Vada opens her mouth and displays half chewed BBQ cuisine 
        to Shelly

                                 SHELLY
                        (laughing)
                That's attractive.

        Shelly's glance moves to behind Grammoo on the other side 
        of the table and beyond, where the two men are standing 
        looking around

                                 SHELLY
                        (under her breath)
                Oh shit! Excuse me...

        Shelly gets up and moves off to talk to the men, Vada and 
        Phil turn so they can see what is going on, Harry can 
        already see, Grammoo just sits staring into space

                                 MAN
                Hey Shelly, who lives here?
                        (pointing at hearse)
                The Addams Family?

                                 SHELLY
                Danny, what are you doing here?

                                 DANNY
                What am I doing here????? What am I doing 
                here?

                                 SHELLY
                        (to other man in background) 
                Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?

                                 DANNY
                You told everybody where you were going, I'm 
                here for the motor home.

        Scene shifts to Vada, Phil and Harry for a moment

                                 PHIL
                These two people do not have a good 
                relationship.

                                 SHELLY
                        (in background)
                No! _I_ bought it, _I_ paid for it...

        Scene shifts back to close up of Shelly and Danny arguing

                                 SHELLY
                I've been living in it for over a year, the 
                camper is mine.

                                 DANNY
                Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the 
                lawyer said, it's supposed to be "OUR MUTUAL 
                ASSET", not "Shelly's recreational vehicle". 
                Gimme the keys.

                                 SHELLY
                Keep your voice down!

                                 DANNY
                What?

                                 SHELLY
                The boss is watching us...

                                 DANNY
                        (sarcastic)
                I'm impressed.

                                 SHELLY
                God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.

                                 DANNY
                Yeah, all right...

        Shelly and Danny walk over to the table where the rest of 
        the family are seated, Ralph follows close behind

                                 SHELLY
                        (Talking to Danny, pointing 
                        at the people respectively)
                This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada 
                Sultenfuss...

                                 DANNY
                Vada Sultenfuss?? Tough break.

                                 VADA
                        (matter-of-fact)
                I like my name.

                                 SHELLY
                        (to the Sultenfuss')
                This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino 
                Raphael salon in Detroit.
                        (pointing at Danny)
                We used to be married.

                                 VADA
                        (extremely hopeful, to Danny)
                Are you here to take Shelly back?

        Danny shakes his head at Vada, then Harry gets up and walks 
        round the table

                                 HARRY
                Uhh, it's nice to meet ya. Uhh, we got 
                burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to 
                join us?

                                 DANNY
                Can't stay, I'm just here because my 
                wife.....

        Shelly quickly interjects

                                 SHELLY
                Ex...ex, ex...

                                 DANNY
                My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my 
                camper.

                                 HARRY
                Shelly?

                                 SHELLY
                Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I 
                promise.....

                                 DANNY
                I don't think so, I got a copy of the 
                property settlement right here.

        Danny pulls out a piece of paper

                Ahh Shit, this is my lease...... Damn it, I 
                keep forgetting things, I'm getting senile.

                                 HARRY
                Danny?

                                 DANNY
                WHAT?

                                 HARRY
                Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, 
                and there's really nothing anyone can do to 
                comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the 
                times you had with the camper, the trips you 
                took, the sights you saw, those days are gone 
                now, but they'll live on in your heart 
                forever.

                                 DANNY
                        (to Shelly)
                This guy bonking you?

                                 SHELLY
                        (disgusted)
                Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!

                                 HARRY
                        (to Danny)
                Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.

                                 DANNY
                Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?

                                 HARRY
                It's her home! It's where she lives!!

                                 DANNY
                Oh really, okay fine look, go cook,
                        (to Shelly)
                Gimme the goddam keys.

        Danny tries to grab the keys from Shelly

                                 SHELLY
                Stop it! That hurts!!

        Harry is now VERY annoyed

                                 HARRY
                Danny.....

        As Harry says "Danny" for a second time he plants his fist 
        in Danny's stomach with force, winding him and shutting him 
        up

        FOCUS ON VADA AND PHIL'S FACES, WHICH ARE STARTLED

        FULL SCENE, SHELLY IS GAPING, DANNY IS BENT OVER WITH RALPH 
        HOLDING HIM UP, VADA AND PHIL WATCHING CLOSELY AND GRAMMOO 
        STARING INTO SPACE

                                 RALPH
                What'd you do that for??

                                 HARRY
                Who are you?

                                 RALPH
                I'm his brother.

                                 HARRY
                Oh then you'll probably be visiting us here 
                quite often.

                                 RALPH
                WHY??

                                 HARRY
                Because if he ever tries to take Shelly's 
                camper again, I'm gonna bury him in my front 
                yard.

        Ralph looks rather disturbed by this

        FOCUS ON VADA AND PHIL, VADA STILL GAPING

                                 PHIL
                        (quiet voice, to Vada)
                Your father is a savage.

        Vada looks up at Phil, Phil looks back and nods

        ROAD IN FRONT OF SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, DANNY AND RALPH IN CAR, 
        SHELLY LEANING OVER WITH HER HEAD IN WINDOW NIGHT

                                 SHELLY
                Bye Ralph.

        The car with Danny and Ralph in it pulls away and Shelly 
        waves

                                 SHELLY
                        (to Harry)
                Well, you were pretty great!

                                 HARRY
                Is it really your camper?

        Shelly makes gesture with her right hand suggesting "sort 
        of"

        Suddenly a sky rocket screams up in the sky and then 
        explodes, Harry and Shelly look up and watch the fireworks

                                 SHELLY
                Can we see it from the back yard?

                                 HARRY
                You can get the general idea...

        They move off to the back yard...

                                 HARRY
                Yep, there they are... They always look the 
                same every year...

                                 SHELLY
        Pointing upwards Look...

                                 HARRY
                Did you ahh, love him?

                                 SHELLY
                I would never marry anybody I didn't love.

        VADA AND PHIL SITTING ON SEAT-SWING WATCHING FIREWORKS

                                 VADA
                He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit 
                anyone in his life.

                                 PHIL
                He likes her.

                                 VADA
                Does he love her?

                                 PHIL
                Probably.

                                 VADA
                Do you like her?

                                 PHIL
                Yes I do, and I think she's very good for 
                your father.

                                 VADA
                Why?

                                 PHIL
                After your mother died, he was sad all the 
                time, but before that, he was pretty funny.

                                 VADA
                Really?

                                 PHIL
                Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he 
                seems like the old Harry.

                                 VADA
                My Dad was funny?

                                 PHIL
                Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but 
                he made me laugh.

                                 VADA'S THOUGHTS
                My Uncle fought in the Korean war, he had a 
                steel plate put in his head, Daddy said he 
                didn't come back the same, one night, he 
                picked up a radio station from Oklahoma in his 
                teeth, it was really neat.

        DR WELTY'S SURGERY, LOOKING AT VADA WHO HAS HER MOUTH OPEN 
        WITH A TONGUE HOLDING STICK DOWN HER THROAT

                                 VADA
                Aaaaaaaaaahhhhh.

                                 VADA
                        (with stick in mouth)
                Carnnk yu sheeee ik??

        Dr. Welty removes stick from Vada's mouth

                                 VADA
                Can't you see it?

                                 DR WELTY
                No.

                                 VADA
                It's there.

                                 DR WELTY
                Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your 
                throat.

        Vada looks at the Dr.'s certificates up on the wall

                                 VADA
                Dr. Welty, are you sure those are yours?

        WAITING ROOM, NURSE RANDALL IS DEMONSTRATING A SYRINGE TO 
        THOMAS J, HOW TO USE IT AS A WATER GUN

                                 NURSE RANDALL
                So you fill it with water like this, and what 
                have you got? A water gun.

                                 THOMAS J
                Cool, can I get one for Vada?

                                 NURSE RANDALL
                Oh yes, yes.

        She gets another one out of her drawer

                Thomas, let me ask you a question. Does Vada 
                ever tell you why she comes down here so much?

                                 THOMAS J
                Cause she's dying.

                                 NURSE RANDALL
                Do you think she is?

                                 THOMAS J
                No.

                                 NURSE RANDALL
                Why do you think she says that?

                                 THOMAS J
                Cause she gets scared of all those dead 
                people in her house, and you know that saying, 
                If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if 
                she's one of them, she won't be as scared.

                                 NURSE RANDALL
                You know what I think? I think Vada's very 
                lucky to have a friend like you.

        Nurse Randall hands Thomas J another syringe

                                 THOMAS J
                She's my best friend.

        The door to the doctor's surgery opens and Vada exits

                                 NURSE RANDALL
                Miss Vada, how are you feeling?

                                 VADA
                As good as can be expected.

        CORRIDOR OUTSIDE DOCTORS WAITING ROOM

                                 THOMAS J
                Hey Vada, guess what we got?

                                 VADA
                What?

        Thomas J begins to run, and as he passes Vada he squirts 
        his syringe at Vada

                                 THOMAS J
                THIS!!
                        (squirt)

                                 VADA
                HEY YOU!!!!
                        (squirt)
                I'm gonna get you!!!
                        (squirt)
                I'll get you!!!!

        Vada at this point is unarmed, and she chases Thomas J down 
        the stairs

        FOREST DAY, VADA AND THOMAS J ARE RUNNING THROUGH IT FIRING 
        THEIR WATER GUNS AT EACH OTHER AND YELLING AT EACH OTHER, 
        HAVING FUN

        Suddenly Thomas J stops in his tracks

                                 THOMAS J
                Woah!!

                                 VADA
                What?

                                 THOMAS J
        Pointing There's a beehive right there!

                                 VADA
                So?

                                 THOMAS J
                Stand back.

        Thomas J stands a pace back behind a branch on the tree and 
        begins to squirt the beehive

                                 VADA
                Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!

                                 THOMAS J
                You're right, let's knock it down.

                                 VADA
                What do you want it for anyway?

                                 THOMAS J
                For their meat.

        The two start throwing rocks at the hive, which gets 
        damaged and eventually falls to the ground

                                 THOMAS J
                Got it!

                                 VADA
                My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it!

        They begin to search for Vada's mood ring

        Suddenly bees begin to swarm, luckily Thomas J notices in 
        time

                                 THOMAS J
                They're alive!! Run for your life!!!

        Vada just stands there looking, Thomas J comes back and 
        grabs her arm, this wakes her up and they begin to run

                                 THOMAS J
                Run faster they're after us!!

                                 VADA
                I am running faster!!

                                 THOMAS J
                Hurry!!!

        They have run to the spot with the weeping willow and the 
        pier, they run out on to the pier

                                 VADA
                Jump in the water!!

                                 THOMAS J
                But I have my clothes on!

                                 VADA
                Do it!

        UNDER WATER VIEW OF THEM BOTH, HOLDING THEIR BREATH

        INSIDE VIEW OF FRONT DOOR TO SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, VADA ENTERS 
        DRENCHED

                                 HARRY
                        (in the distance, from 
                        upstairs)
                Vada is that you?

                                 VADA
                Yes..

                                 HARRY
                Hey guess what? We're going to the carnival 
                tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes.

        Vada likes this news, she hurries up the stairs

                                 HARRY
                Shelly's coming with us.

        Vada is now not so happy

        CARNIVAL  NIGHT, FERRIS WHEEL IS SPINNING, MANY PEOPLE ARE 
        SCREAMING IN A TYPICAL CARNIVAL MANNER, SLOW ZOOM ON HARRY, 
        SHELLY AND VADA

                                 SHELLY
                So Vada, what's your favorite ride?

                                 VADA
                I like the freak show.

                                 HARRY
                I know, I know, let's go on the "sit on the 
                bench and rest" ride.

                                 SHELLY
                I don't think that that roller coaster agreed 
                with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have 
                to watch what you eat here, I remember one 
                time I went to a carnival with my cousins 
                David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, 
                and the next day they came down with 
                nephritis.

                                 VADA
                Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't 
                get it from hot dogs.

                                 SHELLY
                Well, I'm no doctor. All I know is, the next 
                day they had really high fevers, and their 
                faces got very fat. They baffled medical 
                science, they were in a magazine.

        Vada and Harry give Shelly a "yeah RIGHT" look

                                 SHELLY
                They were!! "Popular Mechanics", no "Popular 
                Science". I don't know, popular.

        HARRY, SHELLY AND VADA ARE STANDING AT A STALL WHERE OBJECT 
        IS TO GET A BALL IN FISH BOWL

                                 SHELLY
                Oh look they're trying to hit that poor 
                thing.

                                 HARRY
                Watch you don't knock out a fish.

                                 SHELLY
                Perfect.

                                 HARRY
                I don't know which ball's mine.

        Vada gets a ball in a bowl

                                 VADA
                I won, I won!!!

                                 SHELLY
                Oh great!!

                ATTENDANT
                Hooray, we have a winner,
                        (picks up fish in plastic 
                        bag)
                There you go little girl.
                        (gives fish to Vada)
                See how easy it is folks!

        Shelly inspects fish, holding it along with Vada

                                 SHELLY
                Oh Vada, that's a gorgeous goldfish.

        Vada notices something on Shelly's hand

                                 VADA
                Where'd you get that ring?

        All of a sudden Shelly looks up with a guilty look

                                 VADA
                        (extremely hopeful)
                Did you win it?

        Harry and Shelly exchange looks, Harry smiles, followed by 
        Shelly

                                 SHELLY
                Vada we have something to tell you. Harry?

        Harry sits down on table and looks at Vada in a matter-of-
        fact way

                                 HARRY
                Vada we have some good news, Shelly and I are 
                getting married.

        Vada's expression begins to change from hopeful, to horror, 
        but then she drops her fish

                                 VADA
                Oh my fish!!!

        Vada quickly bends over to pick up the fish

                                 HARRY
                We're having the wedding sometime near the 
                end of the summer.

                                 VADA
        Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little 
        fish.

                                 SHELLY
                Vada? Would you like us to get you another 
                goldfish?

                                 VADA
                        (angry)
                NO!, He's fine.
                        (less angry, talking to fish)
                Fish are very resilient animals you know. 
                Don't worry, I won't get another fish.

        Shelly and Harry exchange worried looks, Vada doesn't seem 
        to have understood

                                 ANNOUNCER

                                 SHELLY
                Oh bumper cars, oh you can't go to a carnival 
                and not ride the bumper cars.

                                 HARRY
                I fall asleep at the wheel.

                                 VADA
                        (malicious grin)
                I'll ride on the bumper cars with you!

                                 SHELLY
                Oh great Vada, come on...

        They run off leaving Harry to carry the teddy bear and the 
        fish

                                 SHELLY
                        (to the attendant)
                Uhh, two.
                        (to Vada)
                I got the blue one!!

        Vada runs in past Shelly and seats herself in a car

                                 VADA
                NO!

                                 SHELLY
                Yes!!

        Shelly gets in the blue one

                                 SHELLY
                        (pointing at Vada)
                I am gonna get you.

        Vada straps herself in, Shelly turns around and gives Vada 
        the thumbs up, Vada looks VERY intent on brutally murdering 
        something now, and she returns the thumbs up, as she does 
        so, music begins to play and the power is turned on, the 
        song is "Bad Moon Rising"

                                 HARRY
                Vada, keep your hands on the wheel!!

        Vada rushes straight at Shelly and rams into her at top 
        speed, so that Shelly's car is spun around a little, Shelly 
        screams, this is all in good fun, at the moment. Then Vada 
        rams her again, and again, and again, and again, and 
        eventually, Shelly does not look too pleased, she can't 
        escape Vada

                                 HARRY
                Careful Vada, careful.

                                 HARRY
                Shelly LOOK OUT!

        WWHHAAMMM

        Shelly and Vada pull up along side each other, Vada gives 
        Shelly a satisfied but still spiteful grin

        VADA IS RIDING HER BIKE ALONG HER STREET TOWARDS THE 
        CAMERA, SHE STOPS AND DISMOUNTS OUTSIDE THOMAS J'S HOUSE

        Vada rings the Sennett's doorbell, and Mrs Sennett answers

                                 MRS. SENNETT
                Hi Vada.

                                 VADA
                Hi, can Thomas J come out?

                                 MRS. SENNETT
                Sure, come in.

        Thomas J is coming down the stairs

                                 THOMAS J
                Hi Vada.

                                 VADA
                Hi, wanna ride bikes?

                                 THOMAS J
                Sure.

                                 MRS. SENNETT
                Ohh, did you make your bed?

                                 THOMAS J
                Yes.

                                 MRS. SENNETT
                You're sure?

                                 THOMAS J
                It's made.

                                 MRS. SENNETT
                Come here, you've got a milk mustache.

        Mrs. Sennett wipes Thomas J's lip

                                 THOMAS J
                Come on, let's go.

                                 VADA
                Bye Mrs. Sennett.

                                 THOMAS J
                Bye Ma.

                                 MRS. SENNETT
                Have fun kids.

        The two exit the house

        OUTSIDE FRONT OF SENNETT'S HOUSE, VADA AND THOMAS J ARE 
        WALKING DOWN THE STAIRS

                                 VADA
                I'm running away.

                                 THOMAS J
                Where you running to?

        They get on their bikes and begin to ride off

                                 VADA
                California, I'm going to Hollywood to live 
                with the Brady Bunch.

                                 THOMAS J
                I wanna live with them too.

                                 VADA
                No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll 
                have to live with the Partridge Family.

                                 THOMAS J
                Really?

        SOMEWHERE ON A PATHWAY IN A LIGHT FOREST, VADA AND THOMAS J 
        ARE RIDING THEIR BIKES

        Thomas J stops and then does Vada

                                 THOMAS J
                That's it.

        Thomas J goes and sits down on the river bank, Vada follows 
        with an annoyed look

                                 VADA
                Get up!?

                                 THOMAS J
                I'm tired of running away. Besides, we past 
                this place two times already. We're not 
                getting nowhere.

        Vada sits down next to Thomas J

                                 THOMAS J
                Why are you running away?

                                 VADA
                My Dad gave Shelly a ring.

                                 THOMAS J
                Wow, was it a decoder ring?

                                 VADA
                You're such a retard, it was an engagement 
                ring.

                                 THOMAS J
                They're getting married?

        Vada nods her head

                                 THOMAS J
                So now you'll have a mother.

                                 VADA
                I don't like her.

                                 THOMAS J
                I do, she's real funny.

                                 VADA
                He likes her better than me.

        A TREE DUSK, THOMAS J AND VADA ARE UP THE TOP OF IT

                                 THOMAS J
                I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.

                                 VADA
                Then go home, baby.

                                 THOMAS J
                I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.

                                 VADA
                Leave then, some friend you are.

                                 THOMAS J
                You can come to my house for dinner?

                                 VADA
                No, I'm hiding out.

                                 THOMAS J
                Okay, seeya.

        Thomas J climbs down from tree, and leaves

        DISSOLVE INTO NEXT SCENE

        VADA STILL IN TREE NIGHT, SHE LOOKS AROUND AND THEN DECIDES 
        TO GET DOWN

        Vada jumps down, and we can now see that the tree was on 
        the Sultenfuss' front lawn

        INSIDE VIEW OF FRONT DOOR, VADA ENTERS AND CLOSES IT

        As soon as Vada has entered, she waits for someone to come 
        running and ask her if she's all right, where she's been, 
        they were so worried etc., Nothing happens, all she can hear 
        is the noise that the TV is making. So she opens the door 
        again and slams it. Still nothing. She decides to give up, 
        and go find Harry, she walks to the living room where the TV 
        is on, Harry and Grammoo are asleep in their chairs

        Vada begins to ascend the stairs, depressed

                                 VADA'S THOUGHTS
                In social studies we learned some people 
                stole the Limburg baby right out of his house, 
                I think i'll sleep with my window OPEN 
                tonight.

        OUTSIDE SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, A LOUD HIGH PITCHED SCREAM IS 
        HEARD

        VIEW OF CORRIDOR LEADING TO BATHROOM

                                 VADA
                OH MY GOD!!!

        Vada bursts out of the bathroom and screams down the stairs

                                 VADA
                DADDY!! Daddy daddy!!!! Daddy!!??!?!

        Vada runs into a room where Shelly is

                                 VADA
                Daddy??!?!?!

                                 SHELLY
                Vada, Vada, what's the matter?

                                 VADA
                Where's Daddy?

                                 SHELLY
                Well he just left, what's wrong?

                                 VADA
                I'm hemorrhaging.

                                 SHELLY
                What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?

                                 VADA
                        (very weak, scared voice)
                I don't want, I don't need your help....

        Vada tries to run away, but Shelly stops her

                                 SHELLY
                Vada, did this happen in the bathroom?

        Vada nods her head

                                 SHELLY
                How old are you?

                                 VADA
                I'm eleven and a half.

                                 SHELLY
                It's okay, come on upstairs, we have to have 
                a little talk.

        They exit

        VADA'S BEDROOM, VADA AND SHELLY SITTING ON BED

                                 VADA
                My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?

                                 SHELLY
                It's actually a very beautiful thing, and 
                look there wouldn't have been a Vada.

                                 VADA
                I think it should be outlawed.

                                 SHELLY
                Believe me, some day, you'll feel 
                differently.

        Door bell is heard ringing

                                 VADA
                Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna 
                see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to 
                boys.

        OUTSIDE FRONT DOOR OF SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, VADA OPENS DOOR

                                 THOMAS J
                Hi Vada, can you come out?

                                 VADA
                I dunno..

                                 THOMAS J
                Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go 
                swimming?

        Vada is angered by this, she comes storming out

                                 VADA
                NO!

        Vada pushed Thomas J hard enough to make him fall over, she 
        is angry

                Get outta here!! And don't come back for five 
                to seven days!!!

        Vada runs inside and slams the door, leaving poor Thomas J 
        sitting on the porch looking startled

        FUNERAL ROOM OF SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, PIPE ORGAN IS BEING 
        PLAYED, MANY PEOPLE ARE SEATED AND THERE IS AN OPEN COFFIN 
        UP THE FRONT

        LIVING ROOM, VADA IS READING A BOOK, AND WATCHING GRAMMOO 
        TO BE SURE THAT SHE DOESN'T WANDER OFF, VADA PUTS THE BOOK 
        DOWN

                                 VADA
                Grammoo, I'm going to the bathroom, i'll be 
                right back.

        She then gives Grammoo a little kiss, and makes her way out 
        of the living room to the bathroom, closing the door behind 
        her, as she goes to enter the bathroom she hears giggling 
        coming from the next room, so she goes to investigate. Harry 
        and Shelly are kissing and giggling. As she is watching 
        this, Grammoo gets up, enters the funeral room and makes her 
        way to the front, when she gets there, she picks up a rose, 
        takes a look at the dead man, and begins to sing into the 
        rose as if it were a microphone

                                 GRAMMOO
                It's quarter to three, there's no-one in the 
                place, just you and me.

        As this is being sung, Vada hears and turns around with an 
        OH SHIT look on her face, Harry and Shelly also hear it 
        and make off for the funeral room, Vada quickly retreats 
        into the room where Harry and Shelly were, closing the door 
        behind her

                So santa-macho, I got a little story you 
                oughtta know, we're comin' my friend, to the 
                end of a brief episode, so make it one for my 
                baby and one more for the road.

                                 HARRY
                I'm so sorry, it's all right ma, I'm very 
                very sorry.

        ROOM IN SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, HARRY BURSTS IN, CLEARLY HE IS 
        VERY ANGRY

                                 HARRY
        Grabs Vada by the shoulders 
                Now what were you thinking, huh? HUH???? It's 
                your responsibility to watch her!! Do you have 
                any idea how upset those people are in 
                there???!

        Vada breaks free from Harry's grip, and walks briskly out 
        of the room. Shelly looks back at Harry expectantly

        WEEPING WILLOW TREE DOWN AT THE LAKES EDGE, VADA AND THOMAS 
        J ARE SITTING UNDER IT RESTING QUIETLY

                                 VADA
                Why do you think people want to get married?

                                 THOMAS J
                Well when you get older, you just have to.

                                 VADA
                I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.

                                 THOMAS J
                You can't marry a teacher, it's against the 
                law.

                                 VADA
                It is not.

                                 THOMAS J
                Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's 
                and it won't be fair.

                                 VADA
                Not true.

                                 VADA
                        (nervously, uncertain)
                Have you ever kissed anyone?

                                 THOMAS J
                Like they do on TV?

                                 VADA
                Uh huh.

                                 THOMAS J
                No.

                                 VADA
                Maybe we should, just to see what's the big 
                deal.

                                 THOMAS J
                But, I don't know how.

                                 VADA
                Here, practice on your arm like this.

        Vada brings her forearm up to her mouth and starts to kiss 
        it, Thomas J follows

                                 THOMAS J
                Like this?

                                 VADA
                Uh huh.
                        (they kiss their arms for a 
                        while)
                Okay, enough practice.

                                 VADA
                Close your eyes.

                                 THOMAS J
                But then I won't be able to see anything.

        Vada raises her fist

                                 VADA
                Just do it.

                                 THOMAS J
                Okay, okay.

                                 VADA
                Okay on the count of three.

        CAMERA SWITCHES ANGLES TO GIVE A CLEAR SIDE ON OF THOMAS J

                                 VADA
                One.

                                 VADA
                Two.

                                 VADA
                Two and a half.

                                 VADA
                Three.

        Vada leans forward and kisses Thomas J on the lips, they 
        both look surprised, Vada then sits back against the tree, 
        long pause

                                 VADA
                Say something it's too quiet.

                                 THOMAS J
                Umm, Ummmmm

                                 VADA
                        (agitated)
                Just, hurry.

        Thomas J stands up and begins to say something along the 
        lines of...

                                 THOMAS J
                On political agents to the flag of the United 
                States of America,

        Vada stands up and joins in

                                 THOMAS J & VADA
                And to the republic for which it stands, one 
                nation, under God, individual, with liberty 
                and justice for all.

        When they finish, they both still look a little 
        uncomfortable

        ROAD DAY, VADA AND THOMAS J ARE WHEELING THEIR BIKES BACK 
        DOWN IT

                                 VADA
                You better not tell anyone.

                                 THOMAS J
                You better not either.

                                 VADA
                Well, let's spit on it.

                                 THOMAS J
                Okay.

        Both of them raise their hands to their mouths and spit on 
        them, they then shake hands and when finished wipe them off 
        on their trousers

                                 VADA
                Seeya tomorrow.

                                 THOMAS J
                Okay, seeya.
                        (Vada starts off down the 
                        road)
                Vada?

                                 VADA
                What?

                                 THOMAS J
                Would you think of me?

                                 VADA
                For what?

                                 THOMAS J
                Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.

        Vada smiles, and gets on her bike

                                 VADA
                I guess.

        As Vada rides off, Thomas J smiles

        BACK IN THE WOODS WHERE VADA AND THOMAS J HAD FOUND THE 
        BEEHIVE

        Thomas J comes across the beehive, inspects it and then 
        kicks it, he waits and then once he is adamant that there is 
        no danger, he begins to search for Vada's mood ring, he 
        searches, and as he does so, bees begin to swarm, he finds 
        the mood ring, and by the time he notices that there are 
        bees everywhere, it is too late..

                                 THOMAS J
                        (as he finds the mood ring)
                Yes!

                                 THOMAS J
                        (reacting to the bees)
                Ow, ahh, NO!, Get away!!!

        We see Thomas J's glasses fall off onto the ground

        OUTSIDE FRONT DOOR, SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, POLICEMAN PRESSES 
        DOORBELL, HARRY ANSWERS

        A policeman enters, takes his hat off and explains what has 
        happened to Thomas J to Harry, who becomes clearly very 
        distressed

        VADA'S ROOM, VADA IS FEEDING FISH, HARRY ENTERS

                                 HARRY
                Hi Vada.

                                 VADA
                Hi.

                                 HARRY
                What are you doing.

                                 VADA
                Feeding my fish.

                                 HARRY
                Is that the fish you won at the carnival?

                                 VADA
                Yes.

                                 HARRY
                He's getting big.
                        (sad pause)
                Vada, come here and sit down for a minute.

        Vada sits down next to her Dad

                                 HARRY
                Vada, something happened to Thomas J last 
                night, he stepped on a beehive.

                                 VADA
                        (beginning to look worried)
                I told him not to tease those bees. Did he 
                get stung?

        Harry nods

                                 VADA
                Maybe I should go over and yell at him.

                                 HARRY
                No sweetheart, you can't.

                                 VADA
                        (looking very worried)
                Why not?

                                 HARRY
                He was allergic to bees.

                                 VADA
                        (extremely worried)
                He's okay isn't he?

                                 HARRY
                        (shakes head, near tears)
                There were just too many of 'em.

        When Vada hears this, her eyes begin to flood with tears 
        and the expression on her face changes movingly, it looks as 
        though she just lost the most special and important part of 
        her life. And she has

        VADA RUNNING UP STAIRS INTO DOCTORS OFFICE

                                 VADA
                Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??

                                 DR WELTY
                Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?

                                 VADA
                I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.

                                 DR WELTY
                Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, 
                come up here and we'll have a look.

        Dr. Welty lifts Vada up onto bed

                                 VADA
                It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.

                                 DR WELTY
                What Hurts Vada?

                                 VADA
                The bee stings! I can't breathe!

        OUTSIDE SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, HARRY AND ARTHUR ARE BRINGING 
        THOMAS J IN ON A STRETCHER

        INSIDE, CORRIDOR OUTSIDE VADA'S ROOM, SHELLY IS CLIMBING 
        STAIRS CARRYING A TRAY OF FOOD, SHE STOPS OUTSIDE VADA'S 
        ROOM

                                 SHELLY
        Knocks Vada?

        View shifts to inside Vada's bedroom, where she is curled 
        up in a little ball on her bed

                I'm leaving some food for you by the door, in 
                case you get hungry.

        Vada remains where she is, the doorbell rings

        DOWNSTAIRS, SHELLY OPENS DOOR TO REVEAL JUDY

                                 SHELLY
                Hi.

                                 JUDY
                Hi, is Vada home?

                                 SHELLY
                Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's 
                not seeing anyone.

                                 JUDY
                Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I 
                wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.

                                 SHELLY
                Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of 
                days.

                                 JUDY
                Will you tell her I came by?

                                 SHELLY
                Sure.

                                 JUDY
                Thank you. Bye.

                                 SHELLY
                Bye.

        Shelly closes the door

        PEOPLE ARE ENTERING THE FUNERAL ROOM

                                 REV
                Hi Harry.

                                 HARRY
                Ahh, Reverand Miles.

                                 REV
                The Sennetts want to thank you for taking 
                care of things so quickly.

        THE FUNERAL ROOM IS FILLING UP, WITH THOMAS J AT THE FRONT 
        IN A COFFIN

        CORRIDOR OUTSIDE VADA'S ROOM, SHELLY STOPS OUTSIDE IT

                                 SHELLY
                        (knocks)
                Vada? I see you took your tray in,

        Vada is looking out her blinds at all the black cars and 
        people dressed in black entering her house

                Maybe you should come down for the funeral, 
                sometimes it helps. Vada?

        HARRY'S STUDY, HARRY IS LOOKING AT A PIECE OF PAPER, SHELLY 
        ENTERS

                                 SHELLY
                She won't come out. It's been a whole day. 
                You have to do something Harry.

                                 HARRY
                The funeral's starting.

        Shelly is now very emotional

                                 SHELLY
                Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her 
                only friend in the world is dead.

                                 HARRY
                I know that, but what do you want from me?

                                 SHELLY
                Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I 
                first came here, the idea of working with dead 
                people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I 
                saw a family lived here, I thought, "if I'm 
                living without a family, at least I can work 
                with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be 
                invited in for supper."

                                 HARRY
                Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted 
                because there's a car crash, or there's a 
                fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.

                                 SHELLY
                I'm not asking you to stop feeling for those 
                people. But life isn't just death Harry, don't 
                ignore the living, especially your daughter.

        Arthur enters

                                 ARTHUR
                Excuse me Harry, Shelly, the minister's about 
                to begin.

                                 HARRY
                Thank you Arthur.

        FUNERAL ROOM, MINISTER IS WALKING UP THE FRONT

                                 MINISTER
                We are here to honor Thomas James Sennett. He 
                was born, May 7 1961, in Madison, 
                Pennsylvania, and he was survived by his 
                loving parents, Charles and Susan Sennett......
                        (fades as camera changes)

        CAMERA IS ON VADA, WHO IS SLOWLY MAKING HER WAY OUT OF HER 
        ROOM

        The minister is heard to say this in the background

                                 MINISTER
                The family has asked me to say a few words 
                before we proceed. No words that I could say, 
                would begin to describe the loss and grieving, 
                one word that keeps ringing in my ear is 
                Why?. Why would God choose to take this 
                little boy from us? I can't give you an answer 
                to that question, but I can tell you that God 
                has chosen Thomas J for some very special 
                reason, we must find solace in knowing that 
                Thomas J is now in Gods care. In that face, 
                there is no sorrow such as....

        The ministers words fade into the very moving music

        CAMERA IS ON VADA SLOWLY DESCENDING THE STAIRS AND LOOKING 
        INTO THE FUNERAL ROOM, THE MUSIC, SCENE AND ACTIONS OF 
        CHARACTERS IS GETTING TO THE POINT OF MAKING THE VIEWER CRY

        Vada stops and sits on a step where she can look through 
        and see Thomas J lying in his coffin, she begins to cry

        BACK IN FUNERAL ROOM, VADA ENTERS AT THE BACK AND BEGINS TO 
        SLOWLY MAKE HER WAY UP TO THE FRONT

                                 MINISTER
                ....disciples began to chastise them, and 
                Jesus said "Let the children come to me, do 
                not hinder them, for the Kingdom of God 
                belongs to such as these.
                        (the minister notices Vada 
                        coming around the front of the 
                        room)
                He laid his hands on their heads before he 
                left that place, let us pray in silence.

        Vada has made it right up to the coffin, which she leans 
        over and crying, says the following

                                 VADA
                Wanna go tree climbing Thomas J?

        CAMERA DOES A CLOSE UP OF THOMAS J'S BEE STING COVERED FACE

        CAMERA GOES BACK TO PREVIOUS SHOT INCORPORATING VADA AS 
        WELL

                                 VADA
                His face hurts, and where is his glasses? He 
                can't see without his glasses! Put his glasses 
                on!
                        (Harry and Shelly are rapidly 
                        approaching Vada, Shelly takes 
                        hold of her and tries to pull 
                        her away)
                Put on his glasses! He was gonna be an 
                acrobat.

                                 HARRY
                He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!

                                 VADA
                Get away, get away!!

        Vada breaks away from Harry's grip and runs out of the 
        room, followed closely by Harry and Shelly

        OUTSIDE THE HOUSE, VADA IS RUNNING DOWN THE STEPS, FOLLOWED 
        CLOSELY BY HARRY

                                 HARRY
                Vada wait! Vada! Vada!!

        Harry stops running after Vada as she sprints off down the 
        road

        Vada arrives at Mr. Bixler's house

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Vada! I was just on my way to your house. Are 
                you all right? I'm so sorry about Thomas J.

        Vada covers her ears and begins to sing "doo-wah-diddy-
        diddy"

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Okay, okay we don't have to talk about him, 
                Vada, Vada we don't have to talk about him, 
                it's okay. We won't talk about him all right?

                                 VADA
                        (crying)
                Justin and Ronda say that I should tell 
                people what I feel.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                        (nods)
                Come here, sit down over here.

        The two of them sit down on Mr. Bixler's porch

        Vada is clearly in a lot of pain and she wants it to stop

                                 VADA
                Mr. Bixler,
                        (emotional pause)
                I love you.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Oh, Vada...

                                 VADA
                I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna 
                live here.

                                 MR. BIXLER
        Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss 
        you.

                                 VADA
                No he wouldn't, I can't go home.

        A woman appears at Mr. Bixler's front door

                                 SUZANNE
                I'll be ready in a second, I just can't seem 
                to find my other earring....

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Suzanne, this is Vada.

                                 SUZANNE
                        (comes over to Vada and 
                        crouches)
                Vada, hi, I'm really sorry.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Could you just give us a minute?

                                 SUZANNE
                Yeah.

        Suzanne goes back inside

                                 VADA
                Who's that?

                                 MR. BIXLER
                That's Suzanne.
                        (pause)
                She and I are gonna be married this Fall.

        As soon as Vada hears this, she reacts, shaking her head 
        and backing off

                                 VADA
                No....

                                 MR. BIXLER
                I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. 
                I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please 
                honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, 
                Vada sweetheart don't.....

                                 VADA
                Get away from me!

        Vada runs off down the road

        WEEPING WILLOW, VADA AND THOMAS J'S FAVORITE SPOT, VADA IS 
        UP HIGH IN THE TREE

        Vada is climbing around in the tree, clearly trying to get 
        somewhere of significance

                                 VADA'S THOUGHTS
                Why do you think people wanna get married?

                                 THOMAS J'S VOICE
                When you get old, you just have to.

        Vada pulls out her photo of her mother

                                 THOMAS J'S VOICE
                Who's that with your Dad?

                                 VADA'S THOUGHTS
                It's my mother.

                                 THOMAS J'S VOICE
                I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
                        (pause)
                Vada, would you think of me? Well if you 
                don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.

                                 VADA'S THOUGHTS
                Now we're blood brothers for life.

        Vada gets out to the end of a branch, and makes a daring 
        jump to another, had she fallen she would be dead

                Shelly I'm sorry but we haven't found her

                We'll keep looking.

                                 SHELLY
                We, no, we've been looking since this 
                morning, her teacher called, and he said that 
                she went there first.....

        Shelly is cut off as the door opens and in walks a very 
        shaken Vada

                                 SHELLY
                Vada. Are you okay?
                        (Vada nods)
                Oh God.

        Shelly embraces Vada

        VADA'S ROOM, SHELLY AND VADA ARE SITTING ON VADA'S BED, 
        SHELLY IS BRUSHING VADA'S HAIR

                                 VADA
                I should have told Thomas J that he was my 
                best friend.

                                 SHELLY
                I'm sure he knew.

        Shelly puts a nightie on Vada

                                 VADA
                Shelly, I stole some money from your cookie 
                jar, to pay for the writing class.

        Shelly ponders this for a moment

                                 SHELLY
                It's okay sweetheart.

                                 VADA
                I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll 
                ever go to class again.

                                 SHELLY
                I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first 
                book to me, and we'll forget about the whole 
                thing.

                                 VADA
                I will I promise.

                                 SHELLY
                Okay, get in to bed.

        Vada gets into bed and extends her arms to Shelly, they hug 
        each other, Vada has finally accepted Shelly

                                 SHELLY
                Goodnight.

                                 VADA
                Goodnight.

        Shelly exits and turns off the lights

        DOWNSTAIRS, HARRY ENTERS

                                 SHELLY
                        (sitting on stairs)
                She's in.

        BACK IN VADA'S ROOM

        Harry enters, walks over and kisses Vada, then turns around 
        and begins to exit

                                 VADA
                Did I kill my mother?

                                 HARRY
                What??

                                 VADA
                The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my 
                mother.

                                 HARRY
                No, no.

        Harry pulls up a chair and sits down next to Vada

                                 HARRY
                No sweetie that wasn't your fault, things 
                like that aren't anybody's fault, it just 
                happened.

        Vada pulls out the photo of Harry and Vada's Mom from under 
        her pillow

                                 VADA
                I found this.

                                 HARRY
                I forgot about that picture, where did you 
                find it?

                                 VADA
                In the garage.

                                 HARRY
                Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers 
                favorite car.

                                 VADA
                What was my mama like?

                                 HARRY
                She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. 
                Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when 
                you laugh, you sound just like her.

                                 VADA
                Really?

                                 HARRY
                Uh huh. You know what your mother did when 
                she found out she was gonna have you? She came 
                home and painted this whole room pink. She was 
                so sure she was gonna have a little girl.

                                 VADA
                Do you miss her?

                                 HARRY
                Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and 
                even now, I get a little sad when I think of a 
                pretty flower or a sunset that your mother 
                would have liked.

                                 VADA
                I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll 
                think of Thomas J.

                                 HARRY
                That's good, memories are good sweetheart. 
                Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from 
                you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and 
                I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump 
                like me.
                        (Vada puts the photo back 
                        under her pillow, Harry gets 
                        up and kisses her)
                Seeya in the morning.

        Harry begins to leave room

                                 VADA
                Daddy, it's not so bad to be like you.

        A CAFE IN TOWN, HARRY IS EATING, MRS. SENNETT COMES AND 
        KNOCKS ON THE WINDOW

        Harry makes his way out of the cafe to talk to Mrs. Sennett

                                 HARRY
                Mrs. Sennett, how are you doing?

                                 MRS. SENNETT
                Some days I think i'll be okay, others, well 
                I have to force myself even to get out of bed, 
                I know it's crazy, but sometimes I think he's 
                just away at summer camp. How's Vada?

                                 HARRY
                Oh she's doing much better. Ahh she's just 
                inside.
                        (walks over to entrance)

                VADA!

        Vada, who is inside talking to someone, hears and comes 
        outside

                                 VADA
                Mrs. Sennett.
                        (she runs and gives her a 
                        hug)

                                 MRS. SENNETT
                Vada. I've been wanting to come over to see 
                you,
                        (she reaches inside her purse 
                        and gets out something, it is 
                        Vada's mood ring)
                Thomas J had this on him, I thought you might 
                like to have it.

        Vada slides the ring onto her finger, the ring is BLUE

                You were such a good friend to him, I hope 
                you'll still come by and visit me.

                                 VADA
                I will, I promise.

        Mrs. Sennett looks at Harry as if to say good-bye, and then 
        walks off slowly

                                 VADA
                Mrs. Sennett.
                        (she stops and turns around 
                        to look at Vada)
                Thomas J will be all right, my mother will 
                take care of him.

                                 MRS. SENNETT
                Thank you Vada.

        She then turns and walks off

        SUMMER WRITING CLASS, FOCUS ON MR. BIXLER

                                 MR. BIXLER
                        (reading from book)
                Encased in talent, like a uniform, the rank 
                of every poet, is well known. They can amaze 
                us like a thunderstorm, or die so young, or 
                live for years alone. My advice to you on our 
                last class, be a thunderstorm.

                                 JUSTIN
                What exactly do you mean by that?

                                 MR. BIXLER
                I mean, be dangerous
                        (Vada enters the back of the 
                        room)
                And unpredictable. And make a lot of noise.

        Mr. Bixler sees Vada

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Vada.

        As Vada is noticed, she goes around getting hugged by 
        everyone

                                 JUSTIN
                Hey, we missed you man! Gimme a hug!

        Vada gives Justin a hug, she then proceeds towards Mr. 
        Bixler

                                 MR. BIXLER
                I was hoping you'd stop by today.

        Vada and Mr. Bixler hug each other

                                 VADA
                I can't stay, I just came to read my poem.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                We'd love to hear it.

                                 VADA
                Weeping willow with your tears running down, 
                Why do you always weep and frown, Is it 
                because he left you one day, Is it because he 
                could not stay, On your branches he would 
                swing, Do you long for the happiness that they 
                would bring, He found shelter in your shade, 
                He thought his laughter would never fade, 
                Weeping willow stop your tears, There is 
                something to calm your fears, You think death 
                as if you forever part, But I know he'll 
                always be in your heart.

        There is a long pause as it sinks in, everybody remains 
        silent, then just before the scene changes, the Temptations 
        song "My Girl" begins to play

        OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL, VADA COMES OUT THE DOOR AND DOWN THE 
        STEPS WHERE JUDY AWAITS HER

                                 VADA
                Hi Judy.

                                 JUDY
                Hi Vada.

                                 VADA'S THOUGHTS
                Things are a little better these days; I 
                finally swallowed that chicken bone, Judy and 
                I are gonna be in the same home room and the 
                republican party just re-nominated Mr. Nixon.

        Vada and Judy ride off down the road on their bikes, the 
        camera angle rises and the credits begin to roll as the song 
        My Girl plays


        THE END

          1 EXT. TILBURY DOCKS. DAY. 1

           Over a DARK SCREEN we see the caption:
           "This is a fairy story, an episode out of time and space,
           which nevertheless was real" - Colin Clark.
           Then, FADE UP ON:
           Newsreel footage of SIR LAURENCE OLIVIER AND VIVIEN LEIGH
           arriving back at Tilbury Docks to be greeted by an excited
           crowd of fans. As they progress down the gangplank and stop
           to sign autographs we HEAR an excited commentary OVER:

                          COMMENTATOR
           "Returning to England are
           Britain's acting royalty Sir
           Laurence Olivier and Lady
           Olivier, better known as stunning
           Gone With The Wind star Vivien
           Leigh. Sir Laurence has added a
           new string to his bow with the
           announcement that he is to direct
           and star in a screen version of
           Terence Rattigan's stage play The
           Sleeping Prince with none other
           than Hollywood siren Marilyn
           Monroe. When the world's greatest
           actor romances the most famous
           woman alive, we can be sure that
           sparks will fly. Now, now Lady
           Olivier, don't worry - any
           romance is strictly for the
           camera!"
           As OLIVIER and VIVIEN smile for the photographers, we -

          2 EXT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. DAY. 2

           It is 1956. Saltwood Castle, the family home of the Clark
           family, looms over the landscape, framed by the setting
           sun. It is majestic, an Englishman's dream of a home,
           complete with turrets and even a moat. There is a feeling
           of timeless beauty and stability about the scene, something
           profoundly English.
           We are a very long way from Hollywood.

                          CUT TO:

                         

          3 EXT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. GARDEN. DAY. 3

           COLIN CLARK, 23, hurries across the lawn carrying a bag, he
           is casually dressed, boyish and handsome. He heads towards a
           beautiful, ramshackle building and through the ancient oak
           doors.

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 2.

                         

          3A INT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. LIBRARY STAIRS. DAY. 3A

           COLIN bounds up the stairs into the Library.

                         

          3B INT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. LIBRARY. DAY. 3B

           As COLIN enters, he sees SIR KENNETH CLARK, standing in front
           of a painting on an easel by the Italian Baroque painter,
           Annibale Carracci. He has two STUDENTS with him, a man and a
           woman in their early 20s, and is in mid-description of the
           painting.

                          KENNETH
           ... and this is one of Carracci's
           earlier works and one is able to
           see the emergence of his now famous
           Baroque style, which is clearly
           rooted in the tradition of high
           renaissance and antiquity...
           COLIN pauses briefly and hurries towards them. Throughout the
           scene there is a sense of his urgency and desire to go. The
           whole thing should be played at breakneck pace. KENNETH beams
           affectionately.

                          KENNETH
           Colin! Come in. Have you met James
           and Anna? Two very brilliant
           pupils.
           He has the avuncular air of a benign academic, affable and a
           little eccentric. COLIN smiles hurriedly at the students, no
           time to waste.

                          COLIN
           I'm leaving for London now, Pa.

                          KENNETH
           Ah, yes. Well, bon chance, dear
           boy...
           He puts a friendly arm around COLIN's shoulder and starts to
           walk him back to the door.

                          KENNETH
           I can always get you a research
           position at the V&A when you've
           grown up a bit and got this film
           idea out of your system...
           COLIN's smiles but before he can reply JANE CLARK whirls into
           the room, a ball of energy, talking nineteen to the dozen.

                          JANE
           Kenneth, you might have told Cook
           we were another two for dinner.
           What is everyone supposed to eat?
           Cabbage soup? Oh, Colin, darling,
           there you are...

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 2A.

                         
           She looks wonderful in a good quality but elderly dress,
           eccentrically combined with gardening attire, her mind on a
           dozen things at once.

           I'm off now, Mama.

           Off?

                          COLIN
           My job interview, remember..?
           But she is already continuing her journey. COLIN smiles
           hurriedly at KENNETH, who gives him an affectionate wave as
           COLIN dashes after his mother. She leaves the Library.

           JANE strides across the lawn with COLIN rushing to catch up.

                          JANE
           Can't you stay for dinner? There's
           nothing to eat but I'm sure the
           conversation will be charming.

                          COLIN
           I don't want to be late in the
           morning.
           As COLIN hurries after JANE he is nearly run down by an
           elderly GARDENER with a lawn mower, and has to take lightning
           evasive action. JANE doesn't notice.

                          JANE
           I'm sure they won't mind. You'll be
           a famous film director in no time.
           I know your father's put in a word.

                          COLIN
           I wish he hadn't done that. I can
           manage on my own.
           She stops so abruptly he nearly slams into her. JANE looks
           around the garden with a frown.

                          JANE
           I have to watch Jenkins like a
           hawk. One more of his murderous
           prunings and we'll lose the tea
           roses for ever.
           And she's off again, with COLIN still following. He can't
           help smiling at the madness of it all.

           The sun is setting, casting a golden glow over the castle.
           COLIN and JANE emerge from the front door, COLIN pauses in
           the driveway and dumps his bag in the back of his old but
           racy MG Sports car. Only now does JANE really turn her
           attention fully to him for the first time.

                          JANE
           Now go and have a lovely time,
           darling. We're always here when
           you're ready to talk your future.
           COLIN wants to protest but before he can get the words out
           JANE sees a YOUNG GARDENER walking at the side of the house
           with a wheel barrow. Her face lights up.

                          JANE
           Mullins! Be an angel - find Cook
           and ask her how many pork chops we
           need for tonight. Then bring the
           car round. I must get to the
           village before the shop shuts...
           She dashes away after the GARDENER, turning back as an
           afterthought to blow a kiss at COLIN as she goes.
           COLIN smiles, then pauses for a moment to look at the house.
           We can sense both his affection for it but more pressingly
           his need to get away.
           He gets in, puts the car in gear and the Bristol pulls out of
           the drive and across the moat. In the last rays of the sun,
           the countryside looks magical, but Colin only has eyes for
           the road ahead.

           A sharp contrast with the hazy beauty of the countryside.
           It is early morning in the heart of London's West End. The
           streets hum with activity as OFFICE WORKERS in hats and
           raincoats stream from the tube stations.
           COLIN pushes his way through the early morning crowds in
           Piccadilly. This is his patch; he is very much at home
           here, negotiating the busy streets with ease. As he passes
           by the upmarket Burlington Arcade a TAILOR pauses in
           measuring a suit for a client to give him a familiar wave.
           COLIN waves back.

           Checking his watch he runs the last few yards then stops
           outside the imposing facade of 144 Piccadilly. A plaque
           outside the door announces: LAURENCE OLIVIER PRODUCTIONS.
           Colin fingers his carefully knotted tie to make sure
           everything is correctly in place, then goes to the door and
           rings the bell.

           The reception area is luxurious - deep pile carpets and
           plush sofas. VANESSA, the beautiful secretary, sits behind
           her imposing desk, gazing doubtfully at COLIN.

                          VANESSA
           You're not in Mr. Perceval's
           diary.

                          COLIN
           Larry told me to come.
           She pauses dubiously, then reaches for her telephone. We
           hear a man answer in an office down the hall, his voice
           carrying irritably.

           says Sir Laurence sent him.
           She stresses the proper name in disapproval of Colin's
           familiarity.

           executive. He is tall and gloomy, with black-rimmed
           spectacles and thinning dark hair. He looks at COLIN grimly
           as he stuffs his pipe with tobacco.

           PERCEVAL gives him a grim stare as he goes through to his
           office. VANESSA glances up from her typewriter. He meets her
           eye optimistically but she ignores him.

           Despite his modest triumph he is back where he started. The
           seconds pass in dull silence. He is beginning to think his
           campaign will fail. But then, in a heartbeat, everything
           changes.
           He looks up in surprise as the door bursts open and SIR

           his arm.

          At the age of 49 SIR LAURENCE OLIVIER is at the peak of his
          fame. He is handsome and charismatic, and VIVIEN is
          scarcely less extraordinary. The Gone With The Wind star
          remains classically lovely, flirtatious and captivating.
          Individually they are charismatic enough, but together they
          are electrifying, seeming to charge the air around them
          with the power of their personalities, galvanising anyone
          who comes into contact with them.
          VANESSA leaps to her feet and PERCEVAL hurries to greet
          them as COLIN stands up uncertainly. OLIVIER is all amiable
          bluster and bonhomie.

           Do you know, Hughie, it is simply
           impossible to get Marilyn Monroe on
           the telephone? The darling girl
           spends the entire day asleep. But
           great beauty has its way...
          He laughs, but then notices VIVIEN's less than enthusiastic
          response. Seeking refuge in some distraction he notices
          COLIN hovering by the sofa.

                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
           Hello, boy... remind me?
          He smiles vaguely and glances at VIVIEN for help.

                          VIVIEN
           You remember Colin, darling. You
           met him at the Clarks' party.

                          OLIVIER

                          (NO IDEA)
           Of course. What are you doing
           here?

                          COLIN
           You said there might be a job on
           your film.
          OLIVIER has no recollection of this and fumbles in his
          pockets to cover his confusion, bringing out a packet of
          cigarettes and offering them to COLIN with breezy charm.

                          OLIVIER
           Have a cigarette. Keep the pack.
          He turns quickly to PERCEVAL.

                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
           There won't be any film unless
           Miss Monroe gets her splendid
           posterior out of bed.

                          PERCEVAL
           The House Committee are
           threatening to withhold Miller's
           passport. They say he's a
           communist. No Arthur, no Marilyn.

                          OLIVIER
           I'll have a word with the
           American ambassador. I'm taking
           him to see Vivien in South Sea
           Bubble on Thursday... now, tell
           me, Hughie, are Terry's rewrites
           in?
          He puts an arm around PERCEVAL's shoulders and they
          disappear together into Perceval's office.
          VIVIEN lingers behind, smiling radiantly at COLIN who looks
          dumbly at the packet of cigarettes in his hand. He now sees
          they are called "Oliviers". VIVIEN wrinkles her nose in
          amusement.

                          VIVIEN
           They named them after Larry. The
           first actor since Du Maurier to
           have his own brand and they pay
           him an absolute fortune. (Pause)
           I'm afraid they're rather
           ghastly.
          She cups Colin's cheeks with her hands and studies him in
          mock awe.

                          VIVIEN (CONT'D)
           Isn't he gorgeous, Vanessa?

                          VANESSA
           I suppose he's all right.
          VIVIEN's eyes sparkle. OLIVIER emerges from the office with a
          handful of script pages and VIVIEN looks at him slyly,
          getting her own back for his tactless over-praise of
          Marilyn's charms as she strokes COLIN's cheek.

           Let's elope together and have the
           most glorious affair. (Arch) Oh,
           but then, who'd look after my
           poor Larry?
           Olivier glances over with a faint look of exasperation.
           VIVIEN winks at COLIN and takes her husband's arm.

                          VIVIEN (CONT'D)
           Now, darling, you must do
           something for Colin. You
           absolutely promised.
           OLIVIER looks hunted. There is no way out. He glances back
           at PERCEVAL as he comes in.

                          OLIVIER
           Let's try to find him something
           to do, Hughie.
           COLIN grins in triumph. VIVIEN smiles at him.

                          VIVIEN
           You will take care of my precious
           Larrykins, won't you?
           She flirtatiously offers up her cheek for COLIN to kiss.
           COLIN's smile falters as he sees PERCEVAL looking at him
           grimly.

                         

          20 INT. 144 PICCADILLY. HUGH PERCEVAL'S OFFICE. DAY. 20

           COLIN stands eagerly at PERCEVAL's desk. PERCEVAL looks at
           him, more than usually brusque.

                          20
           COLIN knocks and walks into Perceval's office, carrying a
           tray with tea and a plate of biscuits. The blinds are closed
           and a 16mm projector is running; silent images play on a fold-
           up screen in the corner of the room.
           Framed in the light of the projector are PERCEVAL and the
           film's lighting cameraman JACK CARDIFF. They take no notice
           of Colin.
           He looks up at the screen. The two men are watching make-up,
           hair and wardrobe tests for the film. MARILYN MONROE in
           character as Elsie Marina.

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 12A.

                         
           The film shows Marilyn looking sweet and pretty, chatting
           silently to someone just off camera, mugging playfully in
           costume, larking about with her hair - and then, when she
           wants to, turning on her full film star wattage and looking
           wonderful, every inch the beautiful icon.
           It is an intimate glimpse of her at work. Colin watches,
           fascinated, completely forgetting why he's there, still
           holding the tray -

                          PERCEVAL

                          (TO CARDIFF)
           Larry says he particularly likes
           this dress. She looks radiant.

                          CARDIFF
           Exactly - we need to tone her down
           a bit.

                          PERCEVAL
           How the hell do you tone down
           Marilyn Monroe?!
           COLIN laughs. He immediately regrets it. Both men turn to
           look at him. PERCEVAL turns off the projector and gazes at
           him stonily.

                          PERCEVAL
           Marilyn Monroe's publicist is

           COLIN nods eagerly, anxious to get out. He is already at the
           door when PERCEVAL barks at him again.

                          PERCEVAL
           And leave the bloody tea.
           COLIN had forgotten the tray. He blushes furiously, puts it
           down and hurries out.

                         

          21 EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. DAY. 21

           COLIN has a map spread out on the bonnet of his Bristol
           sports car. He finds Pinewood Studios then draws a ring
           around its circumference. He taps his pencil thoughtfully
           as he lights a cigarette - one of the branded pack that
           Olivier gave him. He inhales deeply, thinking, then
           grimaces in distaste, quickly stubbing it out under his
           foot.

           COLIN pulls into the drive of Tibbs Farm, a charming
           English cottage.

           COTES-PREEDY, the owner, clearly has a very high opinion of
           Tibbs Farm. Aloof and snobbish, he stands by the front
           door, looking down his nose at COLIN.

                          COTES-PREEDY
           Out of the question. I can't have
           a lot of awful film people
           tramping through the house in
           dirty boots.

                          COLIN
           We'd pay a hundred pounds per
           week for 18 weeks.

                          COTES-PREEDY
           My wife would never agree.

                          COLIN
           That's a pity. I'll have to tell
           Miss Monroe to look elsewhere,
           then.
           COTES-PREEDY double takes.

                          COTES-PREEDY
           Marilyn Monroe?

           She's making a film with Sir
           Laurence Olivier. The Sleeping
           Prince. From the play by Terence
           Rattigan.

           of years ago. Vivien Leigh was
           marvellous.

                          COLIN
           It's Marilyn Monroe in the film.

           ARTHUR JACOBS, Marilyn's publicist, is a close-cropped,
           pugnacious figure in his mid-forties. He waits impatiently
           outside Olivier's office, a stack of newspapers under his
           arm. COLIN comes hurrying up, smiling brightly.

                          COLIN
           Good morning, Mr. Jacobs. I hope
           you had a pleasant flight.

                          JACOBS

           JACOBS sits in the passenger seat of Colin's Bristol sports
           car reading his stack of newspapers. After a moment he
           grunts in disgust.

                          JACOBS
           Jeez, do you Brits actually read
           this stuff?
           He winds down his window and simply throws the whole lot
           out into the lane. The pages billow out in a great cloud
           behind the speeding car, landing in the pretty hedgerows
           and on neat front lawns.
           COLIN gapes in astonishment. Welcome to Hollywood.

           JACOBS slouches out of the house, magnificently
           unimpressed. COTES-PREEDY follows him proudly with COLIN at
           his side. JACOBS takes a long, unimpressed look at the
           property.

                          JACOBS
           What is this place? A brothel?
           COTES-PREEDY's face falls.

           Is this the best you can do?

                          COLIN
           It's very near Pinewood.

                          JACOBS
           All right. We'll take it. (Pause)

           JACOBS slaps down a copy of the Evening Standard on the
           desk. The front page carries a picture of Tibbs Farm with
           the caption: "Exclusive - Marilyn's Luxury Home In
           England". He jabs a finger at it angrily.

           News travels fast.

                          JACOBS
           That house was perfect for
           Marilyn.

                          PERCEVAL
           We can't use it now.

                          COLIN
           Yes we can. I knew Cotes-Preedy
           wouldn't be able to keep this
           quiet.
           They stare to him in surprise. He looks at them boldly.

                          COLIN
           When you asked me to find a house
           for Miss Monroe I took the
           precaution of finding two. The
           other one, Parkside, is much
           better and the owner is very
           discreet.

                          PERCEVAL
           But now we have two expensive
           houses when we only wanted one.

           I thought someone else on the
           production might want it.

           Oh, did you?
           There is a dangerous moment when things could go either
           way. COLIN has gambled everything in a bid to impress them.

           He waits in tense silence, staring at their puzzled
           expressions. But then JACOBS shrugs.

                          JACOBS
           I guess Milton could use it. It's
           near the studio, near Marilyn.
           OLIVIER looks at COLIN, then bursts out laughing.

           What are we paying you, boy?
           He glances at COLIN with amusement.

           Beige, then. Beige is rarely
           controversial.
           JACOBS considers this, unaware that Olivier is teasing him.

                          JACOBS
           I guess that's okay. She's never
           said nothing about beige. Paula
           will need the room next door.

                          COLIN
           Paula?

                          JACOBS
           Strasberg. Marilyn's acting
           coach.
           OLIVIER looks at him darkly. JACOBS shrugs.

                          JACOBS (CONT'D)
           She's nuts about the Method.

                          OLIVIER
           Stanislavski and the Method are
           perfectly fine in the rehearsal
           room but they don't belong on a
           film set. Time is too tight. I'm
           sure Marilyn understands.
           He turns and walks away. JACOBS frowns uncertainly.

           COLIN stands in the Production Office. DAVID ORTON (30s)
           the First Assistant Director, a thin, fair-haired man
           regards him with obvious irritation.

                          ORTON
           I don't know why Hugh Perceval
           sent you here. There's nothing I
           can do for you.

                          COLIN
           Why not?

                          ORTON
           Are you in the union?

           No...

                          ORTON
           Then you can't have a job on the
           film.

                          COLIN
           How do I get in the union?

                          ORTON
           By getting a job on the film.

                          COLIN
           But you just said I couldn't have
           a job on the film unless I was in
           the union.

                          ORTON
           Exactly. It's called a closed
           shop.
           COLIN looks at him helplessly. ORTON relents a little.

                          ORTON (CONT'D)
           I suppose I might be able to sort
           something out. The Union owes me
           a few favours. We haven't got a
           third yet.

                          COLIN
           A third?

           Christ, no! That's the last thing
           you do. Lesson One. The third's
           job is to do whatever the fuck I
           tell him.
           ORTON walks to the door, then looks back.

           PERCEVAL sits with COLIN and ROGER SMITH. SMITH is a
           dignified figure in his mid-fifties. His erect bearing
           speaks of a lifetime in the police.

                          PERCEVAL

           I've never had much time for the
           pictures.

           PERCEVAL pauses awkwardly.

                          PERCEVAL
           Her behaviour is reputedly a
           little... erratic.

           She drinks?

                          ROGER
           Pills?
           PERCEVAL leaves a tactful pause.

                          PERCEVAL
           It would be useful if you could
           keep us informed of her...
           domestic situation.

                          ROGER
           You want me to spy on her?
           Perceval and Roger understand each other perfectly.

                          PERCEVAL
           Just the odd early warning if you
           know she's going to be late on

                          MARILYN
           My husband is.
          She looks adoringly at Miller, who smiles vaguely.

                          REPORTER 2
           What's your definition of an
           intellectual, Marilyn?

                          MARILYN
           I guess you could look it up in a
           dictionary.
          This time the laughter is emphatically on MARILYN's side.
          One of the reporters turns to VIVIEN.

                          REPORTER
           Vivien, you created the part of
           Elsie Marina on stage. Do you
           have any advice for Marilyn?

                          VIVIEN
           I am sure if Miss Monroe needs
           any advice she'll get it from her
           director. I hear he's terribly
           good.
          The reporters laugh with her and OLIVIER smiles graciously.
          But as she smiles at him we detect just a flicker of
          jealous hurt in her eyes. OLIVIER intervenes quickly to
          continue his prepared speech of welcome.

                          OLIVIER
           In The Sleeping Prince we have
           discovered the perfect vehicle
           for Miss Monroe's luminous and
           justly celebrated talent...
          He stops as a REPORTER shouts over him.

                          JACOBS
           Marilyn, is it true you wear
           nothing in bed except Chanel No

           5?

                          MARILYN
           As I'm in England let's say I
           sleep in nothing but Yardley's
           Lavender.

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 25.

                         
           The press laugh in delight. On the edge of the crowd COLIN
           watches her, amused and impressed.

          41 EXT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. GATES. DAY 41

           A convoy of cars pass through the throng of JOURNALISTS
           waiting at the gate. Marilyn's "secret" hideaway is no
           longer much of a secret. The classical old house is elegant
           and luxurious.

                         

          42 EXT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. FRONT DOOR. DAY. 42

           Outside the front door MARILYN, MILLER, OLIVIER and VIVIEN
           have their picture taken by the official PHOTOGRAPHER.
           ROGER watches unobtrusively.

                          VIVIEN
           Are all your press conferences
           like that, darling?

                          MARILYN
           Well, that was quieter than some.
           Vivien smiles at the wry joke. ARTHUR JACOBS watches the
           proceedings with an eagle eye.

                          JACOBS
           Okay, let's get a snap of the
           newlyweds. Smile, Arthur. It's
           not a firing squad.
           As the group breaks up, MILTON GREENE, handsome and dark-
           haired, now approaches OLIVIER and COLIN.

                          MILTON
           This is some place you found.
           He glances at the house. Olivier smiles generously.

                          OLIVIER
           You have my new assistant Colin
           to thank for that. (Pause, he
           shepherds COLIN over) This is
           Milton Greene. You must be very
           nice to him. He owns half of
           Marilyn Monroe Productions.

                          MILTON
           Forty nine per cent, Larry.
           GREENE (34) offers them a tired smile.
           OLIVIER produces one of his branded packets and offers a
           cigarette to Milton.

          MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 25A.

                         

                          OLIVIER
           Have a cigarette.

                          MILTON
           I don't smoke.
          If he notices the "Olivier" name he doesn't show it.
          OLIVIER looks mildly put out.

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 26.

                         

                          OLIVIER
           Milton - Marilyn and rehearsals.
           Let's talk.

                          MILTON
           Sure. And the studio wants a new
           title.
           OLIVIER escorts Milton away.
           MILLER and MARILYN are now being photographed on their own.
           ROGER moves over to JACOBS and murmurs discreetly in his
           ear. JACOBS nods and moves in to end the session.

                          JACOBS
           The boys at the gate are getting
           restless.

                          MILLER
           Let's give them two minutes and
           then we're done.
           ROGER waves to the POLICEMEN, who open the gates. The PRESS
           come pouring in like a mob of revolutionaries storming the
           Bastille.

           COLIN notices Marilyn grip Miller's hand tightly as the
           flashbulbs pop all around her. A moment later he is
           surprised to find VIVIEN at his elbow.

                          VIVIEN
           Marvellous, isn't she? I suppose
           you're quite smitten.
           COLIN looks at her shrewdly, sensing he is being tested.

                          COLIN
           She's all right. A bit common.

                          VIVIEN

                          (LAUGHS)
           Larry fell desperately in love
           with her in New York. He's
           determined to seduce her.

                          COLIN
           But she's only been married three
           weeks.

                          VIVIEN
           Oh, Colin, I thought you were a man
           of the world.
           She gives him an arch smile and leans in intimately.

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 27.

                         
           VIVIEN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
           Of course, Larry would never leave
           me. (Pause) But, if anything were
           to happen, you would let me know,
           wouldn't you?

                          COLIN
           I'm sure he loves you very much.
           There is a flash of sudden anger in her expression.

                          VIVIEN
           Oh, don't be such a boy!
           COLIN looks shaken and she touches his hand in contrition.

                          VIVIEN (CONT'D)
           At least you still adore me,
           don't you?

                          COLIN
           Of course. Everyone does.
           There is a wintry bleakness in her face for a second.

                          VIVIEN
           I'm 43, darling. No one will love
           me for much longer. Not even you.
           He goes to protest but she stills him with a finger to his
           lips, her smile quickly restored.

          44 EXT. DOG AND DUCK PUB. DAY. 44

           The Dog and Duck is a rundown pub in an out of the way lane
           near the studios. It is a rough, local place utterly devoid
           of glamour or comfort. COLIN stands outside, staring at it
           grimly, his bag in his hand.

           A few hard-core LOCALS stand nursing their pints at the bar.
           One is idly throwing darts. The wallpaper is faded yellow
           with cigarette smoke, stale sandwiches curl in a display
           case. COLIN looks around, his heart sinking. BARRY, the
           landlord looks him up and down, disparagingly.

                          COLIN
           Colin Clark. I booked a room.
           BARRY takes a dusty ledger from beneath the bar, spins it
           around for COLIN to sign.

                          BARRY
           What brings you up this way?

          MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 27A.

                         
          COLIN can't help looking a little pleased with himself.

                          COLIN
           I'm here working on a film.
          The LOCALS look up from their pints, unimpressed.

                          BARRY
           What film's that?

                          COLIN
           It's called `The Sleeping Prince'.
          The darts player, ANDY, doesn't turn. His aim remains
          steady.

                          ANDY
           Sounds lousy.

                          BARRY
           Ignore, Andy - not a film fan - are
           you, Andy?
          ANDY doesn't look away from his game.

                          ANDY
           Can't be bothered.
          COLIN tries to impress.

                          COLIN
           Marilyn Monroe's in it. I'll be
           working with her.

                          BARRY
           Oh, will you now?
          The regulars grin unkindly into their pints. ANDY doesn't
          look away from his game, as he offers laconically:

                          ANDY
           The Queen and Prince Philip popped
           in for a pint earlier. Pity, you
           just missed them.
          There are supportive snorts of derision from the LOCALS.
          COLIN takes it on the chin. BARRY hands him a key.

                          BARRY
           The room's three quid a week, first
           week in advance. You're in number
           two.
          COLIN takes the key and his bag, just as BARRY adds, with
          perfect deadpan timing:

                          BARRY (CONT'D)
           You'll be sharing with Grace Kelly.
          The LOCALS laugh into their beer. COLIN smiles gamely.

          45 INT. DOG AND DUCK PUB. COLIN'S ROOM. DAY. 45

           COLIN stands aghast. He is staying in a grim little room
           above the noisy saloon bar. The wallpaper is peeling, the
           furniture is ancient and the whole place reeks of damp.
           Dirty net curtains flutter in the window. He puts his bag
           on the bed and sits down. The mattress sags pitifully. He
           looks down and finds a stained and yellowing chamber pot
           under the bed. He slides it back with a look of revulsion.

           The principal cast of The Sleeping Prince, as it was still
           known at the time, assemble on the sound stage amongst the
           half-finished set. They chat and smoke, their scripts in
           their hands. OLIVIER stands in their midst, very much first
           amongst equals. One chair sits conspicuously unoccupied.
           DAME SYBIL THORNDIKE (74), severe-looking but kindly, very
           much the grand dame of the gathering, smiles cheerfully.
           RICHARD WATTIS leans over to her with a cheerful grin.

                          WATTIS
           What a wonderful adventure, Dame
           Sybil.

                          SYBIL THORNDIKE
           Such a lark! I long to see her.
           COLIN stands by the door. OLIVIER looks at his watch and
           shoots him a questioning glance.

           COLIN hurries along the corridor and stops outside
           Marilyn's dressing room. He knocks on it politely.

                          COLIN
           Miss Monroe?
           The door opens sharply and a small, bohemian looking woman
           in her 50s stands staring at him. This is PAULA STRASBERG.

                          COLIN (CONT'D)
           Sir Laurence sends his
           compliments. He's ready for the

                          READTHROUGH
           He glances beyond PAULA to where MARILYN sits by the
           mirror, her reflection framed in the lights. She wears
           little or no make-up. PAULA looks at him sharply.

                          PAULA
           But Marilyn is not ready. She's
           preparing.
           MARILYN glances up at COLIN in the mirror and smiles with
           unexpected simplicity.

                          MARILYN
           Excuse the horrible face.
           She finds her dark glasses on the dresser and puts them on.

           COLIN leads MARILYN and PAULA to the rehearsal room. He
           sneaks a glance at her. She has a vulnerable, lost
           expression. COLIN can't help staring at her until he
           notices PAULA looking at him and quickly glances away.

           The cast are all seated around the large table as COLIN
           leads MARILYN and PAULA onto the stage. Marilyn keeps her
           dark glasses on throughout. OLIVIER rises to greet her.

                          OLIVIER
           Marilyn, here you are, everyone
           is so excited to meet you...
           He gestures to the company.

                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
           Let us begin. Do sit down,
           please...
           SYBIL THORNDIKE looks sweetly at MARILYN from across the
           table and indicates the empty one at her side.

                          SYBIL THORNDIKE
           How lovely you are. Here, I kept a
           place for you.
           PAULA bursts forward, steering Marilyn away instead to an
           empty seat on the other side of the rectangle of tables. She
           looks at RICHARD WATTIS, the actor occupying the seat next to
           the empty one.

                          PAULA
           I have to be next to Marilyn!
           The startled WATTIS gets up graciously and troops all the way
           around the table to the seat next to SYBIL THORNDIKE.

                          PAULA
           She likes me by her side.

           What a good idea! I wish we could
           all bring a friend. One does get so
           terribly nervous. It's just like
           the first day at school, isn't it?

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 30.

                         
           She smiles kindly at MARILYN who smiles back tentatively from
           behind her dark glasses. He smiles with considerable charm as
           he makes his opening speech of welcome.

                          OLIVIER
           Welcome dear Marilyn, to our
           little fraternity. (Pause, looks
           around) We may seem a little
           strange and quaint to you at
           first, but I hope that in time
           you may come to find your method
           in our madness.
           Pleased with his over-contrived rhetorical flourish, he
           gives Paula a pointed look. She glowers back, obscurely
           sensing that she has been insulted in some way. MARILYN
           also looks up in confusion at Olivier's well intentioned
           but clumsy joke.
           Oblivious to her reaction, he opens his script with a
           sentimental flourish.

                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
           So. My very noble and approv'd
           good masters, let us now embark
           on our great voyage of discovery
           together. (Pause) With boldness
           and (we pray) good fortune, may
           we strive to create a work of art

           He is momentarily close to tears. WATTIS rolls his eyes
           discreetly, earning a grin from the actor PAUL HARDWICK.
           There is a rustle of pages and a few coughs, a mood of
           eager nervousness in the air as they all prepare for the
           reading.

           Page 10. PAULA turns the pages of MARILYN's script for her,
           as though helping a child to read. OLIVIER is in full flow,
           employing a heavy Mittel European accent.

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 31.

                         

           OLIVIER (AS REGENT)
           "Were you surprised to get my
           invitation?"
          MARILYN stares at him for a beat then reads haltingly.

           MARILYN (AS ELSIE)
           "I'll say I was surprised. I was
           so surprised I couldn't hardly
           think you meant me."

           OLIVIER (AS REGENT)
           "oh but of course I meant you. I
           had your name most carefully
           marked down on my programme. In
           matters of this kind I assure you
           I am most methodical. Who did you
           think I meant if not you?"
          MARILYN drops out of character with a sweet, nervous smile.

                          MARILYN
           Gee, Mister Sir, I could listen
           to your accent all day.
          There are private grins amongst the actors. OLIVIER smiles
          kindly.

                          OLIVIER
           You are amongst friends, my
           darling angel. Just plain Larry
           will suffice. (Pause) When you're
           ready..?
          Flustered, MARILYN looks at her script.

           MARILYN (AS ELSIE)
           "Well, Maisie Springfield...

           OLIVIER (AS REGENT)
           "Oh, no, no, no not Maisie
           Springfield, she's quite what I
           would call old hat...
          PAULA leans across, mounting a whispered running commentary
          in Marilyn's ear as OLIVIER speaks.

                          PAULA
           Remember why you're in the
           embassy, Marilyn. What does the
           Grand Duke want from Elsie? She
           thought there were going to be a
           lot of people here and it's just
           her.
          OLIVIER waits patiently.

                          OLIVIER
           It's your line, Marilyn.

          MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 31A.

                         

                          MARILYN
           Oh, let's see... "Oh, and am I
           what you'd call new hat?"

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 32.

                         
           OLIVIER tries to continue but is yet again brought up short
           by PAULA's passionate whispering.

                          PAULA
           Locate the experience, Marilyn.
           Look for the memory that helps
           you. Remember when you went to
           that party at Chaplin's house and
           you were the only guest? How did
           that make you feel?
           This time OLIVIER stares at PAULA.

                          OLIVIER
           It is only a readthrough, Paula.

                          PAULA
           Marilyn has to begin finding the
           character.

                          OLIVIER
           The character is on the page.

                          PAULA
           The words, maybe. Not the
           character.
           RICHARD WATTIS whispers to PAUL HARDWICK.

                          WATTIS
           She's half cut!
           DAME SYBIL THORNDIKE frowns with regal disapproval and
           smiles warmly at MARILYN.

                          SYBIL THORNDIKE
           Aren't we going to have fun?

           The readthrough over, OLIVIER rails quietly at MILTON while
           COLIN clears up the tea cups and plates used by the actors.

                          OLIVIER
           We can't have two fucking
           directors!

                          MILTON
           Marilyn wants Paula.

                          OLIVIER
           Why? She's got me!

                          MILTON
           Paula is costing us two and half
           thousand bucks a week. We might
           as well use her. (Pause) Listen
           Larry, accept Marilyn on her own
           terms and you'll be okay.

           OLIVIER stalks away. COLIN takes a chance and follows him.

           COLIN follows LUCY the WARDROBE GIRL down a rack of
           clothes. He is charming, glib and persistent.

                          COLIN
           Come out with me tonight.

                          LUCY
           I'm working.

                          COLIN
           Tomorrow night, then.

                          LUCY
           I'm washing my hair.

                          COLIN
           Your hair's lovely.
           She stops to look at him, attracted but cautious.

                          LUCY
           Look, I have two rules. One,
           never touch the talent...

                          COLIN
           Everyone has a lot of rules
           around here.

                          LUCY
           ... and two, never go out with
           thirds.

                          COLIN
           Why not?

                          LUCY
           Because they're all randy little
           buggers who just want some fun
           during shooting.

                          COLIN
           I'm not like that.
           She looks at him sceptically.

                          COLIN (CONT'D)

           First light over Pinewood Studios. Although it is August it
           is chilly so early in the morning. COLIN stands by the gate
           wearing only his thin summer jacket. He blows on his hands
           to keep warm. A black car appears. The window winds down
           and DAME SYBIL THORNDIKE pops her head out.

                          SYBIL THORNDIKE
           How kind of you to meet us. Dear
           me, you do look cold.

                          COLIN
           They're ready for you in make-up
           Dame Sybil.

                          SYBIL THORNDIKE
           How exciting! Don't you love the
           first day of a new production?

                          COLIN
           I don't know, Dame Sybil. I've
           never had one before.
           DAME SYBIL gazes at him with wistful sadness.

                          SYBIL THORNDIKE
           Oh, to be young again!
           She blows him a kiss and the car rolls in through the gate.
           Almost immediately OLIVIER's chauffeur driven Bentley
           appears.

                          OLIVIER

           has Miller. They're playing

           COLIN, ROGER and MILTON sit in silence, studiously avoiding
           each other's eyes. Somewhere upstairs bed springs creek
           under the pressure of enthusiastic love-making.
           The phone rings. MILTON nods to COLIN to pick it up. COLIN
           is glad of the distraction. We hear ORTON's irate tones on
           the end of the line.

                          ORTON

                          (ON PHONE)
           Well? What's happening?
           COLIN glances upstairs as he tries to think what to say.

           OLIVIER prowls the set smoking impatiently. COLIN is at his
           side with DAVID ORTON.

                          OLIVIER
           She's kept Dame Sybil Thorndike
           waiting in full costume for two
           hours. It's simply not fair.
           The door finally opens and MARILYN emerges, with PAULA on
           one side and MILTON on the other. In her figure-hugging
           shimmering white sheath of a dress she is ravishingly
           beautiful. Her hair is like a halo of light around her
           head. No one can take their eyes off her. Slowly, all work
           on the set stops. MARILYN walks to the set, acutely aware
           of the scrutiny of the crew.
           She smiles nervously, then suddenly hesitates, feeling the
           weight of everyone's attention. Anxiety flits across her
           face.
           She whispers something to PAULA and bolts back towards her
           dressing room. OLIVIER stares after her in shock.

                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)

           Right, Mr. Orton you wanted me to
           check the back projection. Please

           Isn't she pretty though?

           How kind of you, Colin. Yes, why
           don't we all sit down?
           Colin sees her chair by the camera and goes innocently to
           fetch it. But as he picks it up he is confronted by a stern
           looking crew member in overalls.

           What?

                          TREVOR
           That chair is a prop. Props are
           NATTKE. If ACT members are going
           to do NATTKE jobs, I'm calling my
           men out.
          Every eye is suddenly on Colin. Taking his shock for
          stubbornness TREVOR turns to the set and bellows.

                          TREVOR (CONT'D)
           Strike meeting!
          Half the crew immediately down tools. COLIN looks on in
          horror. SYBIL THORNDIKE frowns in reproach.

                          SYBIL THORNDIKE
           I'm sure we're all good union
           members here. There's no need to
           fall out over something so
           trivial.

                          TREVOR
           It might be trivial to you, Dame
           Sybil, but it's my livelihood.
           He's not in the union. (Pause, to
           Colin) Put the chair down.
          COLIN stares at him, frozen.

                          TREVOR (CONT'D)
           Put the chair down now!
          COLIN drops it as though it was on fire. It clatters to the
          stage. SYBIL THORNDIKE bears down on TREVOR majestically.

                          SYBIL THORNDIKE
           I rather think you've made your
           point. Solidarity is the
           important thing here. When unions
           fall out, it's only management
           that benefits.
          TREVOR pauses, not at all sure about this, but then shrugs
          magnanimously.

                          TREVOR

                          (TO COLIN)
           If I see you doing a NATTKE job
           again I'll close this set down
           quicker than you can blink.
          He turns to one of his men.

                          TREVOR (CONT'D)
           Dave, Dame Sybil needs a chair.

          inches and places it behind SYBIL THORNDIKE, who finally sits
          down, her sunny good humour instantly restored.

           all Bolsheviks then!
           She smiles nostalgically as ORTON appears to hustle COLIN
           away, muttering furiously.

                          ORTON
           Didn't they teach you anything at
           Eton? Now fuck off and see if you
           can get me a bacon sandwich
           without starting World War III.

           MARILYN is at last on set and ready to shoot. SYBIL
           THORNDIKE, as the Queen Dowager, waits behind a door.
           OLIVIER is in front of the camera with MARILYN, who
           flutters her hands nervously in an odd calming gesture.
           PAULA mutters a last few words in her ear, reading her
           lines to her from her small brown notebook.
           COLIN watches intently. A bell rings and the red light goes
           on. The camera operator, DENYS, rolls the camera.

           SYBIL THORNDIKE sweeps through the door right on cue, with
           MAUD, her lady-in-waiting, following. She is effortlessly
           in command of her lines.

           They all look at MARILYN... and nothing happens.

           Gee. I forgot my line. I'm sorry.

           That was perfect, Marilyn. You're
           Elsie to the life!
           MARILYN smiles awkwardly, not really believing her but
           SYBIL carries on with complete conviction.
           SYBIL THORNDIKE (cont'd)
           Perhaps we could practise our

           In fact Sybil is word perfect every time, and everyone

           She's impossible. I should have

           If anyone can make her great,
           it's you. You're a genius.

                          OLIVIER
           Oh, yes. The world's greatest
           living actor, so they say.
           OLIVIER looks at him, wanting to be reassured. He fumbles
           for a cigarette with shaking fingers and COLIN hurries to
           light it. He smiles wryly.

                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
           Let's hope I'm as brilliant as
           you think I am. (Pause) Now be a

          63 INT. PINEWOOD. DRESSING ROOMS/CORRIDOR. DAY. 63

           MARILYN and PAULA are heading for the dressing room.
           MARILYN looks tired and disconnected. COLIN is just behind
           them on another errand. He can't help overhearing Paula's
           insistent, honeyed tones as she responds to Marilyn's
           uncertainty.

                          MARILYN
           I just can't figure this movie out.

                          PAULA
           You were wonderful. You are the
           most gifted actress I have ever
           known. You were superb, Marilyn.
           You were divine.

                          MARILYN
           He was angry with me, I could
           tell.

                          PAULA
           You were great. You are a great,
           great actress. All my life I have
           prayed for a great actress I
           could help and guide.
           She stops abruptly and gets down on her knees in the
           corridor in front of Marilyn. COLIN stops awkwardly, his
           path blocked.

                          PAULA (CONT'D)
           Like this. I prayed to God on my
           knees. And he has given me you.
           You are that great actress,
           Marilyn.

                          MARILYN
           Come on, Paula, get up.

                          PAULA
           Not until you admit you were
           great.
           MARILYN smiles, her mood slowly lightening.

                          MARILYN
           Oh, okay. I guess I was.
           COLIN glances at her, seeing his chance to help.

                          COLIN
           You really were very good, Miss
           Monroe.
           MARILYN smiles vaguely. PAULA gives him a fierce look - COLIN
           moves past quickly.

          64 INT. CAFE DE PARIS. LONDON. NIGHT. 64

           The mood in the Club is cosmopolitan, lively but elegant.
           Rows of small tables are arranged around the stage, a few
           young couples are dancing to a jazz trio playing an
           exuberant, upbeat number. The music comes to an end and
           the couples return to their tables, COLIN and LUCY among
           them. There is champagne on the table, COLIN pours them
           both a glass.

                          LUCY
           Are you sure you can afford all
           this?

                          COLIN
           Oh, it's all right.

                          LUCY
           It must be costing a week's wages.

                          COLIN
           It's worth it.
           LUCY can't help being charmed.

                          LUCY
           You're not the average third, are
           you? Most of them would be happy
           with a swift half and a grope in
           the pub car park.

                          COLIN
           I'm not living off my parents, if
           that's what you mean. I want to
           make my own way, no matter what.

                          LUCY
           By making eyes at Vivien Leigh?

                          COLIN
           Who told you that?

                          LUCY
           Word gets around.

                          COLIN
           Vivien's a friend of my father's.

                          LUCY
           So there's nothing in it? You and
           Vivien?
           He smiles mysteriously and leans in to kiss her. She avoids
           him coolly.

                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           I'm not that easy.

           You'll be signing on your father's

          COLIN blushes violently.

                          COLIN
           Certainly not. I settle my own
           bills.
          The WAITER nods discreetly and leaves. LUCY looks at COLIN
          with a teasing smile.

                          COLIN
           I was always going to pay, you
           know.

                          LUCY
           Of course you were.
          He looks at her, but there is no hint of mockery in her smile
          and he is grateful.

                          LUCY
           Do you think Marilyn is beautiful?

                          COLIN
           Not compared to you.
          LUCY laughs, COLIN looks hurt.

                          LUCY
           You don't have to try so hard to be
           charming. You're nice enough as it
           is. Well, you could be.

           You know Marilyn's really still
           in love with Joe DiMaggio?

                          COLIN
           So they say.

                          LUCY
           She married Miller on the
           rebound. The papers are calling
           them "The Hourglass and the
           Egghead".

                          COLIN
           Which one is which?
           She bursts out laughing. Her eyes sparkle and she looks
           captivating in the glistening lights. He goes to kiss her
           and this time she doesn't stop him.

           Colin's Bristol is drawn up in a quiet suburban road lined
           with pleasant semi-detached houses. Lucy's house has a neat
           patch of front lawn, a stolid family car in the drive and
           net curtains in the windows. It is very little different
           from any of its neighbours.

           COLIN and LUCY are kissing in the small "best" parlour at the
           front of the house. It is spotlessly neat and clean.
           COLIN touches Lucy's breasts and then opens the buttons of
           her blouse. She puts her hand on his, stopping him.

           I really do like you, Lucy.
          She looks at him shrewdly.

                          LUCY
           Maybe.
          She hears heavy footsteps in the bedroom above.

                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           That's my dad.
          She gives Colin a swift peck on the cheek as she tidies
          herself. A moment later the door opens and Lucy's father, MR.
          ARMSTRONG comes in, wearing his dressing gown over pyjamas.
          He glances at COLIN with a suspicious smile as he looks at
          his daughter.

           MR. ARMSTRONG
           Time to be thinking about bed,
           darling. Early start tomorrow.

                          LUCY
           Sorry, Daddy. We were just going
           over tomorrow's schedule.
          COLIN and LUCY share a small, private smile. He takes his cue
          and stands up.

                          COLIN
           Yes, I should be off. Colin Clark.
           Pleased to meet you, Mr. Armstrong.
          He offers the surprised MR. ARMSTRONG a confident handshake.

                          COLIN (CONT'D)
           This is a very nice house you've
           got.

           MR. ARMSTRONG
           Do you know this part of the world?

                          COLIN

                          (THROWN)
           Umm... not really. My family are
           more country people.
          Lost for words they stare at each other for another moment
          before MR. ARMSTRONG smiles vaguely then goes. LUCY follows
          him with a smile at COLIN. He grins and whispers.

                          COLIN (CONT'D)
           Next Saturday?
          She nods. He follows her out into the hall.

           As he walks down the path, COLIN pauses. He looks around at
           the uniform semi-detached houses all around him. He is
           uncomfortable here, so far from the glamorous world of his
           parents or Pinewood studios. He has a strong sense that he
           and Lucy are from very different worlds, and walks to his car
           with an uneasy sense of relief to be getting away.

           COLIN is back on the early morning watch. A black car draws
           up and SYBIL THORNDIKE leans out.

                          SYBIL THORNDIKE
           Colin, dear, I thought you looked
           cold so I bought you this.
           She hands him a bright red woollen scarf. COLIN is touched.

                          COLIN
           Thank you, Dame Sybil.

                          SYBIL THORNDIKE
           Film sets and rehearsal rooms are
           the coldest places on earth.
           He smiles as her car drives away. He wraps the scarf around
           his neck and looks up and down the road again.

           The crew stand around in sullen discontent. OLIVIER paces
           back and forth with MILTON at his side.

                          OLIVIER
           She should be on time, like
           everyone else.

                          MILTON
           She is a star.

                          OLIVIER
           I'm a fucking star!
           He looks around in frustration.

                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
           If we nip this behaviour in the
           bud perhaps it won't be repeated.

                          MILTON
           This is Marilyn you're talking
           about.

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 47.

                         
           OLIVIER scowls at COLIN, who gives him a cigarette. MARILYN
           finally emerges with PAULA at her elbow. OLIVIER advances
           on her, his anger simmering.

                          OLIVIER
           Marilyn, darling you are an
           angel, and I kiss the hem of your
           garment, but why can't you get
           here on time for the love of
           fuck?

                          MARILYN
           Oh... you have that word in
           England too?
           She looks at him in surprise. She looks sedated, not quite
           there. PAULA leaps protectively to her defence.

                          PAULA
           Marilyn has to prepare properly.
           She has to find in herself all
           that lies under the surface.
           Acting isn't just a case of
           putting on a costume or some
           ludicrous false nose.
           OLIVIER gives her a freezing look then takes Marilyn's
           hand, leading her forward like a child.

                          OLIVIER
           You must apologise to Dame Sybil.
           MARILYN reddens with humiliation as he takes her arm.

           OLIVIER propels MARILYN towards SYBIL THORNDIKE. MARILYN
           reddens with humiliation.

                          MARILYN
           I'm sorry...

                          SYBIL THORNDIKE
           (Cutting her off)
           My dear, you mustn't concern
           yourself. A great actress like
           you has many other things on her
           mind.
           A radiant smile spreads slowly across Marilyn's face as the
           older woman's words sink in.

                          MARILYN
           You think I'm a great actress?

           None of the rest of us truly know
           how to act for the camera. But
           you do. It is a rare gift.
           She looks sharply at OLIVIER.
           SYBIL THORNDIKE (cont'd)
           This poor girl hasn't had your
           years of experience. She is in a
           strange country, acting a strange
           part. Now, are you helping or
           bullying?
           OLIVIER looks aghast at being so roundly rebuked. COLIN
           looks on, startled.

          69 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. VIEWING THEATRE. DAY. 69

           OLIVIER, MILTON, PERCEVAL, ORTON and the editor JACK HARRIS
           watch rushes. COLIN lurks about unnoticed at the back. They
           watch one of OLIVIER's speeches (from the " The Coconut
           Girl" sequence we saw filming in Scenes 61 and 62). He is
           dry and clipped, every take precise and professional. It is
           an effective but theatrical performance.
           MARILYN sneaks in with ARTHUR MILLER. They sit in the back
           row watching her performance from the same scene. She
           fluffs take after take, gets her words wrong and pauses,
           looking dazed. COLIN notices her clutching MILLER's hand
           tightly. But finally a good take comes up. She is charming
           and natural and her performance suddenly makes OLIVIER's
           look stiff and clumsy. MILLER smiles in relief and
           reassurance.

                          MILLER
           That one's pretty damn good. You
           knocked it out of the park.
           MARILYN glows at his praise.

                          MILTON
           When Marilyn gets it right you
           just don't want to look at anyone
           else.
           OLIVIER frowns. For all his greatness as an actor he will
           never be a film star like the maddeningly instinctive
           Marilyn. And the injustice of it is like a stab through his
           heart.
           At the back COLIN only has eyes for the screen. He watches
           MARILYN's image, enthralled. Until now he has taken Marilyn
           entirely at Olivier's valuation, but as he watches her on
           screen he begins to see things differently.

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 49.

                         
           He sneaks a look at her in real life. She is holding
           MILLER's hand tightly, looking tense and vulnerable as one
           disastrous take follows another.

           COLIN comes out of the viewing theatre behind OLIVIER and

           MILTON.

                          OLIVIER
           We've only been shooting for four
           days and we're already two weeks
           behind.
           COLIN can't resist blurting out a comment.

                          COLIN
           Why not only show her the good
           takes? Then she might feel better
           about herself.
           He looks self-conscious as they both turn to stare at him.

                          MILTON
           The kid's right. She could use
           the confidence.

                          OLIVIER
           I believe it's traditional for
           the producer of the film to watch
           rushes. Besides, she's an
           experienced actress. She should
           learn from her mistakes.

                          COLIN
           They just upset her.

                          OLIVIER
           Not half as much as they upset
           me.

                          ORTON
           I'll do that. You go and find
           Marilyn's script. She thinks she

           DAY.
           COLIN bursts into the dressing room without knocking.
           Clothes are strewn carelessly all over the floor. There are
           pill bottles, full and empty, on every surface, along with
           empty bottles of champagne and bunches of flowers. COLIN
           rummages around on the table, moving piles of scripts and
           books. No luck. He walks casually through the half-open
           door into the inner chamber.
           And stops dead in his tracks.
           MARILYN stands by a chair, a towel wrapped around her head.
           She is completely naked.
           She looks at him in astonishment.
           He stares back, equally astounded.
           He sees her script, heavily covered in handwritten notes,
           lying on the table next to an open bottle of champagne and
           a bottle of pills.

                          COLIN
           Your script...

                          MARILYN
           I found it.
           Calmly she takes the towel from her hair and wraps it
           around herself. She smiles quizzically.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           You can go now, Colin.
           He hesitates a beat, surprised that she knows his name,
           before he fumbles for the door.

           It's Saturday. Early closing. But

          She stops to window shop. MILTON lowers his voice to COLIN.

                          MILTON
           No one's recognised her.

                          COLIN
           At least she can shop in peace.

           Marilyn's a star. Stars don't
           even pee alone.
          He looks around anxiously. But then a PASSER-BY suddenly
          narrows his eyes and takes a second look. His face lights
          up and he shouts -

                          PASSER-BY
           It's Marilyn Monroe!
          MARILYN gives him a radiant smile and within seconds is
          surrounded by a crowd of SHOPPERS alerted by the fuss. A
          feverish excitement grows out of nothing as people come
          running to look, pushing and shoving to see.
          MARILYN is quickly hemmed in by the heaving mob. To begin
          with she enjoys it, smiling and posing happily for the
          cameras that appear out of nowhere. But as the crowd press
          towards something in the mood of the gathering changes; it
          becomes wild and over-excited mood as people scream
          Marilyn's name and shove bits of paper to sign in her face.
          A WOMAN is pushed to the ground and MARILYN is forced back
          against the shop window. COLIN sees a flicker of panic on
          her face.

                          ROGER
           My God, she'll be torn apart...

                          MILLER
           Get her out of here.
          COLIN and ROGER hurl themselves into the crowd doing what
          they can to keep the excited fans at bay.
          They manage to force a path to the car, drag the door open
          and bundle MARILYN and MILLER into the back. MARILYN is
          pinned against the door and COLIN has to put his arm around
          her shoulders as he helps her in. He hurls himself into the
          front, with Milton running alongside the moving car to dive
          in beside Marilyn.
          People run alongside, hammering wildly on the windows in
          violent hysteria.
          MILTON does his best to put a cheerful gloss on the chaos.

           As COLIN looks in the rear-view mirror he sees MILLER shaking
           his head in dazed horror as MARILYN slumps half-collapsed
           into the seat beside him.

                          MILLER
           Madness. Someone's going to get
           hurt.
           COLIN shifts his gaze to her in the mirror and his eyes
           meet Marilyn's. He sees - or imagines - a terrible sadness
           before she quickly replaces her dark glasses.

                          CUT TO:

                         

          77 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 77

           COLIN stands silently by the camera, watching MARILYN and
           RICHARD WATTIS, in character as Elsie Marina and
           Northbrook, open the doors of the Grand Duke's drawing
           room.

           MARILYN (AS ELSIE)
           "Well we're still the first ones,
           aren't we? Gee, this is all
           right, isn't it?
           OLIVIER looks out from behind the camera, patient and
           charming.

                          OLIVIER
           Cut. The line is "Gee, this is
           all right too, isn't it". It's a
           tiny word, my darling, but it
           matters. Let's go straight away.
           MARILYN smiles vaguely. HAIR and MAKE-UP rush to do last
           minute checks.

                          DENYS

                          DENYS
           Mark it.
           The clapperboard clatters down. Take two. WATTIS and
           MARILYN come in again on their cue.

           MARILYN (AS ELSIE)
           "Well we're still the first ones,
           aren't we? Gee, this is all
           right, isn't it?"

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 54.

                         

                          OLIVIER
           Cut. Nearly there, but Terry did
           work so very hard on this and we
           must try to get it right for him.
           Straight away, please.
          Take three.

           MARILYN (AS ELSIE)
           "Well, we're still the first
           ones, aren't we? Gee, this is...
           all right, isn't it?"
          By now there is a panic-stricken edge to her voice.

                          OLIVIER
           Cut.

                          MARILYN
           Can't we just drop it?

                          OLIVIER
           The point is that you have
           already admired the downstairs
           hall in an earlier scene. Now you
           are admiring this room as well.

                          MARILYN
           Oh, sure. (Pause, she looks
           stricken) Paula!
          OLIVIER looks startled. PAULA comes scurrying across.
          MARILYN appeals to her, turning away from OLIVIER.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           I don't get it. He's such a
           strange man. I think she'd figure
           out he only invited her to sleep
           with her.

                          PAULA

                          (TO OLIVIER)
           The reason Marilyn can't remember
           the line is because she doesn't
           believe the situation her character
           is in.
          OLIVIER takes out all his pent-up frustration on PAULA.

                          OLIVIER
           Then she should pretend to
           believe it.
          PAULA bristles at this insult to her husband's work.

                          PAULA
           Pretend? We're talking about the
           difference between the truth and
           artificial crap.

          MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 54A.

                         

                          OLIVIER
           We're in absolute agreement,
           Paula. Acting is all about
           sincerity. And if you can fake
           that, you're off to the races.
          PAULA only stares at him in disgust. Thoroughly alarmed,
          MILTON intervenes.

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 55.

                         

                          MILTON
           Maybe we should try for another
           take.

                          PAULA
           Marilyn needs time to give a
           great performance. You should
           give her as long as it takes.
           Chaplin took eight months to make
           a movie.

                          OLIVIER
           Eight months of this? I'd rather
           kill myself.
          Throughout all this MARILYN herself looks lost. COLIN
          watches her as she feels the crew's irritable collective
          gaze. Flustered, she flutters her hands in a calming
          gesture, then goes to the side of the set to lean on a bar
          put there for her to rest on (her costume is too tight to
          allow her to sit down). PAULA accompanies her. MARILYN
          looks up at her in anguish.

                          MARILYN
           I can't do this. I can't.
          PAULA looks at her adamantly.

                          PAULA
           You can do it. You can't fail.
           You will have more pain, you will
           suffer more but you will create.
           All you need is time.
          MARILYN looks at her, desperately wanting to believe it.

                          PAULA (CONT'D)
           Remember, Marilyn, a tree is
           never just a tree. What kind of
           tree is Elsie? An elm tree? A
           birch tree?

                          OLIVIER
           (Under his breath to

                          COLIN)
           God knows, but I'm a weeping
           fucking willow.

                          PAULA

                          (TO MARILYN)
           Think about the things you like,
           instead of him. Frank Sinatra.
           Coca Cola. Be specific. The
           character comes alive if you know
           what you're doing.
          MARILYN listens intently, a frown flitting across her face.
          She goes back to her mark. The whole crew is on
          tenterhooks.
          Camera running, speed, mark it... Action! Take four.

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 56.

                         

           MARILYN (AS ELSIE)
           "Well we're still the first ones,
           aren't we? Gee, this is all
           right, isn't it?"

                          OLIVIER
           Cut.
           A look of near-panic creeps into Marilyn's eyes at her
           inability to remember the line.

                          CUT TO:

          79 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 79

           The clapperboard snaps one final time. Take twenty three.
           MARILYN's smile is a grimace of terror. COLIN can hardly
           bear to look. Everyone holds their breath.

           MARILYN (AS ELSIE)
           "Well we're still the first ones,
           aren't we? (Pause) Gee, this is
           all right too, isn't it?"
           There is a stunned moment. WATTIS gapes and MARILYN looks
           around uncertainly. Did she say it? OLIVIER gestures
           frantically from behind the camera that she should carry
           on. She hesitates...
           ... there is an agonising beat...
           ... and then she panics and bolts for the side of the set.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           Paula!

                          OLIVIER
           Cut. What's the matter now?
           He takes her arm and whisks her away to the side of the
           set, lowering his voice, trying to conceal his exasperation
           with a honeyed tone.

                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
           Forgive me, Marilyn. This is my
           failure, not yours. Tell me how I
           can help you.

                          MARILYN
           I don't know who Elsie is. I
           can't act her if I don't know who
           she is!

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 57.

                         

                          OLIVIER
           Elsie is all in the script

                          MARILYN
           I can't find her. She's not
           there.

                          OLIVIER
           But you have her precisely, you
           know her inside out. I'm in awe of
           your gift. We all are.

                          MARILYN
           She's not real.

                          OLIVIER
           Why not simply rely on your natural
           talents?

                          MARILYN
           Are you saying I don't need to
           act?
          OLIVIER is bewildered by her inability to appreciate her
          own natural talent - as he sees it. He looks at her in
          genuine anguish.

                          OLIVIER
           Marilyn, you are the most
           attractive woman in the world.
           I'm simply suggesting you be
           yourself.

                          MARILYN

                          (SHOUTS)
           I don't want to be myself!
           (Pause) I want to be an actress
           playing a character.

                          OLIVIER
           (Trying to be helpful)
           All you have to do, dear Marilyn,
           is be sexy. Isn't that what you
           do?
          MARILYN flinches as though slapped. Tension ripples through
          the set. COLIN watches in dismay.

                          MARILYN
           I want Lee.

                          OLIVIER
           You've already got Paula, for
           heaven's sake. I'm the director.
           Speak to me.

                          PAULA
           I am only Lee's representative.

                          OLIVIER
           It's five in the morning in New
           York.

          MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 57A.

                         

                          MARILYN

           I WANT LEE!

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 58.

                         
           Her furious scream brings all activity to a halt. She storms
           off the set with PAULA following. The atmosphere is awful.

                         

          80 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. OLIVIER'S DRESSING ROOM. 80


           DAY.
           OLIVIER sits brooding savagely in front of his make-up
           mirror with MILTON GREENE. COLIN unobtrusively fetches
           whisky and cigarettes for them both as OLIVIER abruptly
           booms out to himself.

                          OLIVIER
           "O, now, for ever Farewell the
           tranquil mind/Farewell content/
           Farewell the plumed troop and the
           big wars/That make ambition
           virtue O, farewell/Farewell..."
           (Pause, exasperated) Paula's not
           an actress. She not a director,
           not a teacher. Her only talent is
           buttering up Marilyn.

                          MILTON
           It would be worse if she wasn't
           around.

                          OLIVIER
           You know what would make Marilyn
           Monroe a real actor? A season in
           rep. They wouldn't stand for this
           kind of nonsense at the
           Hippodrome in Eastbourne.

                          MILTON
           You have to be patient with her.

                          OLIVIER
           Trying to teach Marilyn how to
           act is like teaching Urdu to a
           badger.
           MILTON gives him a look but says nothing. Instead he picks
           up his bag and opens it. It is stuffed with bottles of
           pills. He takes one of them, checks the label and puts it
           in his pocket.

                          MILTON
           I better go see her. She'll need
           something to help her calm down.
           COLIN holds the door for him as he goes out.

                          OLIVIER
           (After a second)
           Pills to sleep, pills to wake up.
           Pills to calm her down, pills to
           give her energy. No wonder she's
           permanently ten feet underwater.

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 59.

                         
           COLIN looks at him tentatively.

                          COLIN
           Maybe she's scared.

                          OLIVIER
           We're all scared. It's part of
           being an actor.

                          COLIN
           But you have the training to deal
           with it.
           OLIVIER turns from the mirror to survey him.

                          OLIVIER
           I wouldn't buy the little girl
           lost act if I were you. Though
           heaven knows it's tempting.
           He sighs wistfully.

                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
           And I think Marilyn knows exactly
           what she's doing.
           COLIN isn't so sure but wisely holds his tongue.

                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
           You better get over to Parkside
           and make sure the poor girl's all
           right. (Pause) And Colin? Don't
           forget who you work for.

           COLIN draws up outside Marilyn's house. The place is dark
           and quiet.

           ROGER takes two bottles of beer from the well stocked
           drinks cabinet and hands one to COLIN, putting a coaster
           for him on the coffee table. COLIN looks around the opulent
           drawing room.

                          COLIN
           Are you sure they won't mind?

                          ROGER
           Help yourself. They can spare it.
           (Pause) Marilyn's okay. She's
           taken some pills and gone to bed.
           He frowns darkly.

           They like to keep her doped up.
           It makes her easier to control.

                          COLIN
           You mean Miller?

                          ROGER
           (Shakes his head)
           The others. They're terrified
           their cash cow will slip away.
           He smiles grimly and raises his beer bottle.

                          ROGER (CONT'D)
           Cheers!

           COLIN wakes abruptly from a doze as his empty bottle of
           beer rolls to the floor. ROGER is fast asleep. COLIN
           glances at the clock. It is nearly midnight.

                          CUT TO:

                         

          84 INT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. UPSTAIRS HALL. NIGHT. 84

           COLIN, a little drunk, creeps out of the toilet. The narrow
           strip of light from the door disappears, leaving the hall
           in darkness. COLIN inches forward uncertainly.
           He stops, waiting for his eyes to adjust. The house is
           totally silent. Then, just as he is about to move, he hears
           something.
           Breathing, very close by. Faint but unmistakable. Shallow
           breaths, like sighs.
           COLIN is paralysed.
           A beat, then -
           A door is flung open along the hall and light floods into
           the corridor.
           MARILYN is sitting on the carpet leaning against the wall
           only a few feet away from Colin. She is wrapped in a pink
           bed-cover and stares directly at him, her expression blank
           and sedated. By her side is an open spiral bound notebook,
           its pages closely crammed with handwriting.

                          MILLER

                          (OFF)
           Marilyn. Come back to bed. It's
           not what you think.

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 61.

                         
           She stares at COLIN. It is not even clear she knows he is
           there. COLIN gazes back at her, paralysed. MILLER's voice
           comes again, flat and tired.

                          MILLER (CONT'D)

                          (OFF)
           It's just a few ideas. Writer's
           stuff. (Pause) Bring back my book
           and let's get some sleep.
           Finally MARILYN stirs and closes the notebook. Holding it
           to her breast and clutching the cover around her shoulders
           she gets up and goes into the bedroom, closing the door.
           As the light snaps off COLIN breathes for the first time in
           what feels like minutes.

           COLIN, muffled in his scarf, looks up as Marilyn's car
           cruises to a halt at the gate.

                          COLIN
           Good morning, Miss Monroe.
           She is hunched in the back, her hair in a scarf, her face
           protected by her large sunglasses with PAULA by her side.
           She doesn't look up.

           OLIVIER, DAVID ORTON and COLIN huddle around the camera.
           JEREMY SPENSER and TECHNICIANS stand around, bored and
           listless. MILTON appears. They speak in low, urgent tones.

                          OLIVIER
           It's nearly lunch time.

                          MILTON
           She isn't feeling the part.

                          OLIVIER
           It's a light comedy. How much
           feeling can it possibly require?

                          MILTON
           Give her a few minutes...

                          OLIVIER
           She can't hide in her bloody
           dressing room all day.

                          MILTON
           Oh, yes she can.

           OLIVIER looks at him angrily. He is close to the end of his
           tether.

                          OLIVIER

                          (TO COLIN)

           DAY.
           COLIN knocks softly on the dressing room door. PAULA
           appears, opening it no more than a crack. She looks out
           suspiciously, sees it is Colin and turns back into the
           room.

                          PAULA
           It's Colin.
           COLIN waits a moment then PAULA opens the door wider.
           PAULA (CONT'D) (cont'd)
           Come in. Marilyn wants to see
           you.
           COLIN stares at her in surprise.

           DAY.
           COLIN comes in. The dressing room is in semi-darkness.
           PAULA settles down in the corner. MARILYN lies on a sofa,
           wearing a bathrobe, her face in shadow. Pill bottles are
           scattered across the dresser at her elbow. There is a long
           pause. She sighs softly.

                          MARILYN
           How old are you?

                          COLIN
           24. (Pause) Nearly

                          MARILYN
           You remind us of the young king in
           the movie. Kind of honest and
           innocent.

                          COLIN

                          (WOUNDED)
           I'm not innocent.
           She turns her head and her beautiful face comes fully into
           the light.

                          MARILYN
           What's your job on this picture?

                          COLIN
           I'm the third assistant director.
           Just a gopher really. Go for
           this, go for that...

                          MARILYN
           You're Larry's assistant too.
          He shrugs awkwardly.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           What were you doing in my house
           last night? Did he send you?

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 63.

                         
           COLIN hesitates. It seems pointless to deny it.

                          COLIN
           He was worried about you.

                          MARILYN
           Are you spying on me?

                          COLIN
           No! Of course not. Why would
           anyone spy on you?
           She sighs, and looks away.

                          COLIN (CONT'D)
           Are you all right, Miss Monroe?
           He waits hesitantly, but she seems to have drifted off. But
           then, suddenly, she turns back to him, her eyes huge.

                          MARILYN
           Colin? Whose side are you on?
           COLIN stares at her. She looks utterly beautiful and
           vulnerable in the shadowy light. There is only one answer
           anyone could give.

                          COLIN
           Yours, Miss Monroe.
           She rewards him with a brilliant smile, her whole face
           lighting up.

                          MARILYN
           Call me Marilyn.
           He is suddenly overwhelmed by a rush of sympathy. She looks
           so lost and vulnerable. Perhaps he means it. Perhaps he is
           on her side now.

           As COLIN walks down through the studio he meets RICHARD
           WATTIS with PAUL HARDWICK, on their way to wardrobe. WATTIS
           winks at him.

                          WATTIS
           Marilyn's got a new boyfriend.
           Larry will get jealous.

                          HARDWICK
           You can say that again.
           He gives a camp laugh. COLIN tries to shrug it off with a
           lightness he doesn't feel.

                          COLIN
           Nothing happened.

           You were in there for ten minutes
           at least. Plenty of time for a
           kiss and a cuddle.

           The mind boggles, dear.
           COLIN smiles but his expression freezes as he looks up to
           see LUCY nearby. She has heard every word of the exchange.

          90 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 90

           MARILYN is finally back on the set, filming a solo dance
           routine. Released from the need to remember any words she
           takes refuge in the physical activity, undulating sexily in
           her tight white dress in a performance which is gawky,
           mildly silly and charming all at the same time.
           The dance is deliberately a little amateurish. Elsie Marina
           isn't meant to be any sort of superstar. But she radiates
           joy and innocence and sheer happiness in the dance, and
           MARILYN captures all this perfectly. Within the scene the
           actor JEREMY SPENSER, playing Nicky, watches from the
           doorway.
           Everyone watches silently from behind the camera. No one
           can look away, least of all COLIN. It feels like one purely
           joyful moment in the agony the film has become, and Marilyn
           is radiant. Even OLIVIER has a reluctant half-smile on his
           face as he watches.

           The stage is empty except for OLIVIER and MILLER. They sit
           in a pool of light in the cavernous room. COLIN pours
           whisky for them and then steps back into the shadows. Both
           men ignore him. He is too unimportant to worry about.
           MILLER leans forward, holding his pipe but not smoking it.

                          MILLER
           I dreamed last night I could hear
           singing. And then I realised it
           wasn't a dream. There was a male
           voice choir serenading Marilyn
           under our window. At two in the
           morning. It's a circus. A freak
           show.
           OLIVIER smiles but MILLER looks dazed.

                          MILLER (CONT'D)
           I'm going back to New York for a
           few days. I need to see my kids.

           That won't help Marilyn.

                          MILLER
           (After a moment)
           I can't help her. (Pause) You
           know what she loves to do most?
           Sleep. It's what she lives for.
           Sleep is her demon.
          He pauses for a second.

                          MILLER (CONT'D)
           I've disappointed her.
          OLIVIER looks at him. MILLER shakes his head.

                          MILLER (CONT'D)
           She thought I could smash all her
           insecurities with one magical
           stroke. That I could make her a
           new person.
          He pauses for a second, weighing every word carefully.

                          MILLER (CONT'D)
           She wants me to protect her but I
           can't. I can't even protect
           myself. (Pause) She read some
           notes I made. They were nothing.
           Just a few ideas.

                          OLIVIER
           About her?
          He looks up and nods slowly.

                          MILLER
           She took them the wrong way.
          He leaves a long, uneasy pause.

                          OLIVIER
           But you do love her? Your new
           bride and all that?
          MILLER plays with his whisky.

                          MILLER
           I can't work. I can't think.
           (Pause) She's devouring me.
          Forgotten in the shadows, COLIN listens attentively to
          every word.

           Early morning. COLIN sees Olivier's black Bentley cruising
           towards the gate. VIVIEN LEIGH sits in the back seat.

                          VIVIEN
           Hello, Colin darling. You look
           like Horatio defending the

           VIVIEN is doing what amounts to a royal tour. She greets
           everyone, from the lowest chippie to the Heads of
           Department with the same flirtatious grace. OLIVIER walks
           at her elbow. The crew crowd around her. She is easy and
           relaxed, relishing every second of their attention.

                          VIVIEN
           I hope Larry isn't making you all
           work too hard. I know what a
           dreadful slave driver he can be.
           She sees ORTON and takes his hands.

                          VIVIEN (CONT'D)
           David, he would be lost without
           you.

                          ORTON
           Just doing my job.
           Tough as he is, he melts visibly. She moves on to JACK
           CARDIFF, the lighting cameraman, looking at him in mock
           misery.

                          VIVIEN
           I'm getting old, Jack. I need you
           to work your miracles on me.

                          CARDIFF
           You're more beautiful every year,
           Vivien.
           She laughs and turns to COLIN, looking at him severely.

                          VIVIEN
           Now, you are looking after Larry
           like I told you?

                          COLIN
           I'm doing my best...
           VIVIEN glances away to see MARILYN standing nearby, awkward
           and excluded. She has come straight from make-up and wears
           only a towelling robe, slippers and curlers in her hair.

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 67.

                         
           Compared to VIVIEN she looks frumpish. VIVIEN glides
           towards her, hands extended.

                          VIVIEN
           Darling Marilyn!
           She kisses her on both cheeks and holds her hands.

                          VIVIEN (CONT'D)
           Larry tells me you are quite,
           quite superb. I'm wild with
           jealousy.

                          MARILYN
           Oh, but everyone says you were a
           wonderful Elsie on stage.

                          VIVIEN
           But I'm too old to play her in
           the film. Larry was quite brutal
           about that. You see, the truth is
           all that matters to him. That's
           why we all admire him so very
           much.
           She glances at OLIVIER with a fluttering laugh. He smiles
           back with a haunted look in his eyes.

                          VIVIEN (CONT'D)
           Now, I must let you work. I only
           came to wish you good luck!
           Goodbye, everyone!
           The crew press around her. MARILYN watches, feeling more
           than ever the odd one out. COLIN watches her from the edge
           of the crowd. She cuts a lonely, vulnerable figure. He is
           totally preoccupied with her, so much so that when VIVIEN
           comes up behind him he turns guiltily as though caught out.
           VIVIEN stares at him. All her exuberance has vanished and
           she looks suddenly tired and older. It as though the facade
           of a beautiful building is beginning to crack. She gazes at
           him with bitter disappointment.

                          VIVIEN (CONT'D)
           Oh, Colin. Not you too.
           He wants to protest but VIVIEN is already turning away.

           And The Showgirl where a startlingly beautiful MARILYN, in
           gorgeous close-up, eats caviar and drinks champagne in a
           toast to the American President.

          OLIVIER and VIVIEN stand in the shadows of the projector
          beam. COLIN freezes in the doorway to the projection booth
          holding a pile of film cans. VIVIEN is crying abjectly.

                          VIVIEN
           I didn't think she would be so
           beautiful. She... shines on that
           screen.

                          OLIVIER
           You shouldn't upset yourself. You
           are ten times the actress she
           will ever be.

                          VIVIEN
           If you could see yourself. The
           way you watch her...

                          OLIVIER
           There's never been anything
           between Marilyn and me.
          She laughs hysterically.

                          VIVIEN
           Only because she didn't want you.

                          OLIVIER
           You're imagining things.

                          VIVIEN
           Do you think I'm a fool? You
           didn't think the little tart
           could resist the great Laurence
           Olivier.
          She looks at him venomously, a dangerous, unbalanced hatred
          seething in her expression.
           VIVIEN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
           But she saw through you, didn't she
           darling? Take away the actor and
           what's left of the man? You can't
           even play the husband properly
           without a script.
           (slaps him hard across the
           face. )
           I hope she makes your life hell!

                          OLIVIER
           Vivien..!
          She storms out. After a beat, COLIN tentatively enters.
          OLIVIER looks at COLIN in muted apology.

                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
           She hasn't been well. There was a
           baby... she... we... lost it...
           COLIN looks down awkwardly. OLIVIER sighs.

                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
           (After a pause)
           Do you have a cigarette, Colin?
           COLIN hurries to offer him one of his "Oliviers". OLIVIER
           grimaces wryly.

                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
           Not one of those awful things.
           COLIN finds a woodbine in his other pocket and gives it to
           OLIVIER, who lights it with a shaking hand. He inhales
           deeply.

                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
           Vivien's right... I did think I
           would fall shatteringly in love
           with Marilyn. What a joke.
           He looks at COLIN, his feelings raw and exposed.

                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
           Remember, boy, when it comes to
           women you are never too old for
           humiliation.

           The set is dressed and the crew are waiting but once again
           there is no sign of Marilyn. The actors, RICHARD WATTIS and
           PAUL HARDWICK amongst them, sit apathetically in full
           costume, while ORTON stands with his arms folded.
           Technicians chat or sit idly. As COLIN watches, OLIVIER
           looks across at MILTON who shrugs hopelessly.

           Marilyn won't shoot today. She's
           gone back to Parkside. She's
           upset about Arthur leaving
           England.

           He's only going to visit his

           You don't leave Marilyn alone.
           She can't handle it. She thinks
           everyone's going to abandon her.
          The phone rings. OLIVIER picks with a sudden burst of
          optimism.

                          OLIVIER
           Perhaps she's come back. (Into the
           phone) Yes?

                          ROGER

                          (OFF)
           Sir Laurence? It's Roger.

                          OLIVIER
           Oh, Roger. What's up?

                          ROGER

                          (OFF)
           Is Colin there, Sir?
          He frowns and looks at COLIN in bewilderment.

                          OLIVIER
           Yes, he's here. (Pause) It's for
           you.
          Puzzled, COLIN takes the phone as OLIVIER stares at him.

                          COLIN
           Roger?
          CUT TO PARKSIDE, where, to Colin's astonishment MARILYN comes
          on the line (Roger is not in shot).

                          MARILYN

                          (ON PHONE)
           Colin, why don't you drop by here
           on your way home?
          CUT BACK TO PINEWOOD - MILTON recognises Marilyn's voice
          instantly.

                          MILTON
           What the heck?

                          OLIVIER
           Why is Marilyn on the phone to my
           third fucking assistant?
          COLIN looks around helplessly.

                          COLIN
           Yes, I'm sure I can do that.
          CUT TO PARKSIDE. MARILYN smiles.

           Good. Don't tell anyone though.
          She hangs up.
          CUT TO PINEWOOD: COLIN replaces the phone in its cradle.
          MILTON and OLIVIER stare at him.

                          OLIVIER
           Well? What did she want?

                          COLIN
           She wants to see me.

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 71.

                         
           He shrugs awkwardly. MILTON looks at OLIVIER in panic.

                          MILTON
           He shouldn't be talking to her.
           He's just a kid. Supposing he
           says something? (Pause) Why the
           hell didn't she call me?
           His angry - and jealous - frustration is in stark contrast
           to OLIVIER, who looks at COLIN with a new interest,
           wondering if there is anything in this odd situation that
           can work to his advantage. He smiles calmly.

                          OLIVIER
           I'm sure Colin knows what he's
           doing. Don't you, Colin?
           There is a warning as well as approval in his tone.

           ROGER leads COLIN into the formal drawing room.

                          ROGER
           Miss Monroe said for you to wait.
           She won't be long.
           He looks at COLIN dubiously as he goes out. COLIN is
           nervous and not quite sure what to do with himself. He
           looks at the drinks in their decanters on the sideboard and
           is suddenly desperate for some Dutch courage. He finds the
           brandy and picks it up -

                          MARILYN

                          (OFF)
           Help yourself to a drink.
           COLIN wheels in surprise. MARILYN stands in the doorway,
           casually but beautifully dressed in silk trousers and a
           pale cream shirt. COLIN looks guiltily at the brandy.

                          COLIN
           I was just... checking you've got
           everything you need.
           She walks to the sideboard, standing only a few inches away
           from him. He can't take his eyes from hers. He drops his
           gaze, only to find himself staring at her breasts. He looks
           up again sharply but not before she notices. She takes the
           decanter from his hand.

                          MARILYN
           Here, let me.
           She pours some brandy into a glass and gives it to him.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           Are you frightened of me, Colin?

                          COLIN
           No.

                          MARILYN
           Good. Because I like you.
          Colin doesn't know what to say. MARILYN gazes at him.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           I want you to help me. Will you
           do that?
          She looks at him, her eyes wide. COLIN feels himself
          sinking into her gaze.

                          COLIN
           I'm only the third. Just a
           messenger, really.

                          MARILYN
           But you know what's going on. You
           can see both sides of the
           situation.
          He shrugs in helpless agreement.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           I want you to be honest. Tell me
           everything.
          She indicates a chair and COLIN perches on it awkwardly.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           Relax. I thought you weren't
           scared of me. (Pause) Are you
           hungry? I'll have them send in a
           tray. I'm starved.
          He doesn't know how to reply and Marilyn misreads his
          silence. Her eyes widen in dismay.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           Oh, gee, I'm sorry. Am I
           interrupting something? Maybe you
           have a Mrs. Colin waiting for you
           at home?

                          COLIN
           There's no Mrs. Colin.

                          MARILYN
           So we can talk as long as we
           like?
          He nods uncertainly. She frowns.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           Why is Sir Olivier so mean?
           He talks to me as if he's
           slumming.

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 73.

                         
          COLIN hesitates then decides to throw caution to the wind.

                          COLIN
           I'll tell you what's wrong. It's
           agony for him because he's a
           great actor who wants to be a
           film star, and agony for you
           because you're a film star who
           wants to be a great actress. And
           this film won't help either of
           you.
          He stops, breathless, knowing he has gone to far. She
          stares at him, wide-eyed with surprise. Horribly self-
          conscious he takes a too large swig of his brandy, reddens
          and coughs. She laughs.

                          MARILYN
           Are you sure you can handle that?
           You don't look old enough to
           drink.

                          COLIN
           I'm 23, Miss Monroe.

                          MARILYN
           It's Marilyn. (Pause) I'm 30. I
           guess that makes me an old lady
           to you.

                          COLIN
           Seven years is nothing.
          She smiles then sits opposite him.

                          MARILYN
           Do you know I've been married
           three times already? How did that
           happen?

                          COLIN
           You were just looking for the
           right man.

                          MARILYN
           They always look right at the
           start.
          She smiles wistfully. Her presence is overwhelming. The
          silence stretches for a second, pregnant with strange
          possibilities. Suddenly the phone rings, making him jump.
          Automatically he picks it up.

                          COLIN

           MILTON sits at his desk. He leans forward anxiously at the
           sound of Colin's voice.

                          COLIN
           Everything's fine. Miss Monroe
           just had... some large packages
           she needed handling...
           He looks at MARILYN's voluptuous figure. MARILYN looks back
           innocently and mouths the word "packages". She giggles. He
           turns crimson with the effort of trying to suppress his own
           laughter but MARILYN isn't helping. She teasingly makes
           shapes in the air of just how large the packages might be.
           He covers the phone, agonised, before they both collapse in
           irrepressible laughter. COLIN finally pulls himself
           together.

                          COLIN (CONT'D)
           Hello? Milton?

           giggles. He turns back to the phone, barely able to get the
           words out between snorts of laughter.

                          COLIN
           I'm sorry, Milton. I have to go.
           He hangs up quickly. They both laugh helplessly. MARILYN
           smiles.

           Let's walk in the garden. See if
           we can find any more reporters in
           the bushes.
           She giggles. COLIN's heart contracts as she casually takes
           his arm.

                         

          104 EXT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. GARDEN. DAY/DUSK. 104

           There is a golden glow on the horizon as the sun sinks.
           MARILYN, a cardigan around her shoulders, walks along the
           path. COLIN is at her side, acutely aware of her physical
           closeness.

                          MARILYN
           I didn't know it was so pretty
           out here.

                          COLIN
           You should get out more. See the
           sights.

                          MARILYN
           I am the sights.
           She giggles again, her mood lighter.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           Look at us. We're just like
           Elsie and the young King. What
           would Sir Laurence say if he
           could see us now?

                          COLIN
           I don't think he'd mind.

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 76.

                         
           MARILYN grows reflective. She takes COLIN's arm in a
           friendly way as they walk.

                          MARILYN
           I wanted to be an artist. To
           grow as an actor. I was so proud
           to be working with the great
           Olivier. (Pause) Now he thinks
           I'm the enemy.
           She looks at him innocently. COLIN hesitates.

                          COLIN
           He doesn't understand your kind
           of actor. He's hated the method
           ever since Vivien worked with
           Elia Kazan. It's all too new and
           strange. You're the future, and
           it frightens him.

                          MARILYN
           Every time I walk into the studio
           I feel this sense of doom come
           over me. He looks at me like
           he's smelling a pile of rotten
           fish. And the crew hate me.
           Paula is the only person I can
           trust. (Pause) Except for you
           now, maybe.
           She looks at him, her eyes huge. COLIN feels his senses
           swim as he stares into them...
           ... and then ROGER suddenly appears on the steps.

                          ROGER
           Phone call for you, Miss Monroe.
           It's Mr. Miller.
           MARILYN goes back up the path towards the house, glancing
           back briefly at Colin.

                          MARILYN
           Goodbye, Colin. Thanks for
           telling me the truth.
           COLIN stares after her. It is a second before he realises
           that ROGER is gazing at him sternly.

                          ROGER
           You'll be leaving now, I expect.

           DAY.
           The next morning. COLIN walks in as OLIVIER is talking to

           MILTON.

          MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 76A.

                         

                          OLIVIER
           I don't care if he fucks her
           sideways. Perhaps it'll calm her
           down. (Pause) Oh, hello, boy.
          He smiles cheerfully.

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 77.

                         

                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
           I hear you spent last night with
           Marilyn.

                          COLIN
           I didn't spend the night with
           her. We just had a chat.

                          MILTON
           I heard them chuckling.
          OLIVIER offers COLIN a lewdly suggestive grin.

                          OLIVIER
           Perhaps if Colin is very
           diplomatic Marilyn is more likely
           to behave herself.

                          COLIN
           She just wants a chum, that's
           all.

                          MILTON
           A chum? Jesus Christ, what is
           this, Goodbye Mr. Chips? Grow up,
           kid.
          He barges out of the room, slamming the door behind him.
          OLIVIER checks the effect of his Grand Duke in the mirror
          and sighs abruptly.

                          OLIVIER
           I thought working with Marilyn
           would make me feel young again.
           But I look dead in the rushes.
           Dead behind the eyes.
          He gazes at himself thoughtfully.

                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
           Perhaps I'm angry with her
           because in my heart I know my own
           career is in a terrible rut. I
           wanted to renew myself through
           her but all I see reflected in
           that magnificent face is my own
           inadequacy.
          He leans back.

                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
           You know, I admire Marilyn. I
           really do. Despite her behaviour.
           She has taken everything
           Hollywood can throw at her and
           triumphed.
          COLIN waits, uncertain why OLIVIER is confiding in him.

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 78.

                         

                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
           An actress has to be pretty tough
           to get even a tenth as far as she
           has.
           He glances up at COLIN in the mirror, shrewd and
           sympathetic.

                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
           But be careful, boy. She doesn't
           need to be rescued. Not really.

          106 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 106

           Gossip is always fast to travel but on a film it goes at
           the speed of light. As COLIN arrives on the set he is
           greeted with wolf whistles and jeers by RICHARD WATTIS,
           PAUL HARDWICK and the crew.

                          SOUNDMAN
           What was Marilyn like then, Col?

                          HARDWICK
           Going over her lines with her,
           were you?

                          SOUNDMAN
           Will she be in today or is she
           too tired?
           It is all good-natured stuff but COLIN feels strangely
           protective, not so much on his own behalf as Marilyn's.

                          COLIN
           She was just being friendly.

                          WATTIS
           I'll bet.
           There are hoots of laughter. COLIN retreats to a corner
           only to find RICHARD WATTIS pursuing him.

                          WATTIS (CONT'D)
           Ever heard of the Venus Fly Trap?
           There you are, Colin the innocent
           little fly buzzing about happily,
           when suddenly a heavenly scent
           attracts you and - Snap!

                          COLIN
           Oh, fuck off, Dickie. You've
           never slept with a woman in your
           life.

           one, love.

                         

          107 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 107

           A brief hiatus in filming. COLIN looks on uneasily as
           MARILYN, resting against her lean-to, has her costume
           attended to by LUCY.

                          ORTON
           Three minutes, ladies and gents.
           Three minutes.
           It has just dawned on COLIN that he has missed his date
           with LUCY. Before he can react he is jerked violently
           behind the scenery and pushed up against the wall by an
           angry MILTON.

                          MILTON
           Arthur Miller called me. He's not
           happy with you.

                          COLIN
           He doesn't even know who I am.

                          MILTON
           Marilyn must have said something.

                          COLIN
           Maybe she was trying to make him
           jealous...
           ORTON turns around frowning furiously at the voices behind
           the set. MILTON pushes COLIN off the set ahead of him.

                         

          108 EXT. STUDIO. DAY. 108

           MILTON turns bitterly on Colin as soon as they are outside
           the studio door.

                          MILTON
           Listen, kid, I've known Marilyn
           for seven years. I fell in love
           with her, just like you've done.
           COLIN is about to protest but MILTON ignores him.

                          MILTON (CONT'D)
           We had ten days together and that
           was it. She picked me up, she put
           me down. That's what she does.
           She breaks hearts. She'll break
           yours. My advice to you is to
           quit before you get burned.

                          COLIN
           I don't need your advice. And I'm
           not in love with her.

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 80.

                         

                          MILTON
           Okay, have it your way. (Pause)
           You don't see Marilyn again, you
           don't even talk to her. She is
           completely off-limits to you. Got
           it?

           COLIN hurries along the corridor, looking for LUCY, who he
           sees pushing a rack of clothes. He stops awkwardly. She
           gazes at him meaningfully, hurt and puzzled.

                          LUCY
           I waited for you on Friday.

                          COLIN
           Oh, God... I'm sorry... I forgot...
           I've just been so busy.

                          LUCY

                          (SHARP)
           So I hear.

                          COLIN

                          (SHRUGS)
           You know how crews gossip.
           There's nothing in it.

                          LUCY
           Of course there isn't. Marilyn
           Monroe fancying you? Come on.
           COLIN is put out. Up to now he has never fully confronted
           the possibility of Marilyn wanting him, but he doesn't like
           the idea being dismissed so lightly.
           Lucy sees it and her eyes widen in surprise and hurt.
           Before she can respond MARILYN herself coming towards them
           in her gown, her hair up in towel, surrounded by PAULA and
           her MAKE-UP people. She offers him a dazzling smile.

                          MARILYN
           Hi, Colin.
           COLIN smiles, self-conscious. MARILYN stops and frowns,
           looking at Lucy.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           Hey, are you guys dating? That's
           what I heard.
           She looks at him expectantly and suddenly his growing
           fantasy that she might actually be interested in him kicks
           in hard. He shrugs casually.

                          COLIN
           Of course not. You know how crews
           like to gossip.
           His voice trails off lamely as he realises he is repeating
           what he has just said to Lucy. MARILYN smiles.

                          MARILYN
           Too bad. You look cute together.
           She walks off with her retinue. There is a long pause.
           COLIN looks up to see LUCY staring at him in dismay. There
           are sudden tears in her eyes, which she wipes away angrily.

                          LUCY
           I thought you were different.

                          COLIN
           Lucy, I really like you. We've had
           such fun...

                          LUCY
           And now it's time to set your
           sights a little higher. I get it.
           (Pause) Who do you think you are,
           Cary Grant?
           She shoves the rack of clothes back towards the wardrobe
           department. Part of him knows he should go after her, but in
           the end he just stays where he is. He can't help feeling an
           unworthy sense of relief.

           COLIN crosses to the mean little bed on its iron frame and
           collapses on it gratefully. The noise of the rowdy pub floats
           up through the floorboards. He covers his ears with his hands
           then folds the pillow over his head in a desperate attempt to
           block it out.

           The studio is quiet at the weekend. COLIN walks along,
           snatching a moment for a cigarette. As he reaches the doors
           to the editing suites a battered old Wolsey draws up beside
           him. ROGER SMITH is at the wheel.

                          ROGER
           Get in.
           COLIN looks at him in confusion. The studio doors open and
           MILTON emerges. He glances darkly at COLIN and ROGER.

                          MILTON
           Any problem, Roger?

           Just dropped by to take Colin out
           to lunch.
          COLIN looks surprised. MILTON notices. COLIN stubs out his
          cigarette and hurries to the passenger door.

                          MILTON
           You're not taking him to Marilyn?
           That would drop us all in a whole
           ocean of shit.

                          ROGER
           Oh, no, sir.
          MILTON sees a bulky blanket on the back seat.

                          MILTON
           What do you have in there?

                          ROGER
           Just a picnic. We've been looking
           forward to it, haven't we, Colin?
          COLIN looks at him, bemused. He gets in quickly. MILTON
          frowns but shrugs and walks off with a wave.

                          MILTON
           Okay, well, have a nice time boys.
          Inside the car COLIN looks at ROGER.

                          COLIN
           Is she okay?
          In the same moment MARILYN herself erupts from under the
          blanket in the back.

                          MARILYN

           SURPRISE!

                          COLIN
           Oh, Jesus -
          She laughs, looking wonderfully naughty.

                          MARILYN
           Roger and I decided to take you out
           for an adventure. Didn't we Roger?

                          ROGER

                          (PAINED)
           Indeed we did.

                          COLIN
           Oh, God. If Milton sees me with
           you... I'll be sacked...
          He tries to scramble out but MARILYN hauls him back
          gleefully.

           No one can sack you, Colin. (Pause)
           Except me, of course.
           She pats the seat next to her.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           I don't like being on my own in the
           back.
           Before COLIN can respond he sees the curious MILTON running
           back, having spotted MARILYN in the back.

                          MILTON
           What the hell?
           He peers into the back window. MARILYN screams and buries
           herself back under the blanket. COLIN scrambles to get over
           into the back seat while ROGER stamps on the accelerator and
           the car roars off.

                          MILTON (CONT'D)

                          (SHOUTS)
           Colin! Get back here, you little
           bastard! You're fired! Do you hear
           me? Fired!
           COLIN winces. ROGER looks at him sympathetically. MARILYN
           emerges from under the blanket, tousled and laughing.

                          MARILYN
           Do you think he saw me?
           COLIN can't help laughing. He finally tumbles into the back
           seat with MARILYN as the car speeds away. She scoots up to
           make room for him.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           Snuggle up. This is fun.
           She threads her arm through his. He gazes down at their hands
           meshed together.
           ROGER's disapproval registers in the faintest flicker of his
           eyes.
           In the background the defeated and frustrated MILTON watches
           the car speed away.

          113 EXT. WINDSOR GREAT PARK. DAY. 113

           COLIN and MARILYN walk barefoot in the grass of Windsor
           Great Park while ROGER leans on the bonnet of the parked
           Wolsey, holding shoes, socks, and sandals.

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 84.

                         
           There is no one else around. The wind sighs and the grass
           is pleasantly warm underfoot. MARILYN turns her face up to
           the sun.

                          MARILYN
           This is how I ought to feel every
           day.
           COLIN smiles. Impulsively MARILYN hugs him.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           Let's run away together.
           He turns ashen.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)

                          (LAUGHS)
           Just kidding.
           She looks around happily. COLIN smiles at her.

                          COLIN
           We have today, anyway. One day to
           do whatever we like. We can go
           back to real life tomorrow.

                          MARILYN
           Only one day?

                          COLIN
           Well, maybe the weekend.

                          MARILYN
           Or a week?
           He grins. She takes his hand, walking contentedly at his
           side.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           What shall we do?

                          COLIN
           We could go to Windsor Castle, if
           you like.
           MARILYN's face breaks into a smile of pure delight.

           drive towards the castle.

          115 EXT. ROGER'S CAR. WINDSOR CASTLE. DAY. 115

           ROGER has parked up by the sentry post at the entrance to
           the castle. There are two uniformed POLICEMEN on duty.
           ROGER nods to the policemen, who instantly recognise one of
           their own.

                          ROGER
           Detective Chief Superintendant
           Smith. I'm escorting this lady
           and gentleman for the day. They'd
           like to look around the castle.
           As the policemen see MARILYN their eyes widen.

                          POLICEMAN
           Christ, is that..?
           He stares in disbelief. ROGER smiles.

                          ROGER
           Well, it's not Diana bloody Dors,
           is it?

                          POLICEMAN
           (After a second)
           Does she know anyone here, sir?
           We need to write down a contact
           name in the book.
           ROGER looks stumped at this. He turns to Marilyn.

                          ROGER
           You don't know Her Majesty, by
           any chance?

                          MARILYN
           We met at a movie premiere. She
           said my dress was pretty.

                          POLICEMAN
           I'm not sure that quite...

                          COLIN

                          (INTERRUPTING)
           My Godfather works here. He's the
           Royal librarian, Sir Owen
           Morshead.
           The POLICEMAN looks sceptically at Colin's casual clothes.

                          POLICEMAN
           Name?

                          COLIN
           Clark. Colin Clark.
           The POLICEMAN retreats into his box. We hear him talking on
           the telephone. ROGER looks at COLIN. He shrugs sheepishly.

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 86.

                         

                          COLIN (CONT'D)
           My father knows everybody.
           A moment later the policeman returns, looking surprised.

                          POLICEMAN
           He says to go straight up the
           hill, sir. You'll be met at the
           door.

           COLIN and MARILYN are led by a FOOTMAN down the long
           corridor. MARILYN looks awed by the ancient suits of armour
           standing regally along the way. COLIN watches her, enjoying
           her reaction.

           COLIN and MARILYN are led into another corridor, this one
           with a beautiful gold-leaf ceiling decoration. MARILYN looks
           up, enchanted.

          116 INT. WINDSOR CASTLE. ROYAL LIBRARY. DAY. 116

           The library is a series of magnificent rooms lined from
           floor to ceiling with books and prints. Every surface is
           covered with important documents - the place is a shrine to
           antique learning and culture. SIR OWEN MORSHEAD (63), the
           Queen's librarian, is a pleasantly eccentric figure with a
           sly wit. He greets COLIN with a friendly, distracted air.

                          MORSHEAD
           Colin, my boy! Come in, come in.
           Forgive the dust.
           He smiles at MARILYN, showing no sign whatever of
           recognising her.

                          MORSHEAD (CONT'D)
           You are pretty, my dear. I'm sure
           you and Colin have so much in
           common.
           MARILYN looks around in awe.

                          MARILYN
           Gee, I'd love to read all these
           books some time.

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 87.

                         

                          MORSHEAD
           Luckily one doesn't really have
           to. A lot of them just have
           pictures in.
          He finds a portfolio on the table and opens it.

                          MORSHEAD (CONT'D)
           These are by an artist called
           Holbein.
          MARILYN smiles at a portrait of a young woman.

                          MARILYN
           She's beautiful.

                          MORSHEAD
           She was the daughter of one of
           the King's courtiers, nearly 400
           years ago.

                          MARILYN
           I hope I look that good when I'm

           400.
          MORSHEAD laughs. He takes down another folder of drawings.

                          MORSHEAD
           And these are all by Leonardo Da
           Vinci.

                          MARILYN
           I've heard of him! Didn't he
           paint that lady with the funny
           smile?
          She looks at him, wide-eyed, playing up to her image as the
          dizzy blonde. In fact she knows exactly who Da Vinci is, and
          MORSHEAD is tactful enough to acknowledge it gracefully.

                          MORSHEAD
           The Mona Lisa.

                          MARILYN
           Do you have that one here too?

                          MORSHEAD
           Alas, that one got away.
          He closes the portfolio and takes MARILYN's arm briskly.

                          MORSHEAD (CONT'D)
           Now, let's go to the Queen's
           apartments. She's not here at the
           moment, but she will be sorry to
           have missed you.
          MARILYN looks at him, wide-eyed.

                          MARILYN
           Really?

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 88.

                         

                          MORSHEAD
           Oh, yes. Why, she was only saying
           to me the other day, "what must
           it be like to be the most famous
           woman on earth"?
           He shares a sly smile with COLIN. He knows exactly who
           Marilyn is and is enjoying every second of her company. He
           leads her out, with COLIN trailing in their wake.

                          MORSHEAD (CONT'D)
           Some of the rooms are very
           opulent but I think there's
           something you might like better
           than all that.

          118 INT. WINDSOR CASTLE. DOLLS' ROOM. DAY. 118

           OPEN on a massive dolls' house. Everything imaginable is
           inside - beds, chairs, baths, basins, even small rugs and
           chandeliers, all perfectly to scale. MARILYN kneels in
           front of it, gazing from room to room with childlike joy.
           It is so big she can lean inside and see the detail in
           every room. She cries out with joy.

                          MARILYN
           Look, Colin.
           COLIN kneels at her side.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           I sure never had a dolls' house
           like this when I was a kid.
           She sees a perfect doll family inside, husband, wife and
           two children. She points at them, her eyes shining.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           This is me, that's you, and these
           are our kids.
           She smiles wistfully and puts her hand on his arm.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           Our daughter's so pretty. All
           little girls should be told how
           pretty they are. They should grow
           up knowing how much their mother
           loves them.
           Her eyes fill with sadness for a moment.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           We look like such a happy family,
           don't we?

           She turns to him. They are only inches away from each
           other. COLIN's heart lurches. MORSHEAD coughs discreetly.

                          MORSHEAD
           You mustn't let me keep you. I'm
           sure you're longing to be on your
           way.

           COLIN and MARILYN emerge. A small crowd of POLICEMEN,
           SERVANTS and CASTLE WORKERS has gathered. There are cheers
           as they see her. COLIN looks nervously at MARILYN but she
           smiles and winks at him, mocking herself gently.

                          MARILYN
           Shall I be "her"?
           She jumps up onto a step and strikes a pose - hip out,
           shoulders back, bosom thrust forward, the classic Marilyn
           "look". The delighted crowd bursts into cheers. COLIN
           stands proudly nearby, content to watch Marilyn being a
           star, basking in the certain knowledge that she will be
           leaving with him. One of the spectators turns to him.

                          SPECTATOR

           COLIN stares at MARILYN. She catches his eye and smiles,
           just for him. He feels like he's tumbling into the abyss,
           but no longer cares.

           This isn't a school, it's a

           COLIN smiles.

                          COLIN
           Eton is 500 years old. It was
           founded by King Henry VI.

           Take that room up there.
          They stop as COLIN points up at a window.

           That's where the boys were sent
           if they didn't work hard enough.
           Where we were whipped.
          MARILYN looks at him in shock.

                          MARILYN
           Whipped?

                          COLIN
           Beaten.
          She looks appalled.

                          MARILYN
           I'd never send my kids away.
           (pause) How long were you here?

                          COLIN
           Five years. But I was sent to
           boarding school when I was eight.

                          MARILYN
           Why?

                          COLIN
           That's what we do in my family.
          She smiles at this, looking at him shrewdly.

                          MARILYN
           It seems to me that you've had most
           things pretty easy.

                          COLIN
           In one way, yes. But when you're
           brought up in a house of over-
           achievers, it's hard to make your
           own mark.
          She looks at him, sympathetic but pushing a little harder.

                          MARILYN
           So how are you going to do it?

                          COLIN
           Maybe it will be in films, but if
           not, there are so many
           possibilities out there.

                          MARILYN
           Sounds pretty good to me.
          She smiles warmly, liking him a lot more for his openness.
          We sense their relationship has moved quietly to a different
          and deeper level.
          But before either of them can say anything a SCHOOLBOY turns
          the corner in his Eton uniform.

           He looks up at MARILYN, his mouth hanging open in shock. Then
           he simply turns and runs, shouting at the top of his voice.

                          SCHOOLBOY
           Marilyn! It's Marilyn Monroe!

           MARILYN and COLIN are swamped in a joyous mass of Eton
           students. MARILYN smiles, waves, pouts, even kisses one boy
           on the cheek. Cheering BOYS hang out of every window.
           MARILYN blows kisses to them all. ROGER has to plunge into
           the crowd to rescue her. COLIN follows after them with
           difficulty. MARILYN pauses, jumping on a bench to wave
           goodbye and blow more kisses to the boys.

                          MARILYN
           Work hard, boys! I don't want
           anyone whipping you!
           A gawky young teenager near the front shouts out cheekily.

                          BOY
           You can whip me anytime, Marilyn!
           MARILYN laughs in delight. There are cheers as COLIN
           escorts her away.

           After the riotous excitement of the Eton schoolyard the
           peace and quiet of the river. MARILYN rushes along the
           sandy bank. The water glitters magically.

                          MARILYN
           Hurry up, slow poke.

                          COLIN
           But we haven't got any...
           He stops in mid-sentence as he sees MARILYN unbuttoning her
           blouse and throwing it off carelessly.

           He tears his eyes away from her as she casually strips her
           clothes off. He hurries to find a bush to get changed
           behind. As he ducks down behind it he hears a splash and
           MARILYN's cry of shock as she hits the water.

                          MARILYN
           Oh my gosh! It's freezing!

           MARILYN swims in the water, humming softly to herself.
           COLIN wades in, wincing at the cold. She laughs.

                          MARILYN
           This is great.

                          COLIN
           What if a boat goes past? We
           could be arrested.

                          MARILYN
           Don't worry. Roger will fix it.
           Oh, darn it...
           She holds her head and he looks at her with concern.

                          COLIN
           What's wrong?

                          MARILYN
           I have something in my eye.
           He swims across to her, very aware of her naked body under
           the water. She holds her head up to him.

                          COLIN
           I can't see anything.

                          MARILYN
           Get closer.
           She tips her head back. He looks deep into her eyes - and
           suddenly she grabs him and kisses him on the lips. Before
           he can respond she laughs playfully and swims away.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           That's the first time I've kissed
           anyone younger than me. There's a
           lot of older guys in Hollywood.
           She swims happily, totally relaxed. COLIN is much more self-
           conscious, keeping one nervous eye open for pleasure boats.
           Finally she swims back into the shallows and wades to the
           shore. She glances back, catching Colin looking. He glances
           away, embarrassed.

           Don't be shy, Colin. It's nothing
           you haven't seen before.
          COLIN wades awkwardly to the shore, trying to conceal his
          erection with his cupped hands. MARILYN giggles.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           Oh, Colin! And you an old
           Etonian!
          He grins. She reaches for her blouse and stands shivering
          as she tries to dry herself. COLIN goes to take her in his
          arms.

                          COLIN
           Let me warm you up.
          She snuggles into him gratefully, her teeth chattering. He
          rubs her naked back briskly, her thin blouse the only
          barrier between their bodies. Slowly his embrace becomes
          more sensual, his hands slowing, stroking rather than
          rubbing, his face buried in her hair, his arms pulling her

                         CLOSER -

                          MARILYN
           Don't spoil it.
          She looks at him, her expression knowing but sweet.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           I want this to be the perfect
           date.
          He tries to kiss her but she ducks her head away gently,
          her expression wistful.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           I haven't had a real date since I
           was 13 years old.
          She suddenly looks much younger, her smile a poignant echo
          of a lost childhood.
          He steps back politely, allowing her to put on her blouse.
          As she buttons it, she gazes at him, then impulsively leans
          forward to kiss him chastely on the lips. The kiss is as
          sweet and innocent as any 13 year old might wish.
          The kiss lasts for a few seconds, their lips touching
          gently, the river shimmering magically in the sunshine
          behind them. When they finally break apart she rewards him
          with a radiant smile.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           That was nice. I don't get kissed
           much.
          She looks wistful for a second but quickly brightens.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           Okay, what do we do now?
           COLIN looks at her, knowing it is time to return to the
           real world but reluctant to face it. There is a discreet
           cough and ROGER appears.

                          ROGER
           Time to go home, I think, Miss
           Monroe.
           She smiles, a little sadly, then gets up, walking past him
           as she puts on the rest of her clothes. ROGER averts his
           eyes respectfully and waits for COLIN. The two men look at
           each other for a second.

                          ROGER (CONT'D)
           Be careful not to get in too
           deep, son.
           COLIN knows he isn't talking about the river.

           MARILYN and COLIN sit in silence in the back of the car.
           Her exuberance has vanished and there is a distant look in
           her eye. COLIN wants to say something but can't think of
           the right words. He puts his hand on hers and she squeezes
           it, but then pulls away.

           A seething MILTON is waiting on the steps as ROGER parks
           the car. COLIN looks at him nervously. MARILYN looks at him
           then gets out, glancing at Milton indifferently.

                          MARILYN
           Hi Milton.
           She smiles sweetly.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           Next time I come on set, you
           better make sure Colin is there.
           He looks at her in shock then bitterly at COLIN.

           She waves briefly to Colin, nothing more than a flutter of
           her fingers. COLIN watches her all the way up the steps
           until she disappears inside.

           You spent the day with her. What
           frame of mind was she in?

                          COLIN
           She was fine.

                          (HUGE SELF-CONTROL)
           Well, find out what's going on.
           There's a good chap. Perhaps we
           can persuade her on this splendid
           day to do the work she's paying
           herself to do.
           He stalks off. COLIN sees WATTIS grinning at him.

                          COLIN
           Don't start, Dicky.

                          WATTIS
           You won't get any sympathy from
           me, dear. Frankly I wouldn't care
           if Marilyn dropped dead tomorrow.

           wonderful!
           COLIN doesn't laugh. WATTIS looks at him sympathetically.

           But she was wonderful yesterday.
          MILTON looks at him for a long moment, masking his
          hostility in barbed politeness.

                          MILTON
           I don't know what you did to her,
           kid, but she got nervous. I had
           to give her some pills to calm
           her down.

                          COLIN
           She doesn't need pills! She just
           needs someone to care for her.

                          MILTON
           Someone like you?
          COLIN reddens. MILTON shakes his head patronisingly.

                          COLIN
           I told you, I'm not in love with
           her!

                          MILTON
           You kissed her.

                          COLIN
           She said that?

           Spare me the bullshit. I know

          COLIN stares at him, feeling hopelessly out of his depth.

                          MILTON (CONT'D)
           You messed her up, kid. Confused
           her.
          He comes very close, his tone fierce but wounded.

                          MILTON (CONT'D)
           I've got every penny I ever made
           tied up in Marilyn. She owes me.
           If it wasn't for me she'd still
           be on contracts that make slave
           wages look good. I gave her back
           her freedom, and now Miller's
           turning her against me. That's
           what you get for trying to help
           Marilyn Monroe.
          He goes back to the house, pausing at the door, speaking
          more in sorrow than anger.

           and prop it up against the wall.

                          ROGER
           That's her window.
           He points with his torch. The window is open. COLIN shins
           up the ladder while ROGER holds it.

                          COLIN
           I'll open the door once I'm
           inside.

          133 INT. PARKSIDE. MARILYN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 133

           COLIN tumbles in through the window with a clattering
           thump.

                          COLIN
           Marilyn?
           A shaft of moonlight reveals MARILYN lying naked across the
           bed, her body partly covered by the sheet. Half empty pill
           and champagne bottles are scattered all over her dresser;
           there is also an old photograph in a silver frame of her
           mother Gladys.

                          COLIN (CONT'D)
           Marilyn?
           For a second he fears the worst, but then suddenly she
           groans and sits up, looking at him blearily.

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 98.

                         

                          MARILYN
           Oh hi, Colin.

                          COLIN
           Are you okay? Everyone was
           worried about you.

                          MARILYN
           Phooey.
           She pats the sheets at her side and settles down sleepily
           on the pillow.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           Get in.
           She is instantly back asleep. COLIN fumbles his way to the
           door. He searches for the key on the side table and quickly
           finds it. He goes to unlock the door, but then pauses,
           looking back at Marilyn. He puts the key back and bends
           down to whisper at the keyhole.

                          COLIN
           It's me. She's fine but I'm going
           to keep an eye on her. I'll sleep
           on the sofa.

                          (OFF)
           Come on, Colin, open up.

                          COLIN
           (After a second)
           I can't find the key. (Pause) You
           can all go to bed now.

                          PAULA

                          (OFF)
           Colin, open this door! She needs
           me...
           COLIN goes back to the bed and gazes at the sleeping
           Marilyn, his expression suffused with a tenderness we have
           never seen in him before. He pulls up the sheet so that it
           covers her nakedness, then tentatively lies down to rest
           his head on the pillow.

                          CUT TO:

           COLIN wakes with a jolt as the light snaps on, blinding
           him.

                          MARILYN
           Colin? What are you doing here?
           MARILYN sits up, the sheet clutched to her chest, her
           expression panicky and disoriented. COLIN hurls himself off
           the bed.

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 99.

                         

                          COLIN
           I came in through the window...
          He realises this doesn't sound reassuring.

                          COLIN (CONT'D)
           Milton thought you were sick.
          She stares at him in puzzlement then breaks into a dazed
          smile.

                          MARILYN
           The window? Is there a balcony,
           like in Romeo And Juliet? How
           romantic. (Pause) But I'm not
           sick. What makes them think that?
          She reaches instinctively for the pill container on her
          bedside table.

                          COLIN
           Please don't take any more pills.
          She frowns, clutching the pill bottle in one hand. He
          reaches out and prises it gently from her grasp. As he puts
          it back on the side he glances at the framed photograph.
           COLIN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
           Who's that?

                          MARILYN
           My mom.
          Her expression softens as she looks at the picture.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           They took her to the Sanatorium
           when I was a kid. I grew up in
           other people's homes, mostly.
          Alongside her mother's photo is another framed picture,
          this time of Abraham Lincoln. COLIN frowns.

                          COLIN
           Abraham Lincoln?

                          MARILYN
           I don't know who my father is so
           it might as well be him. Why not?
           I can pick any father I want.
          She smiles, then looks at Colin wistfully.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           Do you have a home, Colin? A real
           one?

                          COLIN
           Yes, I do.

          MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 100.

                         

                          MARILYN
           And a mother and father who still
           live together?

                          COLIN
           Yes.

                          MARILYN
           And do they love you?

                          COLIN
           I'm sure they do.
          He nods. She smiles sadly.

                          MARILYN
           You're lucky.
          Her eyes fill with tears. She looks up at him anxiously.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           Do you love me, Colin?
          He stares at her. She looks lovely but desperately
          vulnerable.

                          COLIN
           Yes.
          She reaches for the pills and pours three or four into her
          palm. COLIN gently takes her hand and takes two of them
          away. She smiles, not objecting as he settles her back
          gently on the pillow.

                          COLIN (CONT'D)
           But you and I come from different
           worlds. You're like some Greek
           Goddess to me...

                          MARILYN
           I'm not Greek.
          She smiles, teasing him. He smiles back. She takes his
          hand, looking at him in appeal.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           I don't want to be a Goddess. I
           just want to be loved like an
           ordinary girl.

                          COLIN
           Mr. Miller loves you.
          She stares at him, her face going blank with misery.

                          MARILYN
           I found his notebook. It said I'd
           let him down.

          MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 101.

                         

                          COLIN
           Writers scribble all kinds of
           things. It doesn't mean anything.
          She looks at him, her eyes full of pain.

                          MARILYN
           He wanted me to find it. It said
           he should never have married me.
           That I was unpredictable and a
           woman-child, flighty and self-
           centred. He's left me, Colin. Why
           do the people I love always leave
           me?
          She looks so wretched, so completely baffled, that COLIN
          responds with sudden passion.

                          COLIN
           I'll never leave you.
          She smiles and embraces him gratefully. She sighs.

                          MARILYN
           All people ever see is Marilyn
           Monroe. As soon as they realise
           I'm not her, they run.
          He lies down next to her, taking her awkwardly in his arms.
          She sighs sleepily.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           Boy, there's a lot of men in this
           business. And they all think
           you've got to sleep with them.
          She looks across at him, their faces inches apart.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           You're not like that. That's why
           I like you.
          COLIN stares back at her guiltily. She smiles.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           You should date that Wardrobe
           lady. She's pretty.

                          COLIN
           I don't want to. (Pause) I love
           you, Marilyn.
          She stares at him and tears gather in her eyes again. They
          stare intently at each other, their mood fragile, touched
          with both sensuality and a longing for something less
          tangible. MARILYN leans forward and kisses him gently. The
          embrace grows in passion and they kiss properly, hungrily.
          He kisses her eyes and her face and she sighs happily.
          He wants her more than he has wanted anything before.

          MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 102.

                         
          And then he stops. The fantasy he has been pursuing for
          weeks is within his grasp but he knows that whatever it
          does for him it will only damage her further. He pulls away
          from her gently. Her eyes flicker open lazily.

                          MARILYN
           What's the matter? Don't you want
           to make love?

                          COLIN
           Maybe we should just be friends.

                          MARILYN
           Okay. Friends.
          She wraps herself around him, curling up so their bodies
          cradle each other like spoons in a cutlery draw. As she
          buries her head in his neck he feels her breasts against
          his back. She curls against him.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           This is nice. Like spoons. I used
           to do this with Johnny.

                          COLIN
           Who's Johnny?

                          MARILYN
           Johnny Hyde. My agent, back in
           the old days. He was thin, like
           you...
          Her voice is blurred and drifting with sleep. With her body
          warm against him COLIN's resolve nearly snaps but he is
          clear eyed now and determined.

                          COLIN
           Marilyn?
          She mutters softly in reply.

                          COLIN (CONT'D)
           Do one thing for me? Come into
           the studio on time tomorrow and
           show everybody what you can do.
           Show Larry you're a great
           actress.

                          MARILYN

                          (BLURRED)
           Okay.
          He smiles and turns out the light.

           First light streams in through the curtains. COLIN wakes to
           hear Marilyn singing cheerfully. He gets up and sees her
           through the open door of the bathroom sitting in the bath,
           her back towards him. She is practicing the gentle waltz
           tune she is to sing in the film.

                          MARILYN
           "I found a dream and lay in your
           arms the whole night through...
           I'm yours no matter what others
           may say or do...
           She has never sounded so happy or carefree. COLIN smiles.

           COLIN races up the road and arrives panting at the gate a
           few seconds before OLIVIER's car swings into the entrance.
           The great man leans out of the back window.

                          OLIVIER
           Morning, boy. (Pause) Christ, you
           look rough.
           He looks at him thoughtfully, then shrugs.

                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
           Let me know when Marilyn arrives.
           If she ever does.

                          COLIN
           Oh, I'm pretty sure she'll be in
           this morning.
           OLIVIER gives COLIN an odd look.

           MARILYN, OLIVIER and WATTIS act a scene together; a drunken
           Elsie Marina is being seduced by the Grand Duke, and
           Northbrook bursts in to interrupt them as a VALET plays the
           violin in the doorway behind him.

           WATTIS (AS NORTHBROOK)
           "Your Grand Ducal Highness.."

           OLIVIER (AS REGENT)
           "This is intolerable"!

           WATTIS (AS NORTHBROOK)
           "With the deepest respect, sir,
           my message was so important I had
           no choice but to intrude".

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 104.

           "Revolution?"

           WATTIS (AS NORTHBROOK)
           "No, sir, Miss Marina's aunt has
           been in a motor accident. The
           hospital is calling for her most
           urgently."

           MARILYN (AS ELSIE)
           "What? (Giggles drunkenly) Oh, go
           away, you silly man."

           WATTIS (AS NORTHBROOK)
           "Miss Marina, your aunt... you
           realise how serious her condition
           is?"

           MARILYN (AS ELSIE)
           "Well, it's her own fault. She
           has no right being out at this
           time of night. She's 93!"
           MARILYN is utterly adorable. The crew, COLIN, amongst them,
           can't take their eyes off her. OLIVIER glances at ORTON
           behind the camera. They have a good take and they know it.

                          ORTON
           Cut it there!
           MARILYN is as happy as we have ever seen her. She seeks out
           COLIN amongst the crowd and beams at him. Half the crew,
           including OLIVIER, notice the look. COLIN blushes self-
           consciously but we can feel his pride.

           NIGHT.
           OLIVIER takes off his make-up. COLIN stands behind him with
           the end of day bottle of whisky. OLIVIER is in buoyant
           mood. It has been a good day.

                          OLIVIER
           Whatever it was you did to her,
           boy, keep doing it.
           OLIVIER grins slyly and COLIN doesn't bother to protest.
           The phone rings. OLIVIER picks it up.

                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
           Hello?
           His face falls as he listens to the voice at the other end
           of the line.

           COLIN paces nervously up and down the hall. PAULA appears.
           She looks at him for a long, unnerving moment then speaks
           with sudden ferocity.

                          PAULA
           From the first moment all I have
           felt is Olivier's loathing and
           contempt. He thinks I'm
           unnecessary. Me, her drama coach,
           surrogate mother, nursemaid. On
           call 24 hours a day to help her
           act, dole out pills, bolster her

           (Pause) Me. Unnecessary. (Pause) No
           me, no Marilyn.
           He is taken aback by her passion. She smiles bitterly then
           walks on. COLIN hesitates. She looks back briefly.

                          PAULA (CONT'D)
           You can come up now.

          140 INT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. MARILYN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 140

           MARILYN lies in bed with MILTON possessively at her side.
           COLIN comes in with PAULA. MARILYN looks at him dully, her
           eyes clouded and unfocused. A half empty pill bottle stands
           on the side. COLIN sits down next to her and she takes his
           hand, ignoring the surprised look on Milton's face.

                          MARILYN
           You think I can act, don't you,
           Colin?

                          COLIN
           Of course I do. You were
           wonderful today.
           PAULA looks at MILTON, then moves between them busily.

                          PAULA
           Marilyn's tired now.

                          MARILYN
           I want him to stay with me.

                          MILTON
           What would Arthur say if he knew
           Colin was here?
           A flicker of terror crosses MARILYN's face. COLIN turns on
           them angrily.

                          COLIN
           You heard what she said. She
           wants me here.

          MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 106.

                         
          MILTON looks at him grimly but finally surrenders the
          field. Paula is more reluctant to give in. She sits on the
          bed, stroking Marilyn's hand.

                          PAULA
           You have no idea of your position
           in the world, Marilyn. You are the
           greatest actress there's ever been.
           Not just actress. The greatest
           woman of this or any time. I love
           you like a daughter.
          COLIN is surprised to see tears in her eyes.

                          PAULA (CONT'D)
           It's hard now, but believe me you
           will survive this and go on to
           better things. Your life is ahead
           of you. You're young, just
           beginning.
          Paula's love and sincerity are obvious. She means it. COLIN
          watches her in silence. MARILYN squeezes her hand and PAULA
          gets up with a heavy sigh, bitterly reluctant to leave.
          Finally she drags herself out, leaving them alone.
          As the door closes MARILYN curls herself up in the bed.

                          MARILYN
           I'm so tired of feeling scared.
           Life is so shitty. I hate it. It
           hurts too much.
          COLIN looks at her, his heart breaking at her anguish.

                          COLIN
           I'm here now. I'll look after
           you.
          She gives him a wry look, teasing but thoughtful.

                          MARILYN
           Good old Colin. Looking after me,
           looking after Larry, looking after
           Vivien. Always putting everyone
           before yourself.
          There is an edge to this. He gazes at her, shaken, but she
          smiles and touches his face gently.
          He gets on the bed, fully clothed, to fold her in his arms.

           COLIN wakes with a start as he realises that MARILYN is
           screaming in pain.

                          MARILYN
           It hurts! It hurts, Colin!
           She is doubled up, clutching her stomach, sweating and
           frightened. COLIN sees a dark red stain on the sheets.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           The baby. I can't lose the baby.
           COLIN looks at her aghast.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           It's a surprise. For Arthur.
           Don't tell anyone. Promise me.
           He hurls himself off the bed and runs to the door.

           NIGHT.
           MILTON and COLIN wait by the bathroom in Marilyn's suite.
           ROGER hurries in.

                          ROGER
           The doctor's coming.
           COLIN turns the handle but the bathroom door is locked.

                          COLIN
           Marilyn, unlock the door.

                          MARILYN

                          (OFF)
           Don't let anyone in.

                          COLIN
           I won't.
           MILTON gives him a sharp look but he no longer cares about
           anything except Marilyn. There is a shuffling sound and the
           door is unlocked. At the same moment PAULA comes rushing
           in, hair awry, gown flapping, a wild look in her eye.

                          PAULA
           Marilyn! Marilyn, my baby, what
           has Colin done to you?

                          COLIN
           I haven't done anything. She's
           just... got a stomach ache.
           He reddens with embarrassment. ROGER coughs.

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 108.

                         

                          ROGER
           I think he means her monthlies.

                          PAULA
           What will Arthur say if she dies?

                          COLIN
           She's not dying, for Christ's
           sake.
           The HOUSEKEEPER now appears at the door with an elderly man
           at her side. He nods briskly.

                          CONNELL
           I'm Dr. Connell. Is the patient
           in there?

                          PAULA
           Please save her... it's Marilyn
           Monroe. You can't let her die.
           CONNELL calmly extracts himself from her grasp.

                          CONNELL
           Perhaps you'd all like to give us
           a little privacy?
           As COLIN shepherds the others out MILTON turns on him
           bitterly.

                          MILTON
           Happy now, kid?

           DR. CONNELL stands in the hall outside the bedroom writing
           out a prescription and smoking a cigarette. He tears the
           prescription off the pad and looks up.

                          CONNELL
           Who's in charge here?
           MILTON, PAULA, ROGER and COLIN all step forward as one.
           CONNELL gives them a wry look and shrugs.

                          CONNELL (CONT'D)
           I've given Mrs. Miller an
           injection and the bleeding has
           stopped. She needs to stay in bed
           tomorrow but after that she'll be
           fine. I suggest someone stays
           with her.
           PAULA leans forward and almost snatches the prescription
           from his hand.

                          PAULA
           She'll be safe with me.

           COLIN walks CONNELL to his car, their feet crunching on the
           gravel.

                          CONNELL
           Well, goodnight then.
           COLIN holds the door open as he gets in.

                          COLIN
           Was she really pregnant?

                          CONNELL
           I think that's a private matter
           between Mr and Mrs. Miller.
           He looks at COLIN with cool disapproval, then closes the
           door and drives off. COLIN stands watching, shivering in
           his shirtsleeves.

           COLIN creeps into the room and sits on the bed. MARILYN is
           awake. She gazes at him, hazy but lucid.

                          MARILYN
           We have to say goodbye now,
           Colin. Arthur's on his way back.
           When this film is over I'm going
           to settle down and be a good wife
           to him. I'm going to learn to
           make Matzo ball soup as good as
           his dad's.
           She smiles wistfully at the fantasy.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           We have to forget this ever
           happened.

                          COLIN
           I don't want to forget.
           He struggles then suddenly bursts out passionately.

                          COLIN (CONT'D)
           Let me protect you from all
           this...
           She smiles sadly.

           What do you want to do? Marry me?

                          COLIN
           Why not? You could come and live
           at my parents place. You'd love
           it. It's a castle, like in a
           fairy tale. We wouldn't even have
           to live together. You could have
           your own suite of rooms...
          He is close to tears, suddenly looking very young. She
          looks at him with a sad, sweet smile. He shakes his head
          stubbornly, taking her hand in passionate appeal.

                          COLIN (CONT'D)
           You could quit. Forget Marilyn
           Monroe, forget Hollywood. Let it
           all go.

                          MARILYN
           This is what I've worked for my
           whole life. I couldn't just give
           it all up.

                          COLIN
           Why not, when it drives you
           crazy?
          Her eyes widen in surprise. A flicker of nervous insecurity
          dulls her expression.

                          MARILYN
           You think I'm crazy?

                          COLIN
           I didn't mean that. I just meant
           you could be happy.

                          MARILYN
           I am happy. I got everything I
           ever dreamed about.
          She smiles tentatively, but he sees a terrible fear in her
          eyes. He looks down, realising with a cruel stab of pain
          that Olivier was right. There is no way back. She doesn't
          want to be rescued.
          He finally looks up, smiling despite the tears in his eyes.

                          COLIN
           Of course you're happy. (Pause)
           You're a star. The biggest star
           in the world.
          She smiles, reassured. He drags himself off the bed and
          goes to the door, pausing for a second as he looks back.

                          COLIN (CONT'D)
           You're right, Marilyn. We have to
           forget all this.

           From now on I'm nobody. Just the
           third. You don't even know I
           exist. We'll never look at each
           other again.
           She giggles with some of her old playfulness.

                          MARILYN
           Well, maybe just a wink. Once in
           a while.
           He smiles, looks at her just once more, and then goes out.
           As the door closes we see Marilyn's smile fade to be
           replaced by a bleak, frightened expression.

           OLIVIER sits in front of his make-up mirror in his Grand

           They're ready for you on set, Sir

           She's just arrived.

                          OLIVIER
           Only an hour late. Not bad by her
           standards.
           He smiles, then stands up, straightening his uniform.

                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)

           The crew are ready. The actors are on set. OLIVIER stands by
           the camera. COLIN is half-hidden in the shadows. There is a
           flurry of activity and MARILYN emerges, with PAULA on one
           side and MILTON on the other. She looks exactly as Marilyn
           should. With her white dress shimmering in the lights and her
           platinum blonde hair glowing, she has the air of a Goddess.
           She sweeps past only inches away from Colin but ignores him.
           He can't help feeling a stiletto sharp pang of regret.

          MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 111-

           112A.
          MARILYN turns to the assembled crew. A silence settles. She
          smiles around, blinking in the lights. She looks for comfort
          or support among the technicians but sees only blank faces or
          sullen hostility. She smiles nervously.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           I hope you will all forgive me. It
           wasn't altogether my fault. I have
           been ill.
          She smiles up at their uneasy expressions, struggling to
          understand herself and their expectations of her.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           I'd like you to remember I tried.
          This oddly moving and open confession is received in silence.
          No one quite knows how to react to her lacerating honesty.
          Perhaps they think it is just another performance.

          147A INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 147A

           OLIVIER, in character, lies back on a sofa, with MARILYN on
           top of him, singing the waltz that Colin first heard after
           his night with her. MARILYN looks kittenish and irresistible
           as she sings only a few inches from OLIVIER's face.

           MARILYN (AS ELSIE)
           "..I found a dream and lay in your
           arms the whole night through, I'm
           yours no matter what others may say
           or do. Be light of heart and fancy
           free, that's the way to start,
           there will be nothing to lose till
           you lose your heart.."
           She sings with touching delicacy, nailing it perfectly. There
           is pin drop silence on the set as the crew watch. COLIN is
           amongst them. It is a moment of almost unbearable poignancy
           for him. He suddenly realises that SYBIL THORNDIKE has crept
           up silently behind him to watch the scene. As he turns to her
           she smiles with infinite wisdom and compassion, murmuring
           softly so that only he can hear.

                          SYBIL THORNDIKE
           First love is such sweet despair,
           Colin.
           She touches his cheek gently and smiles, perhaps lost in a
           long ago memory of her own, before retreating quietly into
           the darkness at the back of the set.

           Inch by laborious inch The Sleeping Prince moves towards the
           finish line. We see a montage of scenes being filmed -
           - HARDWICK enters as Major Domo through the main door of the
           oval room, carrying a silver tray bearing shaving
           equipment...
           - WATTIS and JEREMY SPENSER crossing the drawing room to the
           Grand Duke's bedroom...
           - WATTIS crosses the drawing room and knocks on a door...
           The process is hardly any easier but somehow the work is
           done, until we come to the final shot in the sequence -

                          ORTON
           Very quiet, studio! Going for a
           take.
           The big overhead lights switch on with a series of heavy
           clunks.

                          DENYS
           Camera running! Speed!

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 113A.

                         

                          ORTON

           ACTION!
           MARILYN looks up, in character as Elsie, her eyes glowing.

           OLIVIER (AS REGENT)
           "My dear..."

           MARILYN (AS ELSIE)
           "I've got a solemn word of warning
           for you."

           OLIVIER (AS REGENT)
           "What's that, my beloved?"

           MARILYN (AS ELSIE)
           "You know what's going to happen?
           I'm going to fall in love with you,
           because I always, always do."
           CLOSE on MARILYN as she smiles, her face radiating joy and
           vitality.
           And then, in the split second before ORTON calls `cut',
           MARILYN turns her head just a fraction and winks at Colin. He
           grins. OLIVIER looks up from the sofa, notices and smiles
           indulgently.

                          ORTON
           Cut! Okay boys and girls, that's a
           wrap!
           There is a smattering of applause from the crew. MARILYN
           leaves the stage.

                         

          148A INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. CORRIDOR. DAY. 148A

           MARILYN walks away from us, down the long corridor, alone.

                         

          149 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 149

           The crew shake hands and clap each other on the back like a
           group of hardened war veterans. ORTON offers COLIN a
           grudging nod - `well done'. MILTON now comes forward,
           calling out above the hubbub.

                          MILTON
           If you'd all like to step this way,
           you'll find something I think
           you'll like.
           MILTON indicates a trestle table at one end of the studio,
           loaded with gaily wrapped parcels. He ushers the crew over.

                          MILTON (CONT'D)
           A parting gift to each of you from
           Marilyn. Men on the left, ladies on
           the right.

          MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 113B.

                         
          At first there is a buzz of excitement but then something odd
          happens. One of the crew simply picks up his present without
          looking at it and drops it in the large bin standing against
          the wall.
          There is a moment, then a WOMAN does the same with hers.
          Suddenly there is a rush for the bin as almost everyone dumps
          their present. The bin is soon overflowing.
          MILTON stares at the scene, then simply shrugs and walks out.
          ARTHUR JACOBS, utterly indifferent to the hostile
          undercurrent, grins and waves cheerfully.

                          JACOBS
           It's been a lot of fun, kids. See
           you at the Academy Awards.
          He goes out, grabbing a discarded bottle of booze from the
          dustbin as he goes.
          COLIN watches all this in shocked silence. He looks at the
          label on his own small parcel, which reads simply "To Colin,
          with thanks, Marilyn".

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 114.

          150A INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. WARDROBE DEPT. DAY. 150A

           The wardrobe department is empty except for LUCY, who
           cradles her own gift from Marilyn. COLIN comes in, looking
           nervous. They look at each other awkwardly.

                          COLIN
           Aren't you going to throw yours
           away?

                          LUCY
           Of course not. It's from Marilyn
           Monroe.
           He smiles. She shrugs and turns to leave.

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 115.

                         

                          COLIN
           (After a second)
           Lucy?
           She turns back to look at him.

                          COLIN (CONT'D)
           I was wondering if you're doing
           anything this Saturday.

                          LUCY
           I'm washing my hair.
           He nods, accepting this as no more than he deserves. She
           goes but then stops to look back at him.

                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           Did she break your heart?

                          COLIN
           (After a second)
           A little.

                          LUCY
           Good. It needed breaking.
           There is no malice in her response, just an awareness that
           he is older and wiser now, and perhaps a better man for the
           experience. He nods, accepting the rebuke.

                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           (After a second)
           I might be free on Wednesday.
           COLIN smiles. She goes out. He looks down at Marilyn's
           present in his hands.

                          CUT TO:

                         

          151 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. HALL. DAY. 151

           COLIN walks down the hall. He notices the red light is on
           outside the viewing theatre. As he goes towards it he sees
           ROGER coming the other way on his way out of the studio, his
           job done. The two men smile; an acknowledgment of everything
           they've been through together. ROGER offers him a friendly
           salute and then goes on his way.

                         

          152 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. VIEWING THEATRE. DAY. 152

           OLIVIER sits on his own, watching an edited version of the
           "The Coconut Girl" sequence (Scenes 61 and 62). COLIN comes
           in. OLIVIER glances at him.

                          OLIVIER
           "You do look, my son, in a moved
           sort/As if you were dismay'd: be
           cheerful, sir./Our revels now are
           ended.

                          (MORE)

          MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 116.

                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
           These our actors,/As I foretold
           you, were all spirits and/Are
           melted into air, into thin air...

                          COLIN
           Prospero.

                          OLIVIER

                          (SMILES)
           We are such stuff/As dreams are
           made on, and our little life/Is
           rounded with a sleep..."
          COLIN sits down next to the great man. They watch in
          silence as another sequence is projected for them. The
          sequence shows MARILYN improvising in the champagne and
          caviar scene. She serves herself food and drink before
          collapsing, drunk. The endless retakes and fluffs gone,
          what remains is a gifted comic performance by a luminous
          beauty.

                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
           (After a second)
           She's quite wonderful. No
           training, no craft, no guile,
           just pure instinct. Astonishing.
          He seems almost lost in awe. COLIN gazes at him in
          surprise.

                          COLIN
           You should tell her that.

                          OLIVIER
           Oh, I will. But she won't believe
           me. That's probably what makes
           her great. It's certainly what
           makes her so profoundly unhappy.
          He smiles wryly.

                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
           I tried my best to change her,
           but she remains brilliant despite
           me. (Pause) Directing a movie has
           to be just about the best job
           ever invented, but Marilyn has
           cured me of ever wanting to do it
           again.
          He signals to the projection box and the film stops as the
          lights come up.

                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
           And now I'm going back to the
           theatre. John Osborne is writing
           a piece for me.

                          COLIN
           I thought you hated all that
           Royal Court stuff.

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 117.

                         

                          OLIVIER

                          (SMILES)
           Miller made me see things
           differently. (Pause) You have to
           find new worlds to conquer, if
           you want to be the best. And
           believe me, most of the time, I
           really am the best.
           He goes to the door and pauses.

                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
           You've done a good job, boy.
           (Pause) Welcome to the circus.
           He goes out. COLIN looks back up at the projection box.

                          COLIN
           Run it again, please.
           The lights go down. MARILYN's face appears on the screen,
           laughing and happy. It is another sequence, the one where
           Marilyn does her sweet, uninhibited little dance (Scene
           90), a performance both sexy and yet touchingly innocent.
           HOLD on COLIN for a long moment, gazing at her image in the
           darkness, then -

                         

          152A INT. DOG AND DUCK PUB. DAY 152A

           The circus is leaving. The film is shutting down. Not knowing
           his next job COLIN sits, suitcase next to his chair, wearing
           the 'Marilyn' experience on his face and in his soul. Head
           down, sipping a pint. He could be a regular here.
           BARRY behind the bar, flitting around - the dart players and
           regulars at play.
           And then, as if a gust of wind invaded, BARRY looks up and
           freezes. The DART PLAYER, sensing something, turns to look up
           as well. The regulars are frozen in mid-action.
           COLIN is missing it all. 100% of his attention is given to
           his woe and his pint.

                          MARILYN
           Buy a girl a drink?
           COLIN doesn't turn. He recognizes the voice and smiles.

                          COLIN
           Can I get another one of those
           please, Barry?
           BARRY for once is silent, pours a pint. The regulars try not
           to stare.

                          MARILYN
           I didn't want to leave without
           saying goodbye.

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 117A.

                         
           MARILYN hands COLIN a package.

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           The first time you saw this, all I
           had on was the radio.
           Colin opens the package. It's her copy of the script. On the
           first page she has written a message scrawled in ink: TO THE

           MOST CHARMING THIRD ASSISTANT DIRECTOR IN THE WORLD

                          MARILYN (CONT'D)
           Don't forget me.

                          COLIN
           As if I could.

                          MARILYN
           Everyone else on the picture wishes
           they could.

                          COLIN
           Everyone else doesn't understand.
           She smiles, touched.

                          MARILYN
           Be a gentleman and walk me to my
           car?

                         

          152B EXT. DOG & DUCK PUB. DAY 152B

           The ever faithful Roger stands by the idling car. COLIN opens
           the car door for MARILYN.
           MARILYN beckons him closer. She kisses him gently. He smiles
           and says lightly:

                          COLIN
           What's that for?

                          MARILYN
           That's for being on my side; and
           remember, when you see me wink,
           that's for you.
           ROGER walks around the car and looks over at COLIN.

                          ROGER
           (glancing at COLIN)
           Looking a couple of inches taller
           than when I first saw you.
           ROGER nods at COLIN (a silent salute suggesting job well
           done.) He gets into the car and we stay on COLIN as he
           watches it pull away. BARRY comes to the doorway of the pub.

                          BARRY
           Was that really Marilyn Monroe?

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 117B.

                         

                          COLIN
           No - just a good friend of mine.
           BARRY walks back into the pub, leaving COLIN alone, staring
           at the vanishing car. And then the sun swallows it as it
           drives into the English countryside.

                          FADE TO:

                         

          153 EXT. WARDOUR STREET. LONDON. DAY. 153

           COLIN walks along chatting to friends. Dressed in a neat
           dark suit he looks older and more confident. There is
           little sign left of the callow young man who paced up and
           down the pavement outside Sir Laurence Olivier's office.
           We see the caption: SIX YEARS LATER.

                         

          154 INT. COLIN'S OFFICE. WARDOUR STREET. DAY. 154

           COLIN walks into a small office. Film cans are piled up all
           over the floor and books and papers spill off the shelves.
           A SECRETARY sits typing at her desk. COLIN goes to his own
           desk, glances at his diary, then looks up.

                          COLIN
           Any messages?
           THE SECRETARY pushes a piece of paper at him.

                          SECRETARY
           It's probably just someone having
           a joke.
           COLIN looks down at the message. There is a Los Angeles
           phone number and then the name - Marilyn Monroe.

                          COLIN
           (After a moment)
           Did she say anything?

           She just asked you to call.
           (Pause) It is a joke, isn't it?
           COLIN stares down at the paper.

                          COLIN
           Probably. (Pause) Book a call as
           soon as you can. Los Angeles,
           California. Brentwood 1890.

           It is late. COLIN stares at the number on the scrap of
           paper.
           The phone rings. He picks it up eagerly.

                          OPERATOR
           Your call to Los Angeles.
           We hear the crackle of the international line. He waits
           anxiously as the ringing continues.

           DAY.
           The room is large and tasteful - white sofas and cushions
           and deep rugs. Picture windows look out onto the Hollywood
           hills.
           A white phone rings on the table.
           It rings continuously, insistently.
           It carries on ringing.
           No one comes.
           HOLD on the jangling phone. Each time it rings we think
           Marilyn might appear, but she never does.
           It carries on ringing, unanswered, in the empty room. As
           the picture fades we hear like a ghostly lament the sweet
           echo of Marilyn's voice singing the Sleeping Prince Waltz.

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 119.

                         

                          MARILYN

                          (VO)
           "I found a dream and lay in your
           arms the whole night through, I'm
           yours no matter what others may
           say or do. Be light of heart and
           fancy free, that's the way to
           start, there will be nothing to
           lose till you lose your heart..."
           The fragile voice hangs in the air for a second, then slowly
           drifts away to nothing.

                         

          157 INT. COLIN'S OFFICE. WARDOUR STREET. NIGHT. 157

           COLIN sits with the phone to his ear. The sound of Marilyn
           singing the Sleeping Prince Waltz dies away and we realise
           has been revisiting it in his memory.
           He waits as long as he can but it is obvious no one is going
           to answer. In the end he puts the receiver back in its cradle
           in resignation.
           His gaze drifts up to a shelf stacked with film cans. He
           stands up and looks through them, blowing dust away; they
           have been here for a long time, ignored. He finds the one he
           is looking for - it says simply MM on the can.
           He takes the short reel of film and threads it through a
           Movieola in the corner of the room. He turns it on and bends
           to look.
           The screen bursts into life with an image of MARILYN at her
           most vital and captivating. It is a copy of some rushes from
           The Prince And The Showgirl, perhaps given to Colin by
           Olivier, or perhaps "borrowed" as a souvenir and long since
           forgotten.
           We see MARILYN dancing happily, exaggerating off camera,
           looking playful and sexy. She is radiant and full of life.
           After a moment she turns and looks off camera - perhaps to
           where Colin himself would have been standing - and winks
           happily.
           Blown up to the full size of the screen it is utterly sweet
           and charming.
           There is something so completely natural about the gesture
           COLIN feels he has been swept back seven years in time and
           MARILYN is standing in front of him again, in the flesh. It
           moves and delights him; perhaps he has never even really seen
           this clip before. At any rate he hasn't thought about it for
           years.
           It is MARILYN as he will always remember her, relaxed,
           affectionate and vital, a part of her, however tiny, forever
           his.
           She smiles, laughs at something, giggles in delight (without
           sound). She says something to an unseen crew member, then
           looks back, smiling at the camera.

          MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 120.

                         
          Her face fills the screen.
          Beautiful, timeless -
          Happy.
          HOLD on the image for as long as we dare, then -

           FADE TO BLACK.

                          THE END

1	CLOSE SHOT - SIGN

	Nashville Airport.

2	EXT. NASHVILLE AIRPORT - DAY

	TRICYCLE MAN drives into parking lot and parks next to GREEN'S 
	old Chevy. TRICYCLE MAM: locks his machine and walks toward 
	coffee shop. GREEN gets out of his car, locks it, starts in the 
	same direction. NORMAN parks the limo, goes into main building.

3	INT. AIRPORT - DAY

	NORMAN is attracted to large CONNIE WHITE display.

4	INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

	At the entrance is another "CONNIE WHITE" display and from the 
	jukebox we hear one of her songs.

	The waitress, SUELEEN, drops a fork, then gets another from an 
	overflowing sink and hands it to her customer, TRICYCLE MAN.

	There are several people at the counter with him, including 
	GREEN, who has just walked in. Another man enters, DELBERT 
	REESE. SUELEEN waits on all of them.

	A small black man comes out of the kitchen, carrying a tray full 
	or dishes. This is WADE.

					WADE
				(to SUELEEN)
			You want a ride into town?

					SUELEEN
			You bet.

	REESE looks up, checking out SUELEEN, then WADE, then the 
	TRICYCLE MAN, then his breast pocket to see it his wallet and 
	checkbook are still there, then he buries himself in his 
	newspaper.

					SUELEEN
			Got me an audition tonight.

					WADE
			Well, you just remember, if you 
			can't kick front, kick back, 'cause 
			at least you're kicking... Ten 
			minutes, okay?

	She nods and talks to the TRICYCLE MAN. REESE keeps sneaking 
	looks at her.

					SUELEEN
			I've just been waiting for the 
			right spot to sing in... I'm so 
			nervous...

	She laughs and starts to rinse the dishes in the sink.

					SUELEEN
			I'm good, though. There ain't but 
			one Sueleen Gay -- I don't mean to 
			be conceited, but really it's true. 
			I've been taking special coaching 
			lessons from Zeke Willard -- he's 
			just wonderful. Teaches you how to 
			phrase; that's really important. 
			And breathing. Well, you know all 
			about that. Anyway, I wrote this 
			song.

	She looks down and then begins to half whisper, sing, and half do 
	all of the gestures for a song she has written as she wipes some 
	glasses. The jukebox continues to play CONNIE WHITE, and every 
	time someone walks by, Sueleen stops. She finally gets through 
	the song and discovers REESE has been watching, too. She looks 
	away from him to the TRICYCLE MAN, who smiles. Be has finished 
	his meal.

					SUELEEN
			Oh, listen, I really do go on. 
			Here's your check. Sure has been 
			nice talking to you.

	As she removes her apron, a HAVEN HAMILTON song comes on the 
	jukebox, "Keep on a goin'."  The TRICYCLE MAN leaves.

	CUT TO:

5	INT. CONTROL BOOTH - NASHVILLE STUDIO - DAY

	We hear the last chorus or "Keep on a goin'" as sung by HAVEN, 
	who is recording.

	He is always dressed in white. In the booth are BUD and LADY 
	PEARL. Also present are two engineers and a producer. HAVEN is 
	accompanied by a long haired piano player with a white sweater. 
	HAVEN is not too happy with him. 

6	ANOTHER ANGLE

	OPAL enters the booth, carrying a too-large English tape 
	recorder. HAVEN Stops singing, mad at OPAL'S interruption and 
	the piano player. Through the glass we see him pantomiming 
	instructions for her to leave. As she does, HAVEN starts over.

7	INT. HALLWAY - DAY

	OPAL wanders to the next studio. BUD follows, apologizing.

					BUD
			Sorry. He sees a tape recorder and 
			gets upset.

	She looks at him.

					BUD
			He's my father.

					OPAL
			Haven Hamilton is your father? Can 
			you arrange an interview?

8	INT. SECOND RECORDING BOOTH - DAY

	They have entered a different control tooth. In the recording 
	portion, LINNEA and an all-black, male CHOIR sings a gospel song. 
	OPAL asks BUD who this group is.

9	INT. FIRST CONTROL BOOTH - DAY

	BUD returns. HAVEN has just exploded at the piano player and 
	starts to leave, yelling at the producer.

					HAVEN
			Who the hell is playing piano? Get 
			that hippie out of here... He's got 
			a tin ear. I asked for Pig, dammit. 
			I'm moving on 'cause I gotta get to 
			the airport. When you get my 
			backups straight, then we'll talk 
			about cutting this tune here.

	He heads for the hallway.

10	INT. HALLWAY - DAY

	It is jammed with black singers from the CHOIR. HAVEN hates 
	being crushed and moves through the congestion like a white 
	knight. OPAL moves near.

					OPAL
			Excuse me, sir. I'm here putting 
			together a film. I would like to 
			ask some questions.

	She has to fumble with the bulky tape machine and transformer.

					HAVEN
			Foreigner?

					OPAL
			I'm from BBC television.

					HAVEN
			Where the hell is that?

	HAVEN nod a politely and leaves the crowded hallway with BUD and 
	PEARL. He spots LINNEA.

					HAVEN
			Linnea.

					LINNEA
			How you doing, Haven?

					HAVEN
			oh, fine. Couldn't be better.

11	ANGLE T0WARD OUTSIDE

	They all say goodbye and HAVEN'S group gets into a new white jeep

	CUT TO:

12	EXT. AIRPORT - DAY

	Barbara Jean's plane taxis to a halt.

13	INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

	REESE leaves a tip and exits the coffee shop to greet the plane.

	Page Missing

14A	CONTINUED:

	TOM spots stews and goes to them

					TOM
			You ladies got room for a spare?

					STEW
			Sure.

14B	NEW ANGLE

	L.A. JOAN is left in the dust.

					L.A. JOAN
			'Bye... nice talking to you.

	GREEN sees his niece and walks over.

					GREEN
			Joan?

	She turns.

					L.A. JOAN
			Did you see who that was?

					GREEN
			Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, 
			too.

					L.A. JOAN 
			He is just wonderful.

					GREEN
			I'1l get your bag.

	CUT TO:

15	EXT. LANDING AREA - AIRPORT - DAY

	GLENN has just deposited a postcard in a mailbox and approaches a 
	gathering cluster of people. NORMAN and TRICYCLE MAN are nearby. 
	Everybody is waiting for BARBARA JEAN to appear. GLENN steps 
	close to NORMAN.

					GLENN
			Am I late?

					NORMAN
			Late!  Oh, Jesus!

	He runs off.

16	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As NORMAN runs toward passenger loading, we see HAVEN'S jeep 
	arrive with HAVEN, BUD and PEARL. It parks and all climb out. 
	REESE and TRIPLETTE approach the 'Barbara Jean' plane. BARNETT 
	is already on the runway, making arrangements. HAVEN'S group all 
	shake hands.

					HAVEN
			Delbert, how are you?

					REESE
			I'm fine. This here is John 
			Triplette. Triplette, like you to 
			meet the Honorary Mayor, Haven 
			Hamilton.

					HAVEN
			Good to meet you.
				 (turns to BUD)
			Bud, have them move the horses.

					TRIPLETTE
			Pleasure 

					REESE
			Where is she?

					HAVEN
			Still inside the plane posing for 
			pictures and signing autographs. 
			She's got a new album cut again. 
			She'll be down in a minute. But 
			she'll be late for the Opera if she 
			doesn't hurry. Bud, get the plane on 
			the walkie-talkie.

	BUD fumbles on his walkie-talkie telephone, but can't seem to get 
	anything.

					BUD
			They don't seem to be answering. 
			The ambulance boys are here, though. 
			Barnett always expects them to get 
			there like a shot. That thing only 
			goes a hundred fall bore with the 
			sirens going.

					HAVEN
			Thank you, Bud.

	BUD nods like he has been complimented.

17	ANGLE TOWARD PLANE

	A wave of noise begins from the fans. The band and majorettes 
	and horses and ropers go into a rendition of one of her hit tunes 
	as BARBARA JEAN appears. Everyone is breaking their neck to see, 
	especially GLENN. HAVEN and REESE give her the first round of 
	applause, then go back to talking. TRIPLETTE has never been 
	exposed to anything quite like this before and stands a little in 
	awe of the situation.

	When the twirling and tricking and music stop, BARBARA JEAN 
	descends the stairs.

					HAVEN
			Bud, tell them to move the horses. 
			Promised this strip would be spic 
			and span.

	He smiles and winks.

					REESE
			Listen, we'll go get the car and 
			come back. This'l1 be going on for 
			a while.

					HAVEN
			You bet. She's probably talking to 
			somebody about their sick child. You 
			know how she is.

	They wave goodbye and head in the direction of the loading zone. 
	Behind them, the horse people disperse and get into their cars 
	and horse trailers, preparing to return to Nashville.

18	ANOTHER ANGLE

	BARNETT comes over to REESE, TRIPLETTE, HAVEN, BUD and PEARL 
	while BARBARA JEAN continues to greet fans.

19	EXT. AIRPORT NEAR PARKING LOT - DAY

	While the BARBARA JEAN arrival takes place on the runway NORMAN 
	finds BILL and MARY. NORMAN speaks softly and out of breath, 
	trying to pretend he's on time.

					NORMAN
			Hi.

	BILL slaps him on the back and engulfs him.

					BILL
			Hi, Norman.

	NORMAN looks relieved. BILL and MARY have been arguing.

					NORMAN
			Sure is nice to see you all again. 
			I never thought I'd see you again 
			after the last time.

					BILL
			Oh, Norman, you worry too much.

	MARY takes NORMAN'S hand.

					MARY
			Norman, how are you?

	She kisses him and he blushes. BILL and MARY are glad to talk to 
	someone else.

					NORMAN
			Fine. Just fine.

	As they walk to the limo, we see a car with loudspeakers on top 
	of it and clearly written door signs that read: "Replacement 
	Party" in red, white and blue. REESE and TILIPLETTE are walking 
	toward it, shaking hands with several people.

					NORMAN
			Sure have missed you all, though. 
			Oh, where's Tom?  Isn't he with you?

					BILL
			Don't worry about old Tom.

20	ANOTHER ANGLE

	TOM and the stews walk to a VW with a sun roof.

	Nearby REESE and TRIPLETTE get into their Cadillac, behind it the 
	Replacement Party car. Coming from the loudspeakers a tape-
	recorded VOICE:

					VOICE
			Have you thought about your future 
			and what America needs to examine...

	Behind the Replacement Party car is an airport bus with "Connie 
	White" posters on the side. GLENN is one or the passengers. He 
	cranes his neck to continue watching the runway and BARBARA JEAN.

21	EXT. PARKING LOT

	NORMAN'S limo, with BILL and MARY, follows traffic as the 
	TRICYCLE MAN fires up his machine. WADE'S car with SUELEEN also 
	joins the procession.

22	ANGLE TOWARD RUNWAY

	The orange ambulance has moved into the area near the plane and 
	there seems to be a great deal at activity.

	REESE and TRIPLETTE'S car stops, and they rush out and run into 
	HAVEN, who is shouting for people to get the hell out of the way.

23	NEW ANGLE

	Two ambulance ATTENDANTS cut through the crowd. HAVEN, TRIPLETTE 
	and REESE rush near. BARNETT is on his knees over BARBARA JEAN, 
	who has collapsed. The ATTENDANTS lean over her with ammonia. 
	They test her reflexes, etc..

					ATTENDANT
			How long was she out?

					BARNETT
			Not too long. But she keeps 
			passing out.

	She comes to and looks at them all.

					BARBARA JEAN
				 (oblivious)
			Just give your manna that vitamin 
			E. Makes a world of difference.

					HAVEN
			Here she is again.

	She resists the ammonia, looks around and passes out again.

					ATTENDANT
			Okay, let's get her to the wagon.

	A stretcher is brought in and she is placed under oxygen. BARNETT 
	climbs into the ambulance with BARBARA JEAN, slamming the door on 
	DELBERT and TRIPLETTE. HAVEN stands there, yelling at people. 
	DELBERT and TRIPLETTE rush back to their car as the ambulance 
	speeds off, siren wailing.

	CUT TO:

24	EXT. FREEVAY TO NASHVILLE - DAY

25	TRICYCLE MAN

	leads the procession.

26	INT. GREEN'S CAR

					GREEN
			Eater's been asking for you.

	L.A. JOAN is trying to find a station she likes on her transistor 
	radio.

					L.A. JOAN
			Uh huh.

					GREEN
			She's been in the hospital two 
			weeks yesterday.

	L.A. JOAN can't find anything she likes. 

					L.A. JOAN
			You know anything about the 
			stations here?

					GREEN
				 (hasn't heard) 
			It's hard to say. Doctors thought 
			she'd come home a week ago. All it 
			was was appendix.

					L.A. JOAN
			All they got is advertisements. 
			Just like L.A.

					GREEN
			Did an exploratory and according to 
			them, she needed an overhaul.

	He chuckles at his prepared joke.

					L.A. JOAN
			Well, I could use one, especially 
			if I'm pregnant.

					GREEN
			What did you say?

					L.A. JOAN
			I said, maybe I'll change my name 
			again.

					GREEN
			I see... Well, those doctors are 
			real miracle workers.

					L.A. JOAN
			But not unless Nashville really 
			inspires me.

					GREEN
			Maybe you can look after me a 
			little.

					L.A. JOAN
			That Tom sure is cute.

29	INT. HAVEN'S JEEP

					PEARL
			We had these two city boys come in 
			last week. One or them said his 
			Ford truck had cut off his foot. 
			The other one said that wasn't true. 
			Then the first said he looked just 
			like Eddie Black when he said 
			that...

					HAVEN
			Bud, would you be sure to get the 
			oil changed?

					BUD
			Ya... where do you want me to take 
			it?

					PEARL
			Do you remember Eddie Black? He had 
			those blue eyes.

					HAVEN
			Where you always take it. There's 
			nothing special about this time.

					PEARL
			And they started pounding on each 
			other. But the one without the foot 
			was strongest.

					HAVEN
			Bud, you're going to have to show 
			up at the hospital tar me I gotta 
			get back to that session.

					BUD
			Okay. Anything you want me to say?

					HAVEN
			Say I had to get back to the 
			session. ~ God -- All school did 
			for you, you can put in a thimble.

					PEARL
			The cops came through and broke it 
			up. I finally just had to call Chet 
			and say, 'Chet, get over here. There 
			are two old bays here breaking up 
			the furniture...'

30	INT. WADE'S CAR-TRUCK

	SUELEEN in doing some vocal exercising. WADE listens for awhile.

					WADE
			Is that what you're going to sing?

	She laughs.

					SUELEEN
			No -- That's exercises. My coach 
			says you have to do exercise because 
			the vocal chords are muscle and need 
			to be stretched. Every time you 
			stretch them, the middle part sets 
			stronger. That's the place where I 
			sing.

					WADE
			You think I got any kind of a 
			voice?

	He breaks into a scale.

					SUELEEN
			You sure do it loud.

					WADE
			Is that good?

					SUELEEN
			It's not bad.

					WADE
			You think I should take lessons?

					SUELEEN
			If you're serious. Being serious 
			is real important.

					WADE
			You serious?

					SUELEEN
			Wade -- I've been working toward 
			this audition for years.

					WADE
			Well, honey, I sure hope it comes 
			your way then.

			You think it will?

					WADE
			Sure thing.

					STEW #3
			Really?

					TOM
			Me, too.

	They all laugh. STEW #4 has been driving over-cautiously because 
	of the cargo. TOM leans over and kisses her ear.

					TOM
			You having any fun?

	She shrieks and practically drives off the road. They all laugh.

					TOM
			That's the most important thing --
			to have -- fun 

					STEW #2
			How long are you going to be here?

					TOM
			Long enough to have fun.

	They laugh.

					TRIPLETTE
			You go to school together?

					REESE
			No, we never did that

					TRIPLETTE
			Oh --

					REESE
			We're connected by a relative. One 
			time, one of his aunts married one 
			of my uncles. That was a long time 
			ago, though. How'd you come to work 
			for him?

					TRIPLETTE
			Well, I really think he's got a 
			chance. 

					REESE
			You do?

					TRIPLETTE
			Oh yea -- There has never been a 
			better time for something new.

					REESE
			He ain't really new.

					TRIPLETTE
			He is to a lot of people.

					REESE
			He was a good Judge, but that was a 
			long time ago.

					TRIPLETTE
			You know, I'll bet you he makes it 
			with a majority.

					REESE
			Where are you from?

					TRIPLETTE
			Southern California.

					REESE
			You always live there?

					TRIPLETTE
			Spent time in Arizona. Why?

					REESE
			Well, I admire your optimism, and I 
			just wondered if it was regional. 
			You ever see any movie stars?

					TRIPLETTE
			I know a couple.

					REESE
			No kidding -- Wait till I tell 
			Linnea. Who?

					TRIPLETTE
			Ah... Peter Finch.

					REESE
			Who?

					TRIPLETTE
			Peter Finch -- he's English.

					REESE
			I never heard of him. Name 
			somebody else.

					TRIPLETTE
			Ryan O'Neal.

					REESE
			You really do?  ~ God -- How come 
			you know them?

					TRIPLETTE
			Oh, you meet them at parties and 
			stuff.

					REESE
			I'll be damned. Boy, if you could 
			get Ryan to say something about Hal 
			Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be

					OPAL
			Have your children been deaf since

					LINNEA
			Yes -- yes, they have. It was a 
			real shock at first, especially 
			since my daddy's a preacher, but 
			Delbert and I have been blessed by 
			their being here.

					OPAL
			When did you start singing?

					LINNEA
			When I was little, in church.

					OPAL
			Isn't it unusual for you to be 
			working with a black choir?

					LINNEA
			Yes, it is --

					OPAL
			Well, can you tell me why?

					LINNEA
			It just is.

					OPAL
				 (not getting the 
				 answer she wants)
			How long have you been with them?

					LINNEA
			About three years.

					OPAL
			And before?

					LINNEA
			Just my church and my boys. We all 
			had to go to school and learn hand 
			talking. I just thank the Lord they 
			can see.

					OPAL
			Do you ever do any writing?

					LINNEA
			No, I don't.

					OPAL
			Are you a close friend of Haven's?

					LINNEA
			No, mostly his wife's. She's in 
			Paris, France, right now. My 
			husband Delbert is real friendly 
			with him. Delbert's in law. Does 
			work for him.

					OPAL
			Do you like him?

					ALBUQUERQUE
			Well, that just happened that time.

					STAR
			Well, it better not happen again.

	ALBUQUERQUE turns and looks out the window. They ride in

					STAR
			You lost twenty-five dollars once 
			before that, too, near Christmas 
			time -- I remember that real well

					ALBUQUERQUE
			You got a real good memory, Star.

					STAR
			I remember when I just saw you. 
			Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were

					ALBUQUERQUE
				 (ignoring him)
			What do you have to buy?

			Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get

			Doctor says you'll have to go on

	There are tones of disappointment, most of them are very involved 
	in their own conversations. TRIPLETTE walks toward the bed, but 
	can't really get close enough. He finally captures BARNETT as 
	the people start to leave.

					TRIPLETTE
			Excuse me, Barnett, how's she 
			doing?

	BARNETT turns and studies him for a moment as though he remembers 
	who he is. He doesn't.

					TRIPLETTE
			I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you. 
			I'm John Triplette... a friend of 
			Del Reese... I was at the airport. 
			I just wanted to introduce myself. 
			I'm a great fan of hers. If there's 
			anything you need, just give me a 
			call. I'm at the Sheraton South.

					BARNETT
			She's going to rest now.

					TRIPLETTE
			Okay, I just wanted to see if I 
			could help out at all.

	The crowd is almost out of the room now. We see GLENN there as he 
	steps into the hallway.

					BARNETT
			I appreciate your concern, but she 
			has to rest, so you can go on home.

					TRIPLETTE
			Oh, sure.

	He stands there too long.

					BARNETT
			What do you really want?

					TRIPLETTE
			Not a thing, Barnett, really. I 
			need a little information. But, ah, 
			it can wait.

					BARNETT
			You bet.

					TRIPLETTE
			Okay. Thanks.

	BARNETT says "you bet" again and closes the door after TRIPLETTE. 
	BARNETT returns to the bed with BARBARA JEAN and the DOCTOR.

					DOCTOR
			Well, it's exhaustion, pure and 
			simple, and you're going to have to 
			take a rest or you're going to be in 
			big trouble.

					BARNETT
			She has to be at the opera tomorrow 
			night and then she can go home.

					DOCTOR
			She's not going anywhere, Barnett. 
			This is precisely what I'm talking 
			about. She is collapsing. She 
			cannot go on without a rest or she 
			will have to stop altogether for a 
			long time.

					BARBARA JEAN
			Well, I have to go:  It's too late 
			to be replaced, and, besides, I just 
			can't do that. Those people get 
			disappointed. They've come in from 
			all over, you know, and this Miss 
			Foxy who's been writing to me for 
			years is going to be there from 
			Michigan.

					DOCTOR
			You cannot leave this bed until I 
			say so. The two of you have to 
			understand that. Barnett, you've 
			got to stop this dovetailing and 
			give her some rest. You don't need 
			to make that much more money.

					BARNETT
			It's not the money. The friends 
			and neighbors love her and they want 
			to see her. We got a debt to the 
			public.

					DOCTOR
			Well, they are not going to see her 
			tomorrow night, and I suggest you 
			get on the phone and make the

					BARNETT
			Wake up. You'll sleep the day 
			away.

	BARBARA JEAN rolls over and opens her eyes. She sees GLENN'S 
	flowers and the note that says, "When I die I want you to come 
	along and be an angel with me."

					BARNETT
			I called Connie and she said not to 
			worry, She'll fill in for you.

					BARBARA JEAN
			I see.

	She gets out of bed and goes to the bathroom.

82	INT. BATHROOM - DAY

					BUD
			Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at 
			Harvard.

					OPAL
			Harvard?

					BUD
			Business School so I can run 
			Haven's business.

					OPAL
			What is a turkey shoot.

					BUD
			You go out in the woods and shoot 
			targets -- Whoever shoots the most 
			wins a live turkey

					OPAL
			How in the world did he get shot?

					BUD
			Some guy was drunk and hit him. 
			Accident. Haven almost killed him.

	DELBERT enters after having had a meeting with HAVEN in another 
	room.

					REESE
			Sorry to bother you, Bud.

					BUD
			Yes, sir. Like you to meet Opal.

	They nod.

					REESE
			Need to have you check these out 
			before he goes on that Walker 
			benefit.

					BUD
			Sure thing. Put them here... I'll 
			take them.

					REESE
			Thanks... I'll... go say hello to 
			your mom.

					BUD
			She's in Paris.

					REESE
			Oh... Well... Have you heard from 
			Barnett?

					BUD
			Not yet.

					REESE
			Let me know when you do, all right?

	REESE starts for another room.

					BUD
			You bet.

					REESE
			I'll just be in here.

	He catches OPAL'S eye and doesn't leave.

					OPAL
			Do you know Barbara Jean?

					BUD
			Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.

					OPAL
			Haven's not going to talk to me.

					BUD

88	EXT. OPERA-LAND - NIGHT

	TRICYCLE MAN arrives. So do REESE and OPAL. She records

	pieces of anniversary cake.

					OPAL
			Hi.

					TRIPLETTE
			Hello.

					OPAL
			I'm Opal.

					TRIPLETTE
			Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.

					OPAL
			I'm gathering information about the 
			characteristics of music people. I 
			just finished a documentary on 
			Gandi.

	He looks puzzled.

					OPAL
			The architect  His buildings are 
			drippy. You know, like sand and 
			castles. Then I got this 
			assignment. They want to start in 
			two weeks.

					TRIPLETTE
			Why?

					OPAL
			Why?

					TRIPLETTE
			What?

					OPAL
			What? Oh. A film.

	At this point, HAVEN walks up.

					BARNETT
			Where'd you get the cake?

	They are taken quite off guard.

					TRIPLETTE
			Someone gave it... Here, you want 
			this... I'll...

					HAVEN
			No.

	Somebody walks by and asks HAVEN how the PRESIDENT is.

					HAVEN
			A little worried. Fine, though.

	TRIPLETTE clears his throat and turns his back to HAVEN and 
	continues to talk to OPAL. HAVEN walks off.

					ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
			Ladies and gentlemen, Haven 
			Hamilton.

93	NEW ANGLE

	HAVEN grabs the mike and bursts into one of his more famous 
	songs, then overlaps it with another. At the finish, he accepts 
	applause and begins to speak about BARBARA JEAN.

					HAVEN
			We want to send special wishes to 
			Barbara Jean who is in the Baptist 
			Hospital. She collapsed yesterday 
			morning at the plane christening. 
			Send your prayers and letters to 
			Baptist Hospital, Nashville, 
			Tennessee. Barnett said she wept 
			because she couldn't be here with 
			you friends and neighbors. But your 
			faith in the great Almighty will 
			bring her back here just to be what 
			you want her to be... And her good 
			friend, Connie White, has given up 
			some time with her own mother, who 
			is sick with a kidney disorder, to 
			fill in and send her warmth to you 
			wonderful friends and neighbors so 
			you won't be too disappointed after 
			this message from teeth-sticken, 
			good, gooey clusters.

94	ANGLE TOWARD GLENN

	GLENN politely leaves when CONNIE WHITE is announced. The 
	TRICYCLE MAN takes his seat, next to L.A. JOAN.

	CUT TO:

95	INT. OPERA - ANGLE BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

	ALBUQUERQUE talks to two POLICEMEN.

					ALBUQUERQUE
			I know it's here somewhere. I had 
			it when I walked in, but you weren't 
			here. My name's Albuquerque, and 
			I'm here cutting a record. My 
			people said it would be all right.

	POLICEMAN
	Sorry, miss. No pass, no entrance. Your people should have given 
	you a pass.

					ALBUQUERQUE
			They did. I know I'll find it 
			here.

	We HEAR HAVEN'S VOICE from the stage.

96	NEW ANGLE

	CONNIE WHITE passes ALBUQUERQUE and the POLICEMEN on her way to 
	the bathroom. ALBUQUERQUE rushes up.

					ALBUQUERQUE
			Sister Connie... Connie. Hi, I saw 
			you out there. I just think you're 
			so beautiful. What do you think?  I 
			can't find my pass. I'm here 
			cutting a record, you know, and 
			these policemen here...

	The POLICEMEN standing right behind her. They all know she is 
	lying.

					CONNIE
			I'm so glad you come for a little 
			while, and thank you.

					ALBUQUERQUE
			I could just sit where I was. I 
			wasn't bothering anybody. That guy 
			asking everybody questions made more 
			noise than I ever did. You saw me 
			there. You signed this program.

	A MAN walks into the group.

					MAN
			Miss Connie, you're next.

	CONNIE smiles and squeezes ALBUQUERQUE'S hand.

					CONNIE
			Oh, honey, I gotta go. Thanks for 
			coming. You read what I wrote you 
			now.

					ALBUQUERQUE
			I did. You said, 'your friend, 
			Connie.'

	CONNIE has disappeared and the POLICE start to usher out 
	ALBUQUERQUE. She tries to see and hear as:

	INTERCUT WITH
	SEQUENCE IN OPERA:

100	INT. SUELEEN'S MOTEL APARTMENT - NIGHT

	SUELEEN is in her mirror applying a whole face based upon the 
	stars of the forties. She is listening to the OPERA ON the RADIO 
	and eating pork and beans and tuna from cans. Her room is tilled 
	with photographs of herself and Catholic symbols. She goes to 
	the closet and selects a gown. She is preparing an outfit and 
	face for the benefit.

	CUT TO:

101	INT. BAPTIST HOSPITAL - BAAHARA JEAN'S ROOM

	We HEAR the tail end of CONNIE WHITE'S SONG on the radio. BARNETT 
	is intently listening.

					BARBARA JEAN
			Would you turn that off

	He continues to listen until the end.

					BARBARA JEAN 
			Barnett, please -

					BARNETT
			What's wrong honey.

					BARBARA JEAN
			I don't want to listen to her sing 
			-

					BARNETT
			Don't feel that way, honey.

					BARBARA JEAN
			Then why are you listening to her -

					BARNETT
			Well, I have to go thank her for 
			filling in and it's nice to know the 
			tune she sang.

					BARBARA JEAN
			You have to what?

					BARNETT
			Go to the King Of the Road and 
			thank her.

	BARBARA JEAN gets up out of bed.

					BARBARA JEAN
			Well here, why don't you take her 
			some of these flowers while you're 
			at it.

	She begins pulling flowers from various vases.

					BARBARA JEAN
			Maybe you'd like to work out 
			something with her, too... Split us 
			up... Her on the road and me in town 
			or in the hospital --
				 (she wails)
			Barnett!

	She sits down on the floor at the foot of the bed and begins to 
	cry. BARNETT backs off. If she was hoping for understanding, 
	she is not about to receive it.

					BARNETT
			What the hell is wrong with you?  
			Huh?

	He bends down and looks at her with the eyes of a race horse 
	owner whose investment Just collapsed in the stretch.

					BARNETT
			Wait a minute. You're not going 
			nutsey on me, are you?  Huh...? 
			You're not going to have one of 
			those nervous breakdowns or 
			anything, are you?

	Afraid she has gone too far, BARBARA JEAN stops crying and tries 
	to make everything all right. But she is still choking in her 
	own panic of being left.

					BARBARA JEAN
			A... No... No, I'm just... I'm 
			really fine... I just.
				 (she gets up)
			don't want you to think I'm giving 
			up or anything like that...

	BARNETT looks at her as if from now on he will suspect her of 
	secretly being crazy. He begins to pick up the flowers from the 
	floor.

					BARNETT
			I'll just take these on over to 
			her. Show her your appreciation.

	BARBARA JEAN crawls numbly back into her bed, nodding 
	affirmatively.

					BARBARA JEAN
			Sure... you go on and do that.

	She begins to shiver. BARNETT looks at her, but he makes no 
	attempt to come any closer.

					BARBARA JEAN
				 (very small)
			Barnett?

	He leans in and pats her arm gingerly.

					BARNETT
			I'll tell her thank you, for you.

	BARBARA JEAN nods affirmatively, still shivering.

					BARBARA JEAN
				 (please hold me 
				 voice)
			Barnett?

					BARNETT
			What?

	She senses he can't go any further.

					BARBARA JEAN
			Bye, bye.

	He looks at her again and leaves.

					BARNETT
			Bye. bye.

	He is not out the door before the tears begin again and she turns 
	into her pillow so he won't hear her.

102	INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

	GREEN has come from his wife's room. He sees BARNETT walk down 
	the hall. After a moment's deliberation, GREEN enters BARBARA 
	JEAN'S room.

103	INT. BARBARA JEAN'S ROOM

	We SEE GREEN come in the door. BARBARA JEAN is sti1l trying to 
	control herself, but is not having much luck with it.

					BARBARA JEAN
				 (to the pillow)
			I just get so afraid sometimes. 
			Then I get more afraid. : Just want 
			you to hold me.

	MR. GREEN can't bear what she's saying. He hesitates for a 
	minute and then figures what the hell.

					GREEN
			Hello.

	She freezes, thinking BARNETT has come back and she will be 
	discounted as totally insane.

					GREEN
			Am I disturbing you?

					BARBARA JEAN
			I'm really all right, Barnett. 
			Don't you worry really... I just 
			don't want you to leave me that's 
			all.

	She turns and screams at GREEN.

					BARBARA JEAN
			Oh, my God.

	She scares GREEN, too, but he recovers better.

					GREEN
			Oh, honey, I didn't mean to scare 
			you.

					BARBARA JEAN
			How did you come in here?

					GREEN
			Well, my wife, Ester's down the 
			hall. I saw Barnett leaving and I 
			was just talking to Ester about your 
			being here.	She loves you so much, 
			I just had to come down and say 
			hello. We've been following you 
			since you were a girl. Well, I just 
			scared you to death. I didn't mean 
			to do that.

	She listens to him. The words somehow comfort her and she begins 
	to laugh.

					BARBARA JEAN
			Well, I guess you caught me at a 
			weak moment.

					GREEN
			You'll have to speak up.

	Realizing he can't hear too well makes her feel a little more 
	secure.

					BARBARA JEAN
				 (louder)
			I said, I've been real tired.

					GREEN
			Eater  says she doesn't see how you 
			do it.

					BARBARA JEAN
				 (loudly)
			What's wrong with her.

					GREEN
			Oh just about everything, I guess. 
			Those doctors started on an overhaul 
			and don't want to quit. They keep 
			taking things out. She's going to 
			come home an egg shell. Tough, 
			though.. She's tough.

					BARBARA JEAN
			What did you say your name was?

					GREEN
			Green.

	BARBARA JEAN Well, Mr. Green, you tell those doctors to stop that 
	whittling and get her some Vitamin E. Have her take that three 
	times a day, along with some good meals. If I could cook for 
	her, she'd be well in a minute.

	A NURSE enters.

					NURSE
			Well, Mr. Green.

					GREEN
			Hi, Sherry.

					NURSE
			How'd you get in here.

					BARBARA JEAN
			It's fine. We were just talking 
			about Vitamin S.

					GREEN
			I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.

					BARBARA JEAN
			You remember what I said about the 
			Vitamins.

	She watches as he leaves, sorry to see him go.

	BARNETT, with the flowers, enters and sits in the lounge. 

107	ANOTHER ANGLE

	It is getting crowded by people returning from the Opera.

	OPAL is on one of the house phones, talking to Paris. We can also 
	HEAR the HOUSE PHONE OPERATOR behind the switchboard desk. OPAL 
	speaks in a combination of English and French. She isn't saying 
	much in one language and she might just be talking to the 
	OPERATOR, but is sounds impressive.

108	NEW ANGLE

	CONNIE WHITE and her group step into the lobby. The MC in the 
	lounge, spots her and coaxes her into taking the stage and 
	singing one of her hits. When she finishes, BARNETT walks up and 
	thanks her, handing her the flowers. Meanwhile, HAVEN, who is 
	there with BUD and PEARL, tells TRIPLETTE that CONNIE and BARBARA 
	JEAN will replace each other, but never appear on the same bill. 
	After BARNETT exits, CONNIE leaves with HAVEN, BUD, PEARL and 
	TRIPLETTE. OPAL is still on the phone, now speaking in Ita1ian.

			Hi. I'm John Triplette.

			Hello. John Triplette.

			Hello.

					TRIPLETTE
			Glad to meet you.

					BILL
			You want anything?  A drink?

			Oh, no, listen, I don't want to

			Whose?

					TRIPLETTE
			Hal Phillip Walker.

					MARY
			Oh, no.

					TRIPLETTE
			He's pretty well known down here.

			He's pretty well known all over.

	TRIPLETTE laughs again. BILL and MARY will be tough to convince.

					TRIPLETTE
			I was wondering if you'd like to be 
			in it. It's going to be televised 
			and...

	BILL lights a cigarette and takes a shot of tequilla out of the 
	bottle on the floor.

					BILL
			What's he running for?

					TRIPLETTE
			President.

					MARY
				 (horrified)
			President?

					BILL
			When is it?

			Wednesday at the park. We've got a

	BILL ignores her.

					BILL
			National television?

					TRIPLETTE
			ABC.

					BILL
			How much?

					TRIPLETTE
			Minimum.

	MARY looks at BILL.

					MARY
			We can't support him  We're 
			registered Democrats.

	BILL begins the fight again.

					BILL
			It's an appearance. It has nothing 
			to do with support. I don't even 
			like him.

					MARY
			Bill, he's a crazy man.

	TRIPLETTE moves in fast.

					TRIPLETTE
			Well, he- expressed a particular 
			wish to have you on.

	They stop and look at him suspiciously.

					MARY
			What for?

					TRIPLETTE
			You're real favorites of his.

	They seem to change viewpoints in a moment.

					MARY
			You're kidding.

					BILL
			How come?

	TRIPLETTE settles in like they were old friends.

					TRIPLETTE
			First you have to understand how 
			much he admires you.

	MARY and BILL get caught up in the sincerity. 

					TRIPLETTE
			You sing for people and that's what 
			he's about. He wants to help 
			people. Especially now, you know.

	BILL bypasses all the talk about WALKER.

					BILL
			Where'd he ever see us?

					MARY
			What National TV...?

					TRIPLETTE
			You're doing some recording here,

					MARY
			An album.

			But, I'll take some of that

	There is a long pause. STAR doesn't respond, so OPAL continues.

					OPAL
			She never came. I'm trying to

					OPAL
			Star - oh! that's a fantastic name. 
			Almost as good as Opal. I changed

	She reaches over and turns on the RADIO. He reaches over and 
	turns it off.

					OPAL
			I'm going to make the consummate

			Have you ever done this before?

	She shakes her head, "no" quite caught up in air.

					TRIPLETTE
			Well, it's not too hard. You'll 
			sing whatever it is you want to 
			sing. They'll applaud like crazy 
			'cause I can tell them that you're 
			really something and then the piano 
			and drum will give you a little 
			fanfare and you can sing and take 
			off your clothes or not sing. It 
			really doesn't make much difference, 
			really. But since you've never done 
			this before, singing might help.

	They are near three enormous beef legs waiting to go into the 
	oven. 

					TRIPLETTE
			Now this is to raise funds for 
			someone who can help people who are 
			less fortunate than yourself. The

			I know that you are an artist and I

169	INT. EXIT INN - NIGHT

	TOM enters with L.A. JOAN. The place in crowded. WADE sits at a 
	table with LINNEA. She hasn't seen TOM.

					WADE
			I was in prison for twenty-eight 
			years.

					LINNEA
			Oh.

					WADE
			Premeditated murder.

					LINNEA
			Oh.

					WADE
			Just got out. Had me thirteen 
			lawyers. Missed the electric chair 
			twice. .. Been out three months. 
			Are you heavy?

					LINNEA
			I'm not sure...

					WADE
			I'm forty-six. Do you like to go 
			up or down?

					LINNEA
			What?

					WADE
			High?  Do you ever get high? A walk 
			on the wild side. Ever do dust?

	Before TOM can sit down he is called on stage by the MC. Also 
	present are BILL, MARY and NORMAN, talking about NORMAN'S act and 
	OPAL, who interviews them. LINNEA sees TOM.

					WADE
			All I need is fifteen minutes a 
			night.

					LINNEA
			Fifteen minutes?

					WADE
			Sleep. That's all I need. Don't 
			want to waste no time sleeping. You 
			married?

					LINNEA
			What...?  0h, yes.

					WADE
			Not me. Ain't never loved anybody. 
			Ain't never been married. Won't 
			either.

170	ANGLE TOWARD STAGE

	TOM stands at the mike.

					TOM
			Good evening. Thanks. I used to 
			be part of a group. You remember?

	Everybody laughs.

	TON
	Well, they're here, Bill and Mary. We're cutting a record here. 
	So far, they've done all the work. It's an accident they're here. 
	I've been hiding from them for days now, right?

	Everybody laughs.

					BILL
			You bet your sweet ass.

	Everyone laughs.

171	ANGLE - LINNEA AND WADE

	She in lost in the sound of his voice.

					WADE
			You know who that is?

					LINNEA
			Yea.

					WADE
			I see.

172	ANGLE - STAGE

					WADE

	TOM calls BILL and MARY to the stage. The three of them burst 
	into:  "Since You've Gone."  When they finish, BILL and MARY sit 
	down again.

					TOM
			I'd like to sing a new song for 
			you. I threw away a good one I wrote 
			yesterday. maybe it was the day 
			before -- anyway.. Let's go here, 
			'I'm Easy.'

173	NEW ANGLE

	TOM seems to know where LINNEA is sitting and directs the song to 
	her. After he finishes, he gives the guitar back to its owner 
	and Joins L.-A. JOAN to walk out.

174	NEW ANGLE

	WADE starts in again.

					WADE
			Love, that's a word that's been 
			overused. I'll say I sure like you. 
			Maybe...

	LINNEA is wiping her eyes with a hanky.

	A large group of people starts out the door, among them TOM and 
	L.A. JOAN. TOM steers himself and JOAN to LINNEA'S table. BILL 
	and MARY catch him there. All the while he is talking to them, 
	he writes a note and places it in LINNEA'S lap. OPAL walks past 
	TOM. They look at each other.

					BILL
			Listen, we're suppose to sing on TV 
			day after tomorrow. At the park...

					TOM
			National?

					BILL
			Yes. Percy Warner Park'.

					MARY
			Where are you staying?

					TOM
			Is that for that Walker guy?

					BILL
			Yes, but we're just singing.

					MARY
			Sue was trying to get hold of you.

					TOM
			Come on. He's a crook.

					BILL
			What crook?

					WADE
			I'm a Roman Catholic. You're 
			Baptist, I bet. Catholic means 
			universal, everything, know what I 
			mean?

	She nods again. She can't make out the writing with out her 
	glasses and she doesn't want to put them now.

					WADE
			I'm a scholar of the Bible as well 
			and we're all going to answer to 
			God. Have you read the book of 
			Revelations?

	She nods 'yes.'

					WADE
			You ever read the 'Apocalypse 
			Unsealed?' 

	She is too curious. She takes out her glasses and looks through 
	them lorgnette style as WADE continues to talk.

					TOM
			I'm not coming anywhere near that 
			place. He's a rotten guy.

					MARY
			That's not true.

					TOM
			He's a politician.

					BILL
			He saw us at Tammany Hall.

					TOM
			The Hell he did. Look, I'll see 
			you in the morning.

					MARY
			Really?

					TOM
			You bet. Nine, right?  But count 
			me out of that other thing.

175	NEW ANGLE

	TOM takes L.A. JOAN and leaves. LINNEA panics, BILL burns, OPAL 
	and MARY watch after TOM, NORMAN keeps silent.

					WADE
			My mother. died in '72. They told 
			me after. They said they couldn't 
			find me before, so they told us 
			after.

					LINNEA
			What?

					WADE
			They said go see the chaplain.

					LINNEA
			I'm sorry but I have to go.

	She gets up quickly and leaves. Everybody is gone, too.

					WADE
				 (to self) 
			I'm a hundred years old and when 
			I'm two hundred, I'll die.

	CUT TO:

176	EXT. EXIT INN -

	As LINNEA hurries off, we SEE STAR sitting in his pickup truck, 
	watching and waiting for ALBUQUERQUE.

	END OF MONDAY.

	CUT TO:

177	EXT. HIGHWAY - AT KENNY'S CAFE - MORNING

	The TRICYCLE MAN is helping KENNY fix the car, changing tires, 
	etc. KENNY is under the hood. When he comes out, KENNY tells 
	the TRICYCLE MAN how grateful he is and that he wouldn't know 
	what to do if he hadn't shown up. The TRICYCLE MAN just finishes 
	the job.

	CUT TO:

178	EXT SHOPPING CENTER PARKING LOT - DAY

	A platform has been erected in the center of the parking lot. 
	BARBARA JEAN'S bus is parked nearby. There is a large crowd, and 
	several people gathered around the platform. GLENN is among them 
	so is TRIPLETTE, REESE and OPAL. Radio station personnel and 
	musicians prepare for the show. Finally, the bus door opens and 
	BARNETT leads BARBARA JEAN to the platform. The musicians start 
	and she sings. The sound comes from many huge speakers and 
	people come from stores and shops to hear.

	BARBARA JEAN segues from one song to another.

179	NEW ANGLE

	BARNETT stands to the side, talking to various people TRIPLETTE 
	pulls his sleeve.

					BARNETT
			Well, for heaven's sake. You're 
			just about everywhere, aren't you?

	THIPLETTE
	I came out to see how you all were doing.

					BARNETT
			I think I should tell you I know 
			why you're here. The answer is no 
			... we don't get involved in 
			politics.

					TRIPLETTE
				 (laughs good-
				 naturedly) 
			Well, that's not entirely true, 
			Barnett. At least not according to 
			Haven.

					BARNETT
			Haven? Hell,' we've been playing 
			poker together since we were 
			fourteen.

					TRIPLETTE
			I guess that's why he thought you 
			right want to help out.

					BARNETT
			He knows better.

					TRIPLETTE
			Well, it's probably because it 
			would help him.

					BARNETT
			How is that?

					TRIPLETTE
			Everybody likes to be as good as 
			their word.

					BARNETT
			Whose word?

					TRIPLETTE
			His Word.

					BARNETT
			His word? Are you telling me Haven 
			promised you something?

					TRIPLETTE
			That's pretty close. He's going to 
			be on the bill. Why not put Barbara 
			Jean on with him? 

	TRIPLETTE'S last sentence is caught in silence as BARBARA JEAN 
	has stopped singing in the middle of a phrase.

180	NEW ANGLE

	She holds the mike and looks at Barnett.

					BARBARA JEAN
			Barnett..

	She faints. There in a moment of confusion, then GLENN is on the 
	stage protectively as the musicians clear the people out

181	NEW ANGLE

	BARNETT vaults through the crowd pushing TRIPLETTE aside.

					BARNETT
			Get her feet up.

	He pulls himself on the stage. She is coming to and sees GLENN'S 
	face looking at her and rubbing her hands.

					BARNETT
			Okay, honey.

	He carries her to the bus. TRIPLETTE is forced to watch from a 
	distance.

182	INT. BUS - DAY

	BARBARA JEAN has come to and she and BARNETT are alone in the 
	back of the bus. He studies her carefully for a minute and then 
	decides she'll be all right.

					BARBARA JEAN
			Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.

					BARNETT
			Honey, it's okay... How do you feel 
			now?

					BARBARA JEAN
			All those people...

	She fights back the tears.

					BARNETT
			Don't worry, I'll take care or it

					BARBARA JEAN
			You're so good.

	He blows her a kiss and steps from the bus.

183	EXT. BUS - DAY

	BARNETT sends the nurses inside. GLENN has pushed to front of 
	the crowd. BARHETT grabs a hand mike.

					BARNETT
			She's fine now, folks. Just too 
			soon after the hospital, I guess.
				 (he pauses)
			She won't be able to continue and 
			she's in the bus crying her eyes 
			out, because she doesn't want to 
			disappoint the people who love her 
			the most.

	There is a group groan. BARNETT looks for some under-standing 
	but there is none. There are several catcalls and GLENN, who in 
	near BARNETT, becomes so enraged, he tries to find the caller. 
	There is almost a fight, but TRIPLETTE intervenes. He glances to 
	GLENN.

					TRIPLETTE
			Come on, come on. You don't want 
			to waste your energy on that fool.

184	NEW ANGLE

	Catcalls continue from other parts of the audience. TRIPLETTE 
	shouts against GLENN, who has turned his intensity to the crowd

					GLENN
			She's frail. You never saw anybody 
			so frail. I've seen her breathe hard 
			just standing still, dammit. You're 
			selfish. Worst selfish I've ever 
			heard. What if she died?  Would you 
			like that?  You'd probably say she 
			faked it so they could make money. 
			Well, you're just dumb.

185	NEW ANGLE

					TRIPLETTE
			We could invite them to the park.

					BARNETT
			What?

					TRIPLETTE
			They can come to the concert in the 
			park.

					BARNETT
			I said 'no!'

	BARNETT studies the angry crowd then TRIPLETTE, who is holding 
	back GLENN against them. The crowd is even more angry

					BARNETT
				 (to crowd)
			We're very Sorry... Please... If 
			you'll listen.
				 (he makes the 
				 decision)
			You can see her tomorrow at Percy 
			Warner Park...

	GLENN has disengaged from TRIPLETTE'S hold and pushed his way to 
	the back.

					BARNETT
			Triplette, I want to talk to you.

	Moves closer.

					BARNETT
			I got trapped and you know it, so 
			let's have some rules.

					TRIPLETTE
			Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I 
			understand your position.

					BARNETT
			No, you don't, so don't say you do. 
			Bunch of damn liars. What do you 
			get out or this?

					TRIPLETTE
			Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.

					BARNETT
			Your job, huh.

	He removes a pen and paper and writes down the following as he 
	speaks.

					BARNETT
			She will not appear on the stage or 
			support that Walker guy and you 
			can't have any of his signs up while 
			she sings. She'll be on first and 
			out of the park before he shows up. 
			There will be no pictures, no 
			questions, no answers or tying her 
			name up with his now or in the 
			future to come. Any money she makes 
			will go to the President of the 
			United States.

	He calls over his secretary and makes TRIPLETTE sign the 
	statement. Then the secretary signs.

					BARNETT
			We'll see you tomorrow. I'll send 
			her three songs over this afternoon. 
			She'll be done about ten minutes 
			after she starts and Walker better 
			not show up till she's through. Now, 
			get out of here.

	TRIPLETTE extends his hand expecting friendship. BARRETT ignores 
	it. As TRIPLETTE leaves, a MAN who has been after BARNETT'S 
	attention steps up. BARNETT turns to his secretary.

					MAN
			Barnett?

					BARNETT
				 (sharply)
			What?

					MAN
			Well, Barnett, I have this terrific 
			song I've been working on. It would 
			be a natural for Barbara Jean. Like 
			you to take a look at it.

	BARNETT looks at him suspiciously.

					BARNETT
			I'm very busy right now.
				 (to secretary) 
				 Get me Haven.

					MAN
			It'll just take a minute. Here, 
			I'll even hold it for you.

	BABNETT sighs and skims over the paper. Song stealing is the 
	same as horse stealing to BARNETT. He becomes enraged.

					BARNETT
			I don't know where you got this, 
			but something tells me you stole it 
			and I hate thieves.

	The MAN takes the paper back and tries to walk away from him -- 
	BARNETT yells after him.

					BARNETT
			Aren't you an engineer...?  I know 
			you -- Don't you work at one of 
			those cut a record places...? 
			Twenty-five bucks a shot, isn't it? 
			Usually their last twenty-five...

	The MAN backs up and BARNETT follows him. They have entered the 
	crowd. The MAB starts to run. BARNETT runs after him. When the 
	MAN gets into the car. BARNETT picks up a rock, throws it and 
	hits the windshield with it. The car MISFIRES but finally 
	starts.. As the MAN drives off, BARNETT stands watching until 
	he's out of sight.

186	EXT. FAIRGROUND - DAY

	We SEE a fairground, then a roller rink, and a wrestling ring, 
	and finally a small portable stage in the center of a circular 
	track. The grandstands are partially ruled and stock cars roar 
	from another part or the field;

	Around the stage -we SEE a sign that says, "Talent Show Tonight" 
	and we see the contestants and the MC, and NORMAN doing a routine 
	with an accordion player. After NORMAN finishes, the NC takes 
	the mike.

					MC
			Thank you, Mr. Berguan. And now we 
			bring you, 'Albuquerque.'

187	NEW ANGLE

	ALBUQUERQUE walks to the mike. 

					ALBUQUERQUE
			Hello, everybody. My name is 
			Albuquerque.

	There are-a few nasty remarks.

					ALBUQUERQUE
			I'm going to sing a wonderful tune.

	She starts to sing, "You're an Old Smoothie," and as she does the 
	stock cars leave the pit and drive to the entrance of the track. 
	ALEBUQUERQUE, disturbed at first, sings louder. The cars are 
	waiting for the talent show to set off the track.

188	NEW ANGLE

	Albuquerque starts to take off her clothes. The MC hasn't 
	noticed, but the grandstand has. People shout, "Take it off..."  
	ALBUQUERQUE loves it. Before ALBUQUERQUE can remove the last two 
	garments, the MC rushes over and grabs the mike.

					MC
			We'd 1ike~to announce the winner of 
			tonight's contest. Albuquerque, How 
			about some applause for a darling 
			little lady

					ALBUQUERQUE
			Oh, I'm not through.

					MC
			That's all, folks.

	The stands are calling to have her take it all off and her fellow 
	contestants are furious. RAVEN, BUD and PEARL are there and they 
	discuss her act.

					MC
			Here is the twenty dollars first 
			prize money and a seat in the 
			grandstands and now let's turn the 
			show over to Al Allen in the race 
			stand.

	He shuts oft the mike.

189	NEW ANGLE - TRACK

	The stock cars start around the track and stop in front or the 
	race announcer.

	AL
			Congratulations to Albuquerque and 
			welcome, everyone, to the Memorial 
			Race for Billy Apple, who died a 
			week ago in a wreck at this very 
			track, and we want you to know his 
			last words were, 'Are the other 
			fellows all right?'

	A wave of applause and we SEE the talent show make its way across 
	the rack. The platform is already torn down and the MC is 
	helping ALBUQUERQUE dress. As she passes the drivers, they cheer 
	and she blows them a kiss and loses her first garment as she 
	does. More cheers.

190	NEW ANGLE

	The cars are dented. On the side of one car it says, "Haven 
	Hamilton," and now we see him, BUD and PEARL in the stands. On 
	the side of another car it says, "Connie White."

	AL
	Want you all to save a dime every day and next Saturday we'll 
	take up a collection and give it all to Billy Apple's wife. 
	Share. Their four kids will sure miss their daddy. Want to 
	announce Bob Trilltree is out of the hospital now. Hope you'll 
	be back with us soon. All right, would you stand, please?

	The people stand to a scratchy record of the National Anthem. A 
	'74 Pontiac circles the track with a man holding a medium-sized 
	American flag which flaps as the convertible drive.. At the end 
	of the song the Pontiac drives off the track.

	AL
	This is for Billy Apple. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, let's pick 
	ourselves a winner.

191	NEW ANGLE

	The drivers get into their cars and start up. The track man 
	waves a flag which starts them around the track in pairs. We 
	notice the TRICYCLE MAN, who has been there all the time. The 
	race starts and the SOUND is deafening. ALBUQUERQUE is thrilled 
	to death. Suddenly, STAR sneaks up on her as she whistles with 
	her fingers in her mouth.

					STAR
			Winifred.

					ALBUQUERQUE
			Hi! Star.

					STAR
			Winifred, the kids want you home 
			and so do I.

					ALBUQUERQUE
			I won first prize.

					STAR
			Come on.

	She has no choice but to follow him out. Several people 
	compliment her as she leaves the grandstand. She buys a bag of 
	peanuts on the way out.

	She laughs and eases out of the bed.

					TOM
			When did you think it would happen?

					LINNEA
			I'm not sure.

					TOM
			I knew when I first met you.

					LINNEA
			Oh.

	She starts to go into the bathroom.

					TOM
			How old are you?

					LINNEA
			Older.

					TOM
			Thirty?

					LINNEA
			Well...

					TOM
			I'm twenty-eight

					LINNEA
			Oh.

					TOM
			Older than thirty?

	She nods.

					TOM
			Terrific!  Who was that black guy? 
			A friend of yours?

					LINNEA
			That's unkind.

					TOM
			Come on, you ever been attracted to 
			a black guy?

	She looks at him close, then goes into the bathroom and shuts the 
	door.

193	INT. MOTEL BATHROOM - AFTERNOON

	We HEAR TOM making a phone call. LINNEA grabs a towel and wraps 
	it around her head and throws back the shower curtain, only to 
	find a huge black cockroach in the tub. TOM laughs as she shuts 
	the curtain in horror, then she proceeds to take a sponge bath. 
	She leaves the bathroom quickly.

194	INT. MOTEL ROOM - AFTERNOON

	TOM is still on the phone. LINNEA dresses, but can't find her 
	slip. She finishes and heads for the door.

					TOM

			Just a minute.

	He steps to LINNEA and puts his arms around her. 

					TOM
			I'll talk to you tomorrow.

					LINNEA
			That's what you said before.

					TOM
			I know. Goodbye.

	He kisses her and walks back to the bed. As she gets to the

					TOM
			Maybe you better keep that.

200	ANOTHER ANGLE

	TRIPLETTE is at the stairs. GLENN is trying to get past a guard

	helps him in. They enter the stair area, near all the TV cables 
	and equipment.

201	NEW ANGLE

	They approach BARBARA JEAN, who is talking to musicians. BILL and 
	MARY are there with NORMAN, and LINNEA is singing on stage with 
	the black choir. TOMMY now steps up to talk to BARBARA JEAN.

202	NEW ANGLE

	GLENN is lost in BARBARA JEAN'S magic. She smiles at him, but in 
	talking to HAVEN, BUD and PEARL and looking for BARNETT. 
	TRIPLETTE walks by GLENN.

					GLENN
			Listen, could you give her this for 
			me?

	TRIPLETTE takes a note from GLENN.

					TRIPLETTE
			Sure thing. 

					GLENN
			Thanks.

					TRIPLETTE

	TRIPLETTE hands her the note as BARRETT angrily steps up. 
	Someone calls  "places."

					BARNETT
			They screwed up. You go on after 
			the choir.

	TOMMY BROWN joins LINNEA and the choir on stage. We SEE TOM 
	wandering and avoiding BILL, but catching MARY'S eye. OPAL is 
	near as is LA JOAN. BARBARA JEAN reads GLENN'S note: "If I die 
	tomorrow, I lived today."

203	NEW ANGLE

	The applause builds.

	She is leaning on a stool.

					BARBARA JEAN
			I want to thank you for all your

	The orchestra starts. She calls for HAVEN to come out. The

207	EXT. FRONT OF PARK - DAY

	A long black limo is parked near two ambulances, the attendants 
	sitting on the ambulance fenders and joking.

208	ANGLE - STAGE

	BARBARA JEAN and HAVEN have finished the soldier song. The choir 
	comes out to back her now. The audience picks up the song they 
	sing. After the song everyone claps loudly, and a large bouquet 
	of flowers gets handed up to BARBARA JEAN. They hug as someone 
	begins to unfurl a "HAL PHILIP WALKER" banner behind them. 
	Photographers crowd in. Suddenly there is a sharp jolt in 
	HAVEN'S body and BARBARA JEAN is down. There is brief confusion, 
	but the choir continues to sing and everyone thinks BARBARA JEAN 
	has fainted again.

209	NEW ANGLE

	The confusion mounts as both HAVEN and BARBARA JEAN are down and 
	there are flowers lying all over the place

					HAVEN

	yells for them to stop. He and BARNETT are over BARRARA JEAN, 
	while guards and BUD attend to HAVEN.

					TRIPLETTE
			She's... oh, my God... there's 
			blood here...

			Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know

210	ANGLE - AUDIENCE

	There is a VOICE among the noise that shouts:

	I could have got that Walker bastard before. I've been closer, 
	closer than this, but my Nash broke down and somebody kept 
	stealing my things. I wanted to get him the day before, then Mr. 
	Green's wire died, so this was the right time. I love the 
	President of the United States. I love him.

	Guards grab the speaker, KENNY, in an instant. He shoots a 
	policeman's foot by accident. Men swallow him up. Someone 
	yells, "sing."

211	ANGLE - STAGE

	The choir has no direction to go in. ALRUQUERQUE suddenly is 
	with microphone.. She starts to do "It Don't Worry Me."  The rest 
	of the singers join in.

212	EXT. PERCY WALKER PARK - DAY

	BARNETT leads the stretcher to one or the ambulances. He doesn't

					 WALKER

	Nashville Airport.

2	EXT. NASHVILLE AIRPORT - DAY

	TRICYCLE MAN drives into parking lot and parks next to GREEN'S 
	old Chevy. TRICYCLE MAM: locks his machine and walks toward 
	coffee shop. GREEN gets out of his car, locks it, starts in the 
	same direction. NORMAN parks the limo, goes into main building.

3	INT. AIRPORT - DAY

	NORMAN is attracted to large CONNIE WHITE display.

4	INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

	At the entrance is another "CONNIE WHITE" display and from the 
	jukebox we hear one of her songs.

	The waitress, SUELEEN, drops a fork, then gets another from an 
	overflowing sink and hands it to her customer, TRICYCLE MAN.

	There are several people at the counter with him, including 
	GREEN, who has just walked in. Another man enters, DELBERT 
	REESE. SUELEEN waits on all of them.

	A small black man comes out of the kitchen, carrying a tray full 
	or dishes. This is WADE.

					WADE
				(to SUELEEN)
			You want a ride into town?

					SUELEEN
			You bet.

	REESE looks up, checking out SUELEEN, then WADE, then the 
	TRICYCLE MAN, then his breast pocket to see it his wallet and 
	checkbook are still there, then he buries himself in his 
	newspaper.

					SUELEEN
			Got me an audition tonight.

					WADE
			Well, you just remember, if you 
			can't kick front, kick back, 'cause 
			at least you're kicking... Ten 
			minutes, okay?

	She nods and talks to the TRICYCLE MAN. REESE keeps sneaking 
	looks at her.

					SUELEEN
			I've just been waiting for the 
			right spot to sing in... I'm so 
			nervous...

	She laughs and starts to rinse the dishes in the sink.

					SUELEEN
			I'm good, though. There ain't but 
			one Sueleen Gay -- I don't mean to 
			be conceited, but really it's true. 
			I've been taking special coaching 
			lessons from Zeke Willard -- he's 
			just wonderful. Teaches you how to 
			phrase; that's really important. 
			And breathing. Well, you know all 
			about that. Anyway, I wrote this 
			song.

	She looks down and then begins to half whisper, sing, and half do 
	all of the gestures for a song she has written as she wipes some 
	glasses. The jukebox continues to play CONNIE WHITE, and every 
	time someone walks by, Sueleen stops. She finally gets through 
	the song and discovers REESE has been watching, too. She looks 
	away from him to the TRICYCLE MAN, who smiles. Be has finished 
	his meal.

					SUELEEN
			Oh, listen, I really do go on. 
			Here's your check. Sure has been 
			nice talking to you.

	As she removes her apron, a HAVEN HAMILTON song comes on the 
	jukebox, "Keep on a goin'."  The TRICYCLE MAN leaves.

	CUT TO:

5	INT. CONTROL BOOTH - NASHVILLE STUDIO - DAY

	We hear the last chorus or "Keep on a goin'" as sung by HAVEN, 
	who is recording.

	He is always dressed in white. In the booth are BUD and LADY 
	PEARL. Also present are two engineers and a producer. HAVEN is 
	accompanied by a long haired piano player with a white sweater. 
	HAVEN is not too happy with him. 

6	ANOTHER ANGLE

	OPAL enters the booth, carrying a too-large English tape 
	recorder. HAVEN Stops singing, mad at OPAL'S interruption and 
	the piano player. Through the glass we see him pantomiming 
	instructions for her to leave. As she does, HAVEN starts over.

7	INT. HALLWAY - DAY

	OPAL wanders to the next studio. BUD follows, apologizing.

					BUD
			Sorry. He sees a tape recorder and 
			gets upset.

	She looks at him.

					BUD
			He's my father.

					OPAL
			Haven Hamilton is your father? Can 
			you arrange an interview?

8	INT. SECOND RECORDING BOOTH - DAY

	They have entered a different control tooth. In the recording 
	portion, LINNEA and an all-black, male CHOIR sings a gospel song. 
	OPAL asks BUD who this group is.

9	INT. FIRST CONTROL BOOTH - DAY

	BUD returns. HAVEN has just exploded at the piano player and 
	starts to leave, yelling at the producer.

					HAVEN
			Who the hell is playing piano? Get 
			that hippie out of here... He's got 
			a tin ear. I asked for Pig, dammit. 
			I'm moving on 'cause I gotta get to 
			the airport. When you get my 
			backups straight, then we'll talk 
			about cutting this tune here.

	He heads for the hallway.

10	INT. HALLWAY - DAY

	It is jammed with black singers from the CHOIR. HAVEN hates 
	being crushed and moves through the congestion like a white 
	knight. OPAL moves near.

					OPAL
			Excuse me, sir. I'm here putting 
			together a film. I would like to 
			ask some questions.

	She has to fumble with the bulky tape machine and transformer.

					HAVEN
			Foreigner?

					OPAL
			I'm from BBC television.

					HAVEN
			Where the hell is that?

	HAVEN nod a politely and leaves the crowded hallway with BUD and 
	PEARL. He spots LINNEA.

					HAVEN
			Linnea.

					LINNEA
			How you doing, Haven?

					HAVEN
			oh, fine. Couldn't be better.

11	ANGLE T0WARD OUTSIDE

	They all say goodbye and HAVEN'S group gets into a new white jeep

	CUT TO:

12	EXT. AIRPORT - DAY

	Barbara Jean's plane taxis to a halt.

	REESE leaves a tip and exits the coffee shop to greet the plane.

	TOM spots stews and goes to them

					TOM
			You ladies got room for a spare?

					STEW
			Sure.

14B	NEW ANGLE

	L.A. JOAN is left in the dust.

					L.A. JOAN
			'Bye... nice talking to you.

	GREEN sees his niece and walks over.

					GREEN
			Joan?

	She turns.

					L.A. JOAN
			Did you see who that was?

					GREEN
			Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, 
			too.

					L.A. JOAN 
			He is just wonderful.

					GREEN
			I'1l get your bag.

	CUT TO:

15	EXT. LANDING AREA - AIRPORT - DAY

	GLENN has just deposited a postcard in a mailbox and approaches a 
	gathering cluster of people. NORMAN and TRICYCLE MAN are nearby. 
	Everybody is waiting for BARBARA JEAN to appear. GLENN steps 
	close to NORMAN.

					GLENN
			Am I late?

					NORMAN
			Late!  Oh, Jesus!

	He runs off.

16	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As NORMAN runs toward passenger loading, we see HAVEN'S jeep 
	arrive with HAVEN, BUD and PEARL. It parks and all climb out. 
	REESE and TRIPLETTE approach the 'Barbara Jean' plane. BARNETT 
	is already on the runway, making arrangements. HAVEN'S group all 
	shake hands.

					HAVEN
			Delbert, how are you?

					REESE
			I'm fine. This here is John 
			Triplette. Triplette, like you to 
			meet the Honorary Mayor, Haven 
			Hamilton.

					HAVEN
			Good to meet you.
				 (turns to BUD)
			Bud, have them move the horses.

					TRIPLETTE
			Pleasure 

					REESE
			Where is she?

					HAVEN
			Still inside the plane posing for 
			pictures and signing autographs. 
			She's got a new album cut again. 
			She'll be down in a minute. But 
			she'll be late for the Opera if she 
			doesn't hurry. Bud, get the plane on 
			the walkie-talkie.

	BUD fumbles on his walkie-talkie telephone, but can't seem to get 
	anything.

					BUD
			They don't seem to be answering. 
			The ambulance boys are here, though. 
			Barnett always expects them to get 
			there like a shot. That thing only 
			goes a hundred fall bore with the 
			sirens going.

					HAVEN
			Thank you, Bud.

	BUD nods like he has been complimented.

17	ANGLE TOWARD PLANE

	A wave of noise begins from the fans. The band and majorettes 
	and horses and ropers go into a rendition of one of her hit tunes 
	as BARBARA JEAN appears. Everyone is breaking their neck to see, 
	especially GLENN. HAVEN and REESE give her the first round of 
	applause, then go back to talking. TRIPLETTE has never been 
	exposed to anything quite like this before and stands a little in 
	awe of the situation.

	When the twirling and tricking and music stop, BARBARA JEAN 
	descends the stairs.

					HAVEN
			Bud, tell them to move the horses. 
			Promised this strip would be spic 
			and span.

	He smiles and winks.

					REESE
			Listen, we'll go get the car and 
			come back. This'l1 be going on for 
			a while.

					HAVEN
			You bet. She's probably talking to 
			somebody about their sick child. You 
			know how she is.

	They wave goodbye and head in the direction of the loading zone. 
	Behind them, the horse people disperse and get into their cars 
	and horse trailers, preparing to return to Nashville.

18	ANOTHER ANGLE

	BARNETT comes over to REESE, TRIPLETTE, HAVEN, BUD and PEARL 
	while BARBARA JEAN continues to greet fans.

19	EXT. AIRPORT NEAR PARKING LOT - DAY

	While the BARBARA JEAN arrival takes place on the runway NORMAN 
	finds BILL and MARY. NORMAN speaks softly and out of breath, 
	trying to pretend he's on time.

					NORMAN
			Hi.

	BILL slaps him on the back and engulfs him.

					BILL
			Hi, Norman.

	NORMAN looks relieved. BILL and MARY have been arguing.

					NORMAN
			Sure is nice to see you all again. 
			I never thought I'd see you again 
			after the last time.

					BILL
			Oh, Norman, you worry too much.

	MARY takes NORMAN'S hand.

					MARY
			Norman, how are you?

	She kisses him and he blushes. BILL and MARY are glad to talk to 
	someone else.

					NORMAN
			Fine. Just fine.

	As they walk to the limo, we see a car with loudspeakers on top 
	of it and clearly written door signs that read: "Replacement 
	Party" in red, white and blue. REESE and TILIPLETTE are walking 
	toward it, shaking hands with several people.

					NORMAN
			Sure have missed you all, though. 
			Oh, where's Tom?  Isn't he with you?

					BILL
			Don't worry about old Tom.

20	ANOTHER ANGLE

	TOM and the stews walk to a VW with a sun roof.

	Nearby REESE and TRIPLETTE get into their Cadillac, behind it the 
	Replacement Party car. Coming from the loudspeakers a tape-
	recorded VOICE:

					VOICE
			Have you thought about your future 
			and what America needs to examine...

	Behind the Replacement Party car is an airport bus with "Connie 
	White" posters on the side. GLENN is one or the passengers. He 
	cranes his neck to continue watching the runway and BARBARA JEAN.

21	EXT. PARKING LOT

	NORMAN'S limo, with BILL and MARY, follows traffic as the 
	TRICYCLE MAN fires up his machine. WADE'S car with SUELEEN also 
	joins the procession.

22	ANGLE TOWARD RUNWAY

	The orange ambulance has moved into the area near the plane and 
	there seems to be a great deal at activity.

	REESE and TRIPLETTE'S car stops, and they rush out and run into 
	HAVEN, who is shouting for people to get the hell out of the way.

23	NEW ANGLE

	Two ambulance ATTENDANTS cut through the crowd. HAVEN, TRIPLETTE 
	and REESE rush near. BARNETT is on his knees over BARBARA JEAN, 
	who has collapsed. The ATTENDANTS lean over her with ammonia. 
	They test her reflexes, etc..

					ATTENDANT
			How long was she out?

					BARNETT
			Not too long. But she keeps 
			passing out.

	She comes to and looks at them all.

					BARBARA JEAN
				 (oblivious)
			Just give your manna that vitamin 
			E. Makes a world of difference.

					HAVEN
			Here she is again.

	She resists the ammonia, looks around and passes out again.

					ATTENDANT
			Okay, let's get her to the wagon.

	A stretcher is brought in and she is placed under oxygen. BARNETT 
	climbs into the ambulance with BARBARA JEAN, slamming the door on 
	DELBERT and TRIPLETTE. HAVEN stands there, yelling at people. 
	DELBERT and TRIPLETTE rush back to their car as the ambulance 
	speeds off, siren wailing.

	L.A. JOAN is trying to find a station she likes on her transistor 
	radio.

					L.A. JOAN
			Uh huh.

					GREEN
			She's been in the hospital two 
			weeks yesterday.

	L.A. JOAN can't find anything she likes. 

					L.A. JOAN
			You know anything about the 
			stations here?

					GREEN
				 (hasn't heard) 
			It's hard to say. Doctors thought 
			she'd come home a week ago. All it 
			was was appendix.

					L.A. JOAN
			All they got is advertisements. 
			Just like L.A.

					GREEN
			Did an exploratory and according to 
			them, she needed an overhaul.

	He chuckles at his prepared joke.

					L.A. JOAN
			Well, I could use one, especially 
			if I'm pregnant.

					GREEN
			What did you say?

					L.A. JOAN
			I said, maybe I'll change my name 
			again.

					GREEN
			I see... Well, those doctors are 
			real miracle workers.

					L.A. JOAN
			But not unless Nashville really

					PEARL
			We had these two city boys come in

			The other one said that wasn't true. 
			Then the first said he looked just 
			like Eddie Black when he said 
			that...

					HAVEN
			Bud, would you be sure to get the 
			oil changed?

					BUD
			Ya... where do you want me to take 
			it?

					PEARL
			Do you remember Eddie Black? He had 
			those blue eyes.

					HAVEN
			Where you always take it. There's 
			nothing special about this time.

					PEARL
			And they started pounding on each 
			other. But the one without the foot 
			was strongest.

					HAVEN
			Bud, you're going to have to show 
			up at the hospital tar me I gotta 
			get back to that session.

					BUD
			Okay. Anything you want me to say?

					HAVEN
			Say I had to get back to the 
			session. ~ God -- All school did 
			for you, you can put in a thimble.

					PEARL

	SUELEEN in doing some vocal exercising. WADE listens for awhile.

					WADE
			Is that what you're going to sing?

	She laughs.

					SUELEEN
			No -- That's exercises. My coach 
			says you have to do exercise because 
			the vocal chords are muscle and need 
			to be stretched. Every time you 
			stretch them, the middle part sets 
			stronger. That's the place where I 
			sing.

					WADE
			You think I got any kind of a 
			voice?

	He breaks into a scale.

					SUELEEN
			You sure do it loud.

					WADE
			Is that good?

					SUELEEN
			It's not bad.

					WADE
			You think I should take lessons?

					SUELEEN
			If you're serious. Being serious 
			is real important.

					WADE
			You serious?

					SUELEEN
			Wade -- I've been working toward

	BARBARA JEAN is in bed. A DOCTOR is there, along with a crowd of 
	publicity people and well-wishers, including: TRIPLETTE, REESE, 
	BUD. BARNETT hovers over BARBARA JEAN. The atmosphere is 
	stifling.

					DOCTOR
			Barbara, I'd like to talk to you 
			and Barnett alone.

					BARNETT
			Anything you say.

	He turns to the visitors.

					BARNETT
			Doctor says you'll have to go on 
			out now

	There are tones of disappointment, most of them are very involved 
	in their own conversations. TRIPLETTE walks toward the bed, but 
	can't really get close enough. He finally captures BARNETT as 
	the people start to leave.

					TRIPLETTE
			Excuse me, Barnett, how's she 
			doing?

	BARNETT turns and studies him for a moment as though he remembers 
	who he is. He doesn't.

					TRIPLETTE
			I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you. 
			I'm John Triplette... a friend of 
			Del Reese... I was at the airport. 
			I just wanted to introduce myself. 
			I'm a great fan of hers. If there's 
			anything you need, just give me a 
			call. I'm at the Sheraton South.

					BARNETT
			She's going to rest now.

					TRIPLETTE
			Okay, I just wanted to see if I 
			could help out at all.

	The crowd is almost out of the room now. We see GLENN there as he 
	steps into the hallway.

					BARNETT
			I appreciate your concern, but she 
			has to rest, so you can go on home.

					TRIPLETTE
			Oh, sure.

	He stands there too long.

					BARNETT
			What do you really want?

					TRIPLETTE
			Not a thing, Barnett, really. I 
			need a little information. But, ah, 
			it can wait.

					BARNETT
			You bet.

					TRIPLETTE
			Okay. Thanks.

	BARNETT says "you bet" again and closes the door after TRIPLETTE. 
	BARNETT returns to the bed with BARBARA JEAN and the DOCTOR.

					DOCTOR
			Well, it's exhaustion, pure and 
			simple, and you're going to have to 
			take a rest or you're going to be in 
			big trouble.

					BARNETT
			She has to be at the opera tomorrow 
			night and then she can go home.

					DOCTOR
			She's not going anywhere, Barnett. 
			This is precisely what I'm talking 
			about. She is collapsing. She 
			cannot go on without a rest or she 
			will have to stop altogether for a 
			long time.

					BARBARA JEAN
			Well, I have to go:  It's too late 
			to be replaced, and, besides, I just 
			can't do that. Those people get 
			disappointed. They've come in from 
			all over, you know, and this Miss 
			Foxy who's been writing to me for 
			years is going to be there from 
			Michigan.

					DOCTOR
			You cannot leave this bed until I 
			say so. The two of you have to 
			understand that. Barnett, you've 
			got to stop this dovetailing and 
			give her some rest. You don't need 
			to make that much more money.

					BARNETT
			It's not the money. The friends 
			and neighbors love her and they want 
			to see her. We got a debt to the 
			public.

					DOCTOR
			Well, they are not going to see her 
			tomorrow night, and I suggest you 
			get on the phone and make the 
			necessary arrangements.

	They are taken quite off guard.

					TRIPLETTE
			Someone gave it... Here, you want 
			this... I'll...

					HAVEN
			No.

	Somebody walks by and asks HAVEN how the PRESIDENT is.

					HAVEN
			A little worried. Fine, though.

	TRIPLETTE clears his throat and turns his back to HAVEN and 
	continues to talk to OPAL. HAVEN walks off.

					ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
			Ladies and gentlemen, Haven 
			Hamilton.

93	NEW ANGLE

	HAVEN grabs the mike and bursts into one of his more famous 
	songs, then overlaps it with another. At the finish, he accepts 
	applause and begins to speak about BARBARA JEAN.

					HAVEN
			We want to send special wishes to 
			Barbara Jean who is in the Baptist 
			Hospital. She collapsed yesterday 
			morning at the plane christening. 
			Send your prayers and letters to 
			Baptist Hospital, Nashville, 
			Tennessee. Barnett said she wept 
			because she couldn't be here with 
			you friends and neighbors. But your 
			faith in the great Almighty will 
			bring her back here just to be what 
			you want her to be... And her good 
			friend, Connie White, has given up 
			some time with her own mother, who 
			is sick with a kidney disorder, to 
			fill in and send her warmth to you 
			wonderful friends and neighbors so 
			you won't be too disappointed after 
			this message from teeth-sticken, 
			good, gooey clusters.

94	ANGLE TOWARD GLENN

	TRICYCLE MAN takes his seat, next to L.A. JOAN.

95	INT. OPERA - ANGLE BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

	ALBUQUERQUE talks to two POLICEMEN.

					ALBUQUERQUE
			I know it's here somewhere. I had 
			it when I walked in, but you weren't 
			here. My name's Albuquerque, and 
			I'm here cutting a record. My 
			people said it would be all right.

	POLICEMAN
	Sorry, miss. No pass, no entrance. Your people should have given 
	you a pass.

					ALBUQUERQUE
			They did. I know I'll find it 
			here.

	We HEAR HAVEN'S VOICE from the stage.

96	NEW ANGLE

	CONNIE WHITE passes ALBUQUERQUE and the POLICEMEN on her way to 
	the bathroom. ALBUQUERQUE rushes up.

					ALBUQUERQUE
			Sister Connie... Connie. Hi, I saw 
			you out there. I just think you're 
			so beautiful. What do you think?  I 
			can't find my pass. I'm here 
			cutting a record, you know, and 
			these policemen here...

	The POLICEMEN standing right behind her. They all know she is 
	lying.

					CONNIE
			I'm so glad you come for a little 
			while, and thank you.

					ALBUQUERQUE
			I could just sit where I was. I 
			wasn't bothering anybody. That guy 
			asking everybody questions made more 
			noise than I ever did. You saw me 
			there. You signed this program.

	A MAN walks into the group.

					MAN
			Miss Connie, you're next.

	CONNIE smiles and squeezes ALBUQUERQUE'S hand.

					CONNIE
			Oh, honey, I gotta go. Thanks for 
			coming. You read what I wrote you 
			now.

					ALBUQUERQUE
			I did. You said, 'your friend, 
			Connie.'

	CONNIE has disappeared and the POLICE start to usher out 
	ALBUQUERQUE. She tries to see and hear as:

	We HEAR the tail end of CONNIE WHITE'S SONG on the radio. BARNETT

					BARBARA JEAN
			Would you turn that off

	He continues to listen until the end.

					BARBARA JEAN 
			Barnett, please -

					BARNETT
			What's wrong honey.

					BARBARA JEAN
			I don't want to listen to her sing 
			-

					BARNETT
			Don't feel that way, honey.

					BARBARA JEAN
			Then why are you listening to her -

					BARNETT
			Well, I have to go thank her for 
			filling in and it's nice to know the 
			tune she sang.

					BARBARA JEAN
			You have to what?

					BARNETT
			Go to the King Of the Road and 
			thank her.

	BARBARA JEAN gets up out of bed.

					BARBARA JEAN
			Well here, why don't you take her 
			some of these flowers while you're 
			at it.

	She begins pulling flowers from various vases.

					BARBARA JEAN
			Maybe you'd like to work out 
			something with her, too... Split us 
			up... Her on the road and me in town 
			or in the hospital --
				 (she wails)
			Barnett!

	She sits down on the floor at the foot of the bed and begins to 
	cry. BARNETT backs off. If she was hoping for understanding, 
	she is not about to receive it.

					BARNETT
			What the hell is wrong with you?  
			Huh?

	He bends down and looks at her with the eyes of a race horse 
	owner whose investment Just collapsed in the stretch.

					BARNETT
			Wait a minute. You're not going 
			nutsey on me, are you?  Huh...? 
			You're not going to have one of 
			those nervous breakdowns or 
			anything, are you?

	Afraid she has gone too far, BARBARA JEAN stops crying and tries 
	to make everything all right. But she is still choking in her 
	own panic of being left.

					BARBARA JEAN
			A... No... No, I'm just... I'm 
			really fine... I just.
				 (she gets up)
			don't want you to think I'm giving 
			up or anything like that...

	BARNETT looks at her as if from now on he will suspect her of 
	secretly being crazy. He begins to pick up the flowers from the 
	floor.

					BARNETT
			I'll just take these on over to 
			her. Show her your appreciation.

	BARBARA JEAN crawls numbly back into her bed, nodding 
	affirmatively.

					BARBARA JEAN
			Sure... you go on and do that.

	She begins to shiver. BARNETT looks at her, but he makes no 
	attempt to come any closer.

					BARBARA JEAN
				 (very small)
			Barnett?

	He leans in and pats her arm gingerly.

					BARNETT
			I'll tell her thank you, for you.

	BARBARA JEAN nods affirmatively, still shivering.

					BARBARA JEAN
				 (please hold me 
				 voice)
			Barnett?

					BARNETT
			What?

	She senses he can't go any further.

					BARBARA JEAN
			Bye, bye.

	He looks at her again and leaves.

					BARNETT
			Bye. bye.

	He is not out the door before the tears begin again and she turns 
	into her pillow so he won't hear her.

102	INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

	GREEN has come from his wife's room. He sees BARNETT walk down 
	the hall. After a moment's deliberation, GREEN enters BARBARA 
	JEAN'S room.

103	INT. BARBARA JEAN'S ROOM

	We SEE GREEN come in the door. BARBARA JEAN is sti1l trying to 
	control herself, but is not having much luck with it.

					BARBARA JEAN
				 (to the pillow)
			I just get so afraid sometimes. 
			Then I get more afraid. : Just want 
			you to hold me.

	MR. GREEN can't bear what she's saying. He hesitates for a 
	minute and then figures what the hell.

					GREEN
			Hello.

	She freezes, thinking BARNETT has come back and she will be 
	discounted as totally insane.

					GREEN
			Am I disturbing you?

					BARBARA JEAN
			I'm really all right, Barnett. 
			Don't you worry really... I just 
			don't want you to leave me that's 
			all.

	She turns and screams at GREEN.

					BARBARA JEAN
			Oh, my God.

	She scares GREEN, too, but he recovers better.

					GREEN
			Oh, honey, I didn't mean to scare 
			you.

					BARBARA JEAN
			How did you come in here?

					GREEN
			Well, my wife, Ester's down the 
			hall. I saw Barnett leaving and I 
			was just talking to Ester about your 
			being here.	She loves you so much, 
			I just had to come down and say 
			hello. We've been following you 
			since you were a girl. Well, I just 
			scared you to death. I didn't mean 
			to do that.

	She listens to him. The words somehow comfort her and she begins 
	to laugh.

					BARBARA JEAN
			Well, I guess you caught me at a 
			weak moment.

					GREEN
			You'll have to speak up.

	Realizing he can't hear too well makes her feel a little more 
	secure.

					BARBARA JEAN
				 (louder)
			I said, I've been real tired.

					GREEN
			Eater  says she doesn't see how you 
			do it.

					BARBARA JEAN
				 (loudly)
			What's wrong with her.

					GREEN
			Oh just about everything, I guess. 
			Those doctors started on an overhaul 
			and don't want to quit. They keep 
			taking things out. She's going to 
			come home an egg shell. Tough, 
			though.. She's tough.

					BARBARA JEAN
			What did you say your name was?

					GREEN
			Green.

	BARBARA JEAN Well, Mr. Green, you tell those doctors to stop that 
	whittling and get her some Vitamin E. Have her take that three 
	times a day, along with some good meals. If I could cook for 
	her, she'd be well in a minute.

	A NURSE enters.

					NURSE
			Well, Mr. Green.

					GREEN
			Hi, Sherry.

					NURSE
			How'd you get in here.

					BARBARA JEAN
			It's fine. We were just talking 
			about Vitamin S.

	It is getting crowded by people returning from the Opera.

	OPAL is on one of the house phones, talking to Paris. We can also 
	HEAR the HOUSE PHONE OPERATOR behind the switchboard desk. OPAL 
	speaks in a combination of English and French. She isn't saying 
	much in one language and she might just be talking to the 
	OPERATOR, but is sounds impressive.

108	NEW ANGLE

	CONNIE WHITE and her group step into the lobby. The MC in the 
	lounge, spots her and coaxes her into taking the stage and 
	singing one of her hits. When she finishes, BARNETT walks up and 
	thanks her, handing her the flowers. Meanwhile, HAVEN, who is 
	there with BUD and PEARL, tells TRIPLETTE that CONNIE and BARBARA 
	JEAN will replace each other, but never appear on the same bill. 
	After BARNETT exits, CONNIE leaves with HAVEN, BUD, PEARL and

			Minimum.

	MARY looks at BILL.

			We can't support him  We're

			Well, he- expressed a particular

			You're real favorites of his.

	They seem to change viewpoints in a moment.

			You're kidding.

			How come?

	TRIPLETTE settles in like they were old friends.

			First you have to understand how

	MARY and BILL get caught up in the sincerity. 

					TRIPLETTE
			You sing for people and that's what

	OPAL opens the door and gets in.

			You weren't really going to drive

	STAR just looks at her. She smiles back.

					OPAL
			My name's Opal. What's yours?

	STAR drives off.

					OPAL
			You going to Nashville?

	He grunts.

					OPAL
			Good. I came out here to meet some 
			underground singer. They say she 
			only writes in those trees over 
			there.

	There is a long pause. STAR doesn't respond, so OPAL continues.

					OPAL
			She never came. I'm trying to 
			gather some information about the 
			characteristics of music people for 
			English television. I started in 
			San Francisco. Some friends were 
			making an anti-war film about 'Nam, 
			you know, and I just love marine 
			movies. It is really the consummate 
			art form, all those parts of the 
			puzzle to make the whole. All that 
			energy being collective, you know 
			what I mean?

	She removes same of her clothes because or the heat 

					OPAL
			I've been all over the United 
			States now except for Maine and 
			Vermont.

	STAR looks at her body and changes lanes.

					OPAL
			What did you say your name was?

					STAR
			Star.

					OPAL
			Star - oh! that's a fantastic name. 
			Almost as good as Opal. I changed 
			my name in Taos. This man that was 
			really into low budget movies said 
			my eyes were opalistic.

	She reaches over and turns on the RADIO. He reaches over and 
	turns it off.

					OPAL
			I'm going to make the consummate 
			documentary as soon as I finish 
			gathering information. You know 
			it's so nice not to feel oppressed 
			in a society that is male oriented.

					STAR
			Are you in music?

					OPAL
			No, I told you that.

	says, "ha-ha."  KENNY is dumbfounded.

					KENNY
			What the hell?

	He opens the trunk. There are several political posters and 
	politically motivated materials for WALKER.

					JOAN
			What's this?

					KENNY
			Replacement party.

					JOAN
			Who's that?

					KENNY
			A guy named Walker. Amazing 
			person. He's developed a huge 
			following.

					JOAN
			How do you know?

					KENNY
			Well I've been following him around 
			Just listening to him --He says he 
			can really win -- I bet he can too -
			-

					JOAN
			You must really like him.

					KENNY
			Well, he's really amazing.

			I haven't gotten into politics yet. 
			I'm still into music --except for

					REESE
			It's on National television,

					BARNETT
			I don't care. She's always been

			going to change.

	There is a pause. BARNETT and REESE have been talking away from 
	BARBARA JEAN.

					REESE
			Well, how about the shopping

					BARNETT
			Yes. She's pretty rested up.

			Didn't you get?... How are you?

					GREEN
			I'm fine. Can I go up?

					GREEN
			You want me to wait?

					NURSE
			No. Mr. Green, I don't know how to

146B	ANOTHER ANGLE

	He wanders to the waiting area. GLENN has been looking out the 
	window at BARBARA JEAN getting into the bus. He comes back and 
	begins to talk to GREEN so caught up in her he doesn't register 
	GREEN'S grief.

					GLENN
				 (loudly)
			My mamma used to know her... They 
			lived next door to each other... she 
			said she was always nursing the sick 
			animals.

	GREEN looks at him and nods. He's still got the vitamins in his 
	hand.

					GLENN
			I really learned all about her from 
			my Momma -- She's been saving this 
			scrap book about her since she got 
			to be famous.

	GREEN nods.

					GLENN
			The one thing she said to me when I 
			joined was "When you're doing your 
			travels you be sure you see Barbara 
			Jean. You don't have to say 
			anything about me but you be sure 
			you see her."  So that's what I've 
			been doing. Now I'm going to hitch 
			a ride so I can see her in Memphis.

	GREEN nods.

					GLENN
			You give my test to your wife1

	GREEN nods and puts the vitamins in his pocket as the NURSE calls

	SUELEEN almost trips over REESE and TRIPLETTE and another man who 
	are talking.

					SUELEEN
			Hi, I'm Sueleen Gay.

					TRIPLETTE
			I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I 
			got all caught up in looking at you. 
			You'll be fine.

					SUELEEN

	She removes her coat and exposes a costume that looks like a 
	picture of a frosty glass or gin and tonic on a hot day. 
	TIRIPLETTE stares blatantly and REESE can hardly keep his hands 
	off her. SUELEEN starts into her routine as a matter of 
	survival.

					SUELEEN
			You like it?  Listen, where is the 
			pianist?  I need to go over this 
			with him.

	She hands over a stack of music.

					SUELEEN
			You all didn't say what you wanted 
			to hear.

	TRIPLETTE smiles.

			Someday I'm gonna be a star like 
			Barbara Jean.

	TRIPLETTE puts his arm around her and walks off.

154	NEW ANGLE

					TRIPLETTE
			Sueleen, you're prettier and 
			probably sing better. Besides, she 
			is unusually sick. And tonight you 
			have the opportunity to work in

	They continue to walk past the many places. 

					TRIPLETTE
			Have you ever done this before?

	She shakes her head, "no" quite caught up in air.

					TRIPLETTE
			Well, it's not too hard. You'll 
			sing whatever it is you want to 
			sing. They'll applaud like crazy 
			'cause I can tell them that you're 
			really something and then the piano 
			and drum will give you a little 
			fanfare and you can sing and take 
			off your clothes or not sing. It 
			really doesn't make much difference, 
			really. But since you've never done 
			this before, singing might help.

	They are near three enormous beef legs waiting to go into the 
	oven. 

					TRIPLETTE
			Now this is to raise funds for 
			someone who can help people who are 
			less fortunate than yourself. The 
			more you take off, you see, more 
			money we can raise.

					SUELEEN
				 (like a robot)
			I see.

					TRIPLETTE
			I know that you are an artist and I 
			am sure you are very religious.

	She nods "yes."

			Well, this is for people who have a

			they live.

	STAR drives up behind REESE'S double-parked ear and has to move 
	around it. SUELEEN starts for her room, but REESE follows very 
	close. Finally, he turns her around.

					REESE
			Sueleen... Sueleen Gay.

	His look says what he wants. She is terrified.

			Oh, no.

	She starts to walk quickly, but he grabs her arm.

					REESE
			Wait a minute!  I want to look at

					SUELEEN
			Oh, please, Oh, God.

	He pushes her against one or the storefronts.

	He squeezes her arm and she screams.

167	CONTINUED:

			Oh.

	He releases SUELEEN, turns and runs up the street. She slides 
	down and hugs herself. The TRICYCLE MAN doesn't move.

					SUELEEN
			It'll be okay... It'll be okay... I

	After a while, she pulls herself up and starts up the stairs to

	A large group of people starts out the door, among them TOM and

			I'm a scholar of the Bible as well

	and MARY watch after TOM, NORMAN keeps silent.

					WADE
			My mother. died in '72. They told 
			me after. They said they couldn't 
			find me before, so they told us 
			after.

					LINNEA
			What?

					WADE
			They said go see the chaplain.

					LINNEA
			I'm sorry but I have to go.

	She gets up quickly and leaves. Everybody is gone, too.

					WADE

			I'm a hundred years old and when

	END OF MONDAY.

177	EXT. HIGHWAY - AT KENNY'S CAFE - MORNING

	The TRICYCLE MAN is helping KENNY fix the car, changing tires, 
	etc. KENNY is under the hood. When he comes out, KENNY tells 
	the TRICYCLE MAN how grateful he is and that he wouldn't know 
	what to do if he hadn't shown up. The TRICYCLE MAN just finishes 
	the job.

	CUT TO:

178	EXT SHOPPING CENTER PARKING LOT - DAY

	A platform has been erected in the center of the parking lot. 
	BARBARA JEAN'S bus is parked nearby. There is a large crowd, and 
	several people gathered around the platform. GLENN is among them 
	so is TRIPLETTE, REESE and OPAL. Radio station personnel and 
	musicians prepare for the show. Finally, the bus door opens and 
	BARNETT leads BARBARA JEAN to the platform. The musicians start 
	and she sings. The sound comes from many huge speakers and 
	people come from stores and shops to hear.

	BARBARA JEAN segues from one song to another.

179	NEW ANGLE

	BARNETT stands to the side, talking to various people TRIPLETTE 
	pulls his sleeve.

					BARNETT
			Well, for heaven's sake. You're 
			just about everywhere, aren't you?

	THIPLETTE
	I came out to see how you all were doing.

					BARNETT
			I think I should tell you I know 
			why you're here. The answer is no 
			... we don't get involved in 
			politics.

					TRIPLETTE
				 (laughs good-
				 naturedly) 
			Well, that's not entirely true, 
			Barnett. At least not according to 
			Haven.

					BARNETT
			Haven? Hell,' we've been playing 
			poker together since we were 
			fourteen.

					TRIPLETTE
			I guess that's why he thought you 
			right want to help out.

					BARNETT
			He knows better.

					TRIPLETTE
			Well, it's probably because it 
			would help him.

					BARNETT
			How is that?

					TRIPLETTE
			Everybody likes to be as good as 
			their word.

					BARNETT
			Whose word?

					TRIPLETTE
			His Word.

					BARNETT
			His word? Are you telling me Haven 
			promised you something?

					TRIPLETTE
			That's pretty close. He's going to 
			be on the bill. Why not put Barbara 
			Jean on with him? 

	TRIPLETTE'S last sentence is caught in silence as BARBARA JEAN 
	has stopped singing in the middle of a phrase.

180	NEW ANGLE

	She holds the mike and looks at Barnett.

					BARBARA JEAN
			Barnett..

	She faints. There in a moment of confusion, then GLENN is on the 
	stage protectively as the musicians clear the people out

181	NEW ANGLE

	BARNETT vaults through the crowd pushing TRIPLETTE aside.

					BARNETT
			Get her feet up.

	He pulls himself on the stage. She is coming to and sees GLENN'S 
	face looking at her and rubbing her hands.

					BARNETT
			Okay, honey.

	He carries her to the bus. TRIPLETTE is forced to watch from a 
	distance.

182	INT. BUS - DAY

	BARBARA JEAN has come to and she and BARNETT are alone in the 
	back of the bus. He studies her carefully for a minute and then 
	decides she'll be all right.

					BARBARA JEAN
			Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.

					BARNETT
			Honey, it's okay... How do you feel 
			now?

					BARBARA JEAN
			All those people...

	She fights back the tears.

					BARNETT
			Don't worry, I'll take care or it

					BARBARA JEAN
			You're so good.

	He blows her a kiss and steps from the bus.

183	EXT. BUS - DAY

	BARNETT sends the nurses inside. GLENN has pushed to front of 
	the crowd. BARHETT grabs a hand mike.

					BARNETT
			She's fine now, folks. Just too 
			soon after the hospital, I guess.
				 (he pauses)
			She won't be able to continue and 
			she's in the bus crying her eyes 
			out, because she doesn't want to 
			disappoint the people who love her 
			the most.

	There is a group groan. BARNETT looks for some under-standing 
	but there is none. There are several catcalls and GLENN, who in 
	near BARNETT, becomes so enraged, he tries to find the caller. 
	There is almost a fight, but TRIPLETTE intervenes. He glances to 
	GLENN.

					TRIPLETTE
			Come on, come on. You don't want 
			to waste your energy on that fool.

184	NEW ANGLE

	Catcalls continue from other parts of the audience. TRIPLETTE 
	shouts against GLENN, who has turned his intensity to the crowd

					GLENN
			She's frail. You never saw anybody 
			so frail. I've seen her breathe hard 
			just standing still, dammit. You're 
			selfish. Worst selfish I've ever 
			heard. What if she died?  Would you 
			like that?  You'd probably say she 
			faked it so they could make money. 
			Well, you're just dumb.

185	NEW ANGLE

					TRIPLETTE
			We could invite them to the park.

					BARNETT
			What?

					TRIPLETTE
			They can come to the concert in the 
			park.

					BARNETT
			I said 'no!'

	BARNETT studies the angry crowd then TRIPLETTE, who is holding 
	back GLENN against them. The crowd is even more angry

					BARNETT
				 (to crowd)
			We're very Sorry... Please... If 
			you'll listen.
				 (he makes the 
				 decision)
			You can see her tomorrow at Percy 
			Warner Park...

	GLENN has disengaged from TRIPLETTE'S hold and pushed his way to 
	the back.

					BARNETT
			Triplette, I want to talk to you.

	Moves closer.

					BARNETT
			I got trapped and you know it, so 
			let's have some rules.

					TRIPLETTE
			Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I 
			understand your position.

					BARNETT
			No, you don't, so don't say you do. 
			Bunch of damn liars. What do you 
			get out or this?

					TRIPLETTE
			Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.

					BARNETT
			Your job, huh.

	He removes a pen and paper and writes down the following as he 
	speaks.

					BARNETT
			She will not appear on the stage or 
			support that Walker guy and you 
			can't have any of his signs up while 
			she sings. She'll be on first and 
			out of the park before he shows up. 
			There will be no pictures, no 
			questions, no answers or tying her 
			name up with his now or in the 
			future to come. Any money she makes 
			will go to the President of the 
			United States.

	He calls over his secretary and makes TRIPLETTE sign the 
	statement. Then the secretary signs.

					BARNETT
			We'll see you tomorrow. I'll send 
			her three songs over this afternoon. 
			She'll be done about ten minutes 
			after she starts and Walker better 
			not show up till she's through. Now, 
			get out of here.

	TRIPLETTE extends his hand expecting friendship. BARRETT ignores 
	it. As TRIPLETTE leaves, a MAN who has been after BARNETT'S 
	attention steps up. BARNETT turns to his secretary.

					MAN
			Barnett?

					BARNETT
				 (sharply)
			What?

					MAN
			Well, Barnett, I have this terrific 
			song I've been working on. It would 
			be a natural for Barbara Jean. Like 
			you to take a look at it.

	BARNETT looks at him suspiciously.

					BARNETT
			I'm very busy right now.
				 (to secretary) 
				 Get me Haven.

					MAN
			It'll just take a minute. Here, 
			I'll even hold it for you.

	BABNETT sighs and skims over the paper. Song stealing is the 
	same as horse stealing to BARNETT. He becomes enraged.

					BARNETT
			I don't know where you got this, 
			but something tells me you stole it 
			and I hate thieves.

	The MAN takes the paper back and tries to walk away from him -- 
	BARNETT yells after him.

					BARNETT
			Aren't you an engineer...?  I know 
			you -- Don't you work at one of 
			those cut a record places...? 
			Twenty-five bucks a shot, isn't it? 
			Usually their last twenty-five...

	The MAN backs up and BARNETT follows him. They have entered the 
	crowd. The MAB starts to run. BARNETT runs after him. When the 
	MAN gets into the car. BARNETT picks up a rock, throws it and 
	hits the windshield with it. The car MISFIRES but finally 
	starts.. As the MAN drives off, BARNETT stands watching until 
	he's out of sight.

	CUT TO:

	((THE FOLLOWING Is INTERCUT WITH THE SHOPPING CENTER)

186	EXT. FAIRGROUND - DAY

	We SEE a fairground, then a roller rink, and a wrestling ring, 
	and finally a small portable stage in the center of a circular 
	track. The grandstands are partially ruled and stock cars roar 
	from another part or the field;

	Around the stage -we SEE a sign that says, "Talent Show Tonight" 
	and we see the contestants and the MC, and NORMAN doing a routine 
	with an accordion player. After NORMAN finishes, the NC takes 
	the mike.

					MC
			Thank you, Mr. Berguan. And now we 
			bring you, 'Albuquerque.'

187	NEW ANGLE

	ALBUQUERQUE walks to the mike. 

					ALBUQUERQUE
			Hello, everybody. My name is 
			Albuquerque.

	There are-a few nasty remarks.

					ALBUQUERQUE
			I'm going to sing a wonderful tune.

	She starts to sing, "You're an Old Smoothie," and as she does the 
	stock cars leave the pit and drive to the entrance of the track. 
	ALEBUQUERQUE, disturbed at first, sings louder. The cars are 
	waiting for the talent show to set off the track.

188	NEW ANGLE

	Albuquerque starts to take off her clothes. The MC hasn't 
	noticed, but the grandstand has. People shout, "Take it off..."  
	ALBUQUERQUE loves it. Before ALBUQUERQUE can remove the last two 
	garments, the MC rushes over and grabs the mike.

					MC
			We'd 1ike~to announce the winner of 
			tonight's contest. Albuquerque, How 
			about some applause for a darling 
			little lady

					ALBUQUERQUE
			Oh, I'm not through.

					MC
			That's all, folks.

	The stands are calling to have her take it all off and her fellow 
	contestants are furious. RAVEN, BUD and PEARL are there and they 
	discuss her act.

					MC
			Here is the twenty dollars first 
			prize money and a seat in the 
			grandstands and now let's turn the 
			show over to Al Allen in the race 
			stand.

	He shuts oft the mike.

189	NEW ANGLE - TRACK

	The stock cars start around the track and stop in front or the 
	race announcer.

	AL
			Congratulations to Albuquerque and 
			welcome, everyone, to the Memorial 
			Race for Billy Apple, who died a 
			week ago in a wreck at this very 
			track, and we want you to know his 
			last words were, 'Are the other 
			fellows all right?'

	A wave of applause and we SEE the talent show make its way across 
	the rack. The platform is already torn down and the MC is 
	helping ALBUQUERQUE dress. As she passes the drivers, they cheer 
	and she blows them a kiss and loses her first garment as she 
	does. More cheers.

190	NEW ANGLE

	The cars are dented. On the side of one car it says, "Haven 
	Hamilton," and now we see him, BUD and PEARL in the stands. On 
	the side of another car it says, "Connie White."

	AL
	Want you all to save a dime every day and next Saturday we'll 
	take up a collection and give it all to Billy Apple's wife. 
	Share. Their four kids will sure miss their daddy. Want to 
	announce Bob Trilltree is out of the hospital now. Hope you'll 
	be back with us soon. All right, would you stand, please?

	The people stand to a scratchy record of the National Anthem. A 
	'74 Pontiac circles the track with a man holding a medium-sized 
	American flag which flaps as the convertible drive.. At the end 
	of the song the Pontiac drives off the track.

	AL
	This is for Billy Apple. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, let's pick 
	ourselves a winner.

191	NEW ANGLE

	The drivers get into their cars and start up. The track man 
	waves a flag which starts them around the track in pairs. We 
	notice the TRICYCLE MAN, who has been there all the time. The 
	race starts and the SOUND is deafening. ALBUQUERQUE is thrilled 
	to death. Suddenly, STAR sneaks up on her as she whistles with 
	her fingers in her mouth.

					STAR
			Winifred.

					ALBUQUERQUE
			Hi! Star.

					STAR
			Winifred, the kids want you home 
			and so do I.

					ALBUQUERQUE
			I won first prize.

					STAR
			Come on.

	She has no choice but to follow him out. Several people 
	compliment her as she leaves the grandstand. She buys a bag of 
	peanuts on the way out.

192	INT. TOM'S MOTEL ROOM

	CUT TO:

	There is some lovemaking going on in Tom's bed.

					TOM
			You're really terrific, you know

			faces him.

					LINNEA
			I have to go.

					TOM
			Wrong.

					LINNEA
			I have to go. He sighs.

					TOM
			I know.

	She makes a more to leave.

					TOM
			Stay.

					LINNEA
			I can't.

					TOM
			Car pool?

	She laughs and eases out of the bed.

					TOM
			When did you think it would happen?

					LINNEA
			I'm not sure.

					TOM
			I knew when I first met you.

					LINNEA
			Oh.

	She starts to go into the bathroom.

					TOM
			How old are you?

					LINNEA
			Older.

					TOM
			Thirty?

					LINNEA
			Well...

					TOM
			I'm twenty-eight

					LINNEA
			Oh.

					TOM
			Older than thirty?

	She nods.

					TOM
			Terrific!  Who was that black guy? 
			A friend of yours?

					LINNEA
			That's unkind.

					TOM
			Come on, you ever been attracted to 
			a black guy?

	She looks at him close, then goes into the bathroom and shuts the 
	door.

193	INT. MOTEL BATHROOM - AFTERNOON

	We HEAR TOM making a phone call. LINNEA grabs a towel and wraps 
	it around her head and throws back the shower curtain, only to 
	find a huge black cockroach in the tub. TOM laughs as she shuts 
	the curtain in horror, then she proceeds to take a sponge bath. 
	She leaves the bathroom quickly.

194	INT. MOTEL ROOM - AFTERNOON

	TOM is still on the phone. LINNEA dresses, but can't find her 
	slip. She finishes and heads for the door.

					TOM
				 (into phone)
			Just a minute.

	He steps to LINNEA and puts his arms around her. 

					TOM
			I'll talk to you tomorrow.

					LINNEA
			That's what you said before.

					TOM
			I know. Goodbye.

	He kisses her and walks back to the bed. As she gets to the 
	door, she is hit with something,  It is her slip.

					TOM
			Maybe you better keep that.

	He smiles and she walks out the door.

					KENNY
			Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see

	some food at the barbecue. ALBUQUERQUE'S who has fled STAR 
	again, waits near him. BARNETT is talking to REESE.

200	ANOTHER ANGLE

	TRIPLETTE is at the stairs. GLENN is trying to get past a guard 
	and finally TRIPLETTE recognizing him from the shopping center, 
	helps him in. They enter the stair area, near all the TV cables 
	and equipment.

201	NEW ANGLE

	They approach BARBARA JEAN, who is talking to musicians. BILL and 
	MARY are there with NORMAN, and LINNEA is singing on stage with 
	the black choir. TOMMY now steps up to talk to BARBARA JEAN.

202	NEW ANGLE

	GLENN is lost in BARBARA JEAN'S magic. She smiles at him, but in 
	talking to HAVEN, BUD and PEARL and looking for BARNETT. 
	TRIPLETTE walks by GLENN.

					GLENN
			Listen, could you give her this for 
			me?

	TRIPLETTE takes a note from GLENN.

					TRIPLETTE
			Sure thing. 

					GLENN
			Thanks.

					TRIPLETTE

	TRIPLETTE hands her the note as BARRETT angrily steps up. 
	Someone calls  "places."

					BARNETT
			They screwed up. You go on after 
			the choir.

	TOMMY BROWN joins LINNEA and the choir on stage. We SEE TOM 
	wandering and avoiding BILL, but catching MARY'S eye. OPAL is 
	near as is LA JOAN. BARBARA JEAN reads GLENN'S note: "If I die 
	tomorrow, I lived today."

203	NEW ANGLE

	The applause builds.

					ANNOUNCER
			Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Barbara 
			Jean...

	The audience is swept away.

204	NEW ANGLE

	In the audience we see KENNY and the TRICYCLE MAN and WADE. 
	SUELEEN is there, too.

205	ANOTHER ANGLE -- STAGE AREA

	As BARBARA JEAN sings, GLENN stands next to BARNETT. She finishes 
	the song and looks in GLENN'S direction.

206	ANGLE - BARBARA JEAN

	She is leaning on a stool.

					BARBARA JEAN
			I want to thank you for all your 
			good wishes. You are so important 
			to Barnett and me. Now I want to 
			sing a special song for all our 
			soldier boys.

	The orchestra starts. She calls for HAVEN to come out. The 
	applause swells and, they start a song together.

207	EXT. FRONT OF PARK - DAY

	A long black limo is parked near two ambulances, the attendants 
	sitting on the ambulance fenders and joking.

208	ANGLE - STAGE

	BARBARA JEAN and HAVEN have finished the soldier song. The choir 
	comes out to back her now. The audience picks up the song they 
	sing. After the song everyone claps loudly, and a large bouquet 
	of flowers gets handed up to BARBARA JEAN. They hug as someone 
	begins to unfurl a "HAL PHILIP WALKER" banner behind them. 
	Photographers crowd in. Suddenly there is a sharp jolt in 
	HAVEN'S body and BARBARA JEAN is down. There is brief confusion, 
	but the choir continues to sing and everyone thinks BARBARA JEAN 
	has fainted again.

209	NEW ANGLE

	The confusion mounts as both HAVEN and BARBARA JEAN are down and 
	there are flowers lying all over the place

					HAVEN
			Barnett!  My God, Barnett  I'm 
			shot!

	TRIPLETTE runs up the stairs and the choir continues. BARNETT 
	yells for them to stop. He and BARNETT are over BARRARA JEAN, 
	while guards and BUD attend to HAVEN.

					TRIPLETTE
			She's... oh, my God... there's 
			blood here...
				 (taking mike)
			Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know 
			what to say.

210	ANGLE - AUDIENCE

	There is a VOICE among the noise that shouts:

	I could have got that Walker bastard before. I've been closer, 
	closer than this, but my Nash broke down and somebody kept 
	stealing my things. I wanted to get him the day before, then Mr. 
	Green's wire died, so this was the right time. I love the 
	President of the United States. I love him.

	Guards grab the speaker, KENNY, in an instant. He shoots a 
	policeman's foot by accident. Men swallow him up. Someone 
	yells, "sing."

211	ANGLE - STAGE

	The choir has no direction to go in. ALRUQUERQUE suddenly is 
	with microphone.. She starts to do "It Don't Worry Me."  The rest 
	of the singers join in.

212	EXT. PERCY WALKER PARK - DAY

	BARNETT leads the stretcher to one or the ambulances. He doesn't 
	allow HAVEN to enter.

					BARNETT
			Have your friend Triplette take you 
			to the hospital.

	A man walks up from the limo. It is WALKER. TRIPLETTE is near.

					 WALKER
	What'd she do, faint again?  I'm getting tired of waiting in the

	TRIPLETTE turns and belts him.

1   INT. SUV -- DAY                                                 1

    No sound. We are in a speeding SUV. The passenger, LARA,
    unsnaps her seat belt and reaches for the door handle. The
    driver, JOHN, sees her door open and dives to GRAB her. The
    SUV spins, HORNS BLARE, TIRES SCREECH, cars swerve to avoid
    collision. We aren't sure what is happening, but we know
    something has gone terribly wrong. Cut to BLACK. Read:

                       THE LAST THREE YEARS

2   INT. STEAK HOUSE -- NIGHT                                       2

    Two couples sit at a table, picking at dessert, JOHN and
    LARA BRENNAN on one side, MICK and ERIT on the other. JOHN           
    is attractive in a worn kind of way, but has the eyes of a
    kid with a discipline problem. You have to really know him
    to understand if he is mocking you or agreeing with you. He
    is a master of irony and has a true enjoyment of the absurd.
    LARA looks beautiful even in her wrinkled suit. She appears
    to have had a hard day at the office. She's been drinking
    at dinner; it hasn't eased her nerves. John's good-looking
    brother, MICK, boasts his blue collar roots and a gorgeous,          
    if slightly trashy, girlfriend, ERIT, who isn't ashamed of
    her body or sharing her opinions. JOHN and MICK are laughing.        
    Lara puts cash on the tray beside Mick's credit card.                

                           LARA
               You know what? If you were smart
               you would stop talking right now.

                           ERIT
               Sue me. I just know that women should                     
               never work for women.

    John laughs and applauds.   Mick buries his head.                    

                           LARA
               How can you say that??

                           ERIT
               They're always threatened. Especially
               if you're beautiful and they're not.

                           LARA
               Erit, you are so full of shit.

                           ERIT
               So, your boss isn't threatened by

                 Because she's a bitch! --
                     (as John and Mick laugh)                             
                 --Not because she's a woman.

                             ERIT
                 And you would describe her as
                 "attractive"?

                             LARA
                 That has nothing to do with it!

                             ERIT
                 And there is my answer.

                             JOHN
                 Either of you like another drink?

    Lara shoots John a burning look as Erit builds on her victory.

                             ERIT
                 Women should work under men, men
                 under women. That's it.

                             JOHN
                     (egging her on)
                 But men under men?

                             ERIT
                 That's fine, too.
                     (the men burst into laughter)
                 They're used to it! Why are you
                 laughing?

                             MICK                                         
                     (re: Erit)
                 I don't know, bro, but I think I'd
                 rather work under you than her.

                             ERIT
                     (insulted, shoots back)
                 Oh please, I'd rather work under
                 him, too.

    That was a dig at Mick but Lara is primed for a fight.                

                             LARA
                 You'd rather "work under" John?

                 No, why would I have a problem with                         
                 your little sexual innuendo?

                 What is up your ass tonight??

    Mick throws John a "This is all your fault and now it is                 
    going to explode" look. John feigns complete innocence.                  

                             LARA
                 So, I shouldn't take offense that
                 you're coming on to my husband right                        
                 in front of me.

                 Lara, if I wanted your husband I
                 would have him.

                             LARA
                 How? You couldn't possibly show him
                 more of your tits.

    The men are on their feet before blows are exchanged.

                             ERIT
                 -- You know what your problem is?!

3   EXT. STEAK HOUSE PARKING LOT -- NIGHT                               3

    Mick and Erit head toward Mick's sporty pickup.     John and             
    Lara step into foreground, Lara still fuming.

                             JOHN
                 She is completely full of shit.

                             LARA
                 DON'T try and agree with me now.

                             JOHN
                 You know what? I don't even believe
                 she is in the dental profession.

    Lara knows this game; he is trying to get her out of her
    black mood, and she has no intention of letting him.

                             LARA
                 Shut up.

                 I bet she can't even spell
                 anesthesiologist. Woman's a complete
                 fraud.

                             LARA
                 We went to her office party, idiot.

                             JOHN
                 I think she hit on me that night,
                 too.

    Lara opens the back door of their black Prius and tosses in
    the raincoat she was carrying. They climb in, under....

                             LARA
                 You are completely delusional. She
                 wasn't even hitting on you in there;
                 I just don't like her.

                             JOHN
                 I understand. People who look like
                 that should not be allowed anywhere
                 near oral surgery.

    She feels a smile coming to her lips and tries to force it
    away.

                             LARA
                 You are such an asshole.

                             JOHN
                 You're in the chair trying to stay
                 calm; how are you supposed to do that
                 with those things hanging over your--

    She can't stand how attractive he is in this moment -- she
    stops him short by kissing him passionately. His hands slip
    under her blouse; she tugs at his sweater.

                             JOHN (CONT'D)
                 Someone's going to --

    Her hand goes to his pants. He yanks at the seat lever and
    it goes crashing back, Lara landing atop him.

    After a moment he sits up quickly and pushes down the visors.
    She laughs and kisses him and they disappear into each other.

4   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - BACK DOOR -- NIGHT                            4

    Lara and John enter, Lara carrying her raincoat, her hair

                               LARA
                 Hello!

    JENNA, the teenage baby-sitter, sees right through them.

                               LARA (CONT'D)
                 Did he cry?

                             JENNA
                 Only when I dropped him down the                                
                 stairs.                                                         

    Lara shoots her a look, hangs up her coat and exits upstairs.

5   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY                                   5

    She peeks in her son's room, sees him sleeping soundly.

6   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FOYER                                              6

    Lara comes down to find John paying Jenna. John nods for
    her to check the mirror. She tugs at the knot in her hair.

                              JOHN
                 Thanks.   See you next weekend.

    Jenna exits. Lara shows him that his sweater is inside out.
    John reacts: "Oh God." Lara's smile broadens; she kisses
    him. He pins her to the wall and they start all over again.
    He feels for the light switch. He finds it; we cut to BLACK.

7   INT. JOHN AND LARA'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT                                   7

    Lara wakes, troubled.      It's the middle of the night.

8   INT. LUKE'S ROOM -- NIGHT                                               8

    Lara finds Luke's window closed but unlocked. She locks it
    and looks out. Satisfied, she sits and watches her son sleep.

9   INT.    KITCHEN -- MORNING                                              9

    Three year-old LUKE holds a knife and fork as he sits at the
    table watching his dad cut up his pancakes.

                             JOHN
                 Okay, your turn.

    Luke skewers a piece with his fork.        Lara passes, hustling
    to get to work.

                             JOHN (CONT'D)

                 No, no, no; you feed me.
                     (to Lara)
                 Your son is hopeless.

    Lara grabs her phone and leans over them to take a photo.

                             LARA
                 Squeeze in tight.

                             JOHN
                 You can't do this every morning.   It
                 is way too corny.

                              LARA
                 Smile.   It's just until he's eighteen.

    It flashes. Lara kisses John, puts an alien-looking electric
    toothbrush on the table & walks off to pour coffee to go.

                 Sweetie, you have to stop believing
                 everything you read in a catalogue.

                             LARA
                 You hate brushing your teeth; this
                 one brushes them in thirty seconds.

                             JOHN
                     (as if stung)
                 I love brushing my teeth.

                 Three, and I have papers to grade.
                 Can you pick up Luke?

                             LARA
                 After yesterday I probably don't
                 have a job anyway. Do you think it
                 was wrong to call her a useless cow?

     Lara puts her foot up and jabs herself with insulin.

                  I sent him flowers and a handmade
                  card.

                              LARA
                  You're completely impossible.

                  Did you notice what I got for my
                  birthday this year? A grunt.

                  Mom said Happy Birthday and my father
                  went . Made me tear up.

     Lara returns, trying hard not to smile.

 LARA                   Ever think that someone has to be
                  the bigger person here?

 JOHN                       (to Luke)
                  Remember this for the custody hearing:
                  how Mommy is always scolding Daddy.

 LARA                   How are you going to feel if Luke
                  grows up and doesn't call you?

     Lara can't keep a straight face and heads to the foyer.

 JOHN                   Now she's driving a wedge between us.

 LARA                   I give up.

 JOHN                   And now she is abandoning you.

     Lara grabs her raincoat and notices a stain on the back
     shoulder. Irritated, she heads back to the bathroom.

12 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM 12 
     Lara rinses the stain under the sink, surprised to see it

15 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FOYER 15 
     As John opens the door, DETECTIVE QUINN shows his badge.
     DETECTIVE COLLERO and a team of detectives push past. John
     has no time to react.

 DETECTIVE QUINN                   Police.   Mr. Brennan?

     LUKE sees the police rush past him and gets scared.

 DETECTIVE QUINN (CONT'D)                   My name is Detective Quinn. This is
                  a search warrant for these premises.

     John hears Luke cry and instinctively heads inside.

 DETECTIVE QUINN (CONT'D)                       (stops him)
                  Stay where you are.

 JOHN                   Get your --

 DETECTIVE QUINN                   Touch me again and you'll be arrested.

16 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - DOWN THE HALL 16 
     Lara steps from the bathroom and is met by Detective Collero.
     She sees the coat with the water spot; nods to a team member,
     who takes it and bags it under:

 DETECTIVE COLLERO                 Lara Brennan?

 LARA WHAT?! 
 DETECTIVE COLLERO                 Lara Brennan, you are under arrest
                for the murder of Elizabeth Gesas.

     She takes her wrist and professionally turns and cuffs her.

 LARA                 She's dead??     Elizabeth is dead??

17 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FOYER 17 
 JOHN                     (tries to push past)
                She didn't do anything!

 DETECTIVE QUINN                 I will only --

 JOHN                     (tries again)
                She didn't do anything!

 DETECTIVE QUINN                 Put him in cuffs.

     The uniform pushes him up against the wall and cuffs his
     wrists. John watches as his child cries, his wife is led
     out in handcuffs and the house is torn apart. Cut to BLACK.

18 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- NIGHT 18 
 LUKE (O.S.)                 Daddy!...    DADDY!!

     A light comes on.   John steps out of his bedroom and enters
     his son's room.

 JOHN (O.S.)                 It's okay.     Just a bad dream.

     He comes back out carrying Luke, now SIX YEARS-OLD.
 10. 


19 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 19 
     John lays Luke on the bed and climbs in beside him.

 JOHN                   You okay?

     Luke nods.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                   Okay, you can sleep here as long as
                  you stay on this side of the bed.

     Luke immediately scrambles over his father to take his side.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                   You're such a snake, I don't know why
                  I keep falling for the same trick.

     John kisses Luke, who closes his eyes and snuggles his pillow.

     John reaches for the lamp. Beside it sits the framed photo
     that Lara snapped of the three of them that fateful morning.
     He switches off the lamp, and the screen goes BLACK.

20 EXT. PITTSBURGH -- DAY 20 
     The "T," the city's fast-moving trolley, rises up from
     underground and we CRANE UP to see the city.

 JOHN (O.S.)                   But Sam's your friend, right?

21 EXT. ALLEGHENY COUNTY JAIL -- DAY 21 
     Tilt down from a passing T-Train to find John and Luke,
     walking toward the huge, modern Allegheny County Jail.

 LUKE                   Not at lunch.

 JOHN                   Does he take your food?

 LUKE                   No.

 JOHN                   Did he say something mean?
                      (Luke nods)
                  About Mommy?



 (CONTINUED) 11. 
21 CONTINUED: 21 
 LUKE                   Yeah.

 JOHN                   Did you hit him?

 LUKE                   Yeah.

 JOHN                   Good.    Where did you hit him?

 LUKE                   Near the swings.

 JOHN                   Wow.    I bet that hurt.

 LUKE                   Yeah.

22 INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- DAY 22 
     - John waits in a long line, mostly women. He glances over
     at the pleasant and colorful play area in the corner and
     sees children playing. Luke plays by himself.

     - John puts his key ring in a plastic container. The guard
     takes it and puts the keys with other visitors' belongings.
     John guides his son toward the metal detector. Luke walks
     through and the buzzer goes off.

     John instinctively moves forward to help. A guard stops him
     with a hand on his chest. On the other side of the metal
     detector another guard runs a wand over Luke, pulls something
     from his pocket, looks at it curiously.

 JOHN                   It's a toy!

     The guard runs the wand over the child again; no screech.
     The guard waves John through. No beep. John kneels and
     pulls on Luke's jacket.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                   Don't worry.     We'll get it back.

23 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR -- DAY 23 
     They walk along the hall with all the other visitors.
 12. 


24 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTACT VISITING ROOM -- DAY 24 
     John stares out the window at the city beyond.    Life seems
     so close.

     He looks back into the large communal visiting room; a dozen
     round tables and plastic chairs. The concrete block walls
     are covered with naive paintings in bright colors and messages
     of hope. Luke plays at his feet with a basket of Legos.

     The door at the far side buzzes, a guard opens it and
     prisoners in red jump-suits marked VISITING ROOM enter.

     Lara enters and looks around. She is pale, thin and her
     hair has returned to its natural color. Lara hurries to him
     and gives him a real kiss. She breaks and steps to Luke,
     who plays with his back to her.

 LARA                 Hi honey. Can Mommy get a kiss?
                    (no response. Tickles him)
                Come on, give Mommy a kiss.

 JOHN                 Rat-Bag.   Give Mommy a kiss.

     He gives her a peck on the cheek and goes back to his Legos.

 LARA                 Is Daddy reading you my letters?

 JOHN                 Every night at bedtime.

 LARA                 What are you building?    A fort?

     Lara pulls him into a hug; no response. She kisses his head
     and sits at the table with John. She squeezes his hand.

 LARA (CONT'D)                 Was he scared going to school?

 JOHN                 I walked him to class, gave him a kiss;
                he didn't even look back to wave.

 LARA                 What did you make him for lunch?




 (CONTINUED) 13. 
24 CONTINUED: 24 
 JOHN                   Turkey sandwich, just butter and
                  bread, no "vegetables" on it. He
                  swore he ate his apple.

     He hands her a pack of photos.      Lara devours them.

 LARA                   Look at his friends.   And his desk.
                  This is his teacher?

 JOHN                   Miss Phillips.

 LARA                   You may have to move to another school
                  district.

 JOHN                   Already spoke to a realtor.

 LARA                       (still looking at photos)
                  How was your first day?

 JOHN                   Excellent. Over half my class stayed
                  awake. Talked to your mom.

 LARA                   When is she coming?

 JOHN                   She's having a lot of trouble with
                  her business.

 LARA                   It's only been a couple of years,
                  I'm sure she'll get around to it.
                      (beat)
                  Have you heard anything?

 JOHN                   About the appeal? Yes, and I'm just
                  not telling you. What did Meyer
                  say?

 LARA                   --Don't--

 JOHN                   -- It can take months for the court
                  to rule.

 (CONTINUED) 14. 
24 CONTINUED: (2) 24 
 LARA                   I saw that woman. She was there.
                  She couldn't have just disappeared.

 JOHN                   Meyer's looking for a new
                  investigator.

 LARA                   Her coat snagged my purse, I felt a
                  button pop - they must have been
                  blind not to find it.

 JOHN                   He'll go through all the evidence
                  again.

 LARA                   Great, because I haven't quite
                  bankrupted us yet.

 JOHN                   We're doing fine.

 LARA                       (fondly)
                  You just lie and lie.
                      (strokes his face)
                  But you are very handsome.
                      (admiring him)
                  Can you do me a favor?

 JOHN                   I don't know, I'm a little busy.

 LARA                   I need you to run for governor.

 JOHN                   -- Oh, that I can do.

 LARA                   You can change this rule about no
                  conjugal visits, because I don't
                  think I can last another twenty years.

     She smiles but is already traveling toward a dark place.    He
     reaches out and holds her tight, stroking her back.

 LARA (CONT'D)                   I'm okay.   I'm okay.



 (CONTINUED) 15. 
24 CONTINUED: (3) 24 
 JOHN                   I know. But it's going to be fine.
                  I promise.

     She just stares at Luke, his back to them, playing.

 LARA                   You think he'll ever want to kiss me
                  again?

25 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTACT VISITING ROOM -- LATER 25 
     The prisoners file out and are patted down. Lara turns and
     blows Luke and John a kiss. They watch with the other
     visitors, who all stand on the far side of the room.

26 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CHANGING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 26 
     Lara and the female inmates pull off their visiting jump-
     suits and hand them to a female guard, who searches them for
     contraband. Lara retrieves her regular jump-suit and pulls
     it on over her underwear. Another small, daily humiliation.

27 INT. JOHN'S BATHROOM -- NIGHT 27 
     Start VERY CLOSE ON JOHN'S DIGITAL WATCH. Widen to see Luke           
     standing on a low step at the sink in his pajamas using a             
     complicated-looking electric toothbrush. John sits on the
     toilet, staring at his watch.

 JOHN                   Twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty.

     Luke puts it down and checks his teeth in the mirror.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                   Good?

     Luke nods.

28 EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - GARAGE AND ALLEY -- MORNING 28 
     The garage door opens; the Prius has a lot more miles on it.
     John backs out, Luke in his child seat. He brakes and finds
     PAULA, the woman who lives behind them, at his window.

 PAULA                   How's Lara?

 JOHN                   She's doing okay.



 (CONTINUED) 16. 
28 CONTINUED: 28 
 PAULA                   Tell her we're pulling for her.

 JOHN                   I will.

     She holds up a plastic water bottle.

 PAULA                   They won't recycle these unless you
                  take off the cap.
                      (cap vs. bottle)
                  This is trash. This is recyclable.

 JOHN                   Ok.   Thanks.

     John drives off, wondering what kind of world he lives in.

29 EXT. PARK -- DAY 29 
     Sitting on the park bench, John allows his feelings to wash
     over his face. He watches Luke play with a girl his age.

 JOHN                   Luke!   Let's go, Toad.   Come on.

     Luke runs to him. John pulls Luke's jacket on. He doesn't
     notice the young mother on the next bench, NICOLE, watching
     him admiringly. She calls to the girl Luke was playing with.

 NICOLE                   Time to go, Carrie!

     John glances in time to see CARRIE plop down in the sand,
     arms folded. He shares a sympathetic smile with Nicole, who
     heads to retrieve her daughter. John walks off with Luke.

30 INT. CRIMINAL COURTHOUSE -- DAY 30 
     John waits as a courtroom lets out. MEYER FISK steps out
     with a young associate. He spots John and approaches.

 MEYER                   John, I said my office at four
                  o'clock. I can't leave, I'm in --

 JOHN                       (holds up a Subway bag)
                  I figured you had to eat.

     Meyer relents, turns and calls to his associate.


 (CONTINUED) 17. 
30 CONTINUED: 30 
 MEYER                   Do you have the ruling in Brennan?

     She kneels and digs through her rolling briefcase.

31 INT. COURTROOM -- A SHORT TIME LATER 31 
     John sits on a bench, pale and shaken, flipping through the
     ruling. The courtroom is empty, save a bailiff eating at
     his desk. During this he gets up and walks out past them.

 JOHN                   But what if we find the woman who                        
                  was leaving the parking lot?                             

 MEYER                   The PCRA was rejected. No new
                  evidence can be submitted. Not
                  anymore.

 JOHN                   It was a robbery!   Someone stole her
                  purse!

 MEYER                   And if they'd used her credit cards
                  we would have had something to argue.
                  I'm sorry; this really...sucks.

     John offers a smile at Meyer's unlawyer-like choice of words.

 JOHN                   So, that's it. Now we just have the
                  Supreme Court.

 MEYER                   John, in the last thirty years, the
                  Supreme Court hasn't heard one murder
                  case. No decent lawyer would even
                  file the pleadings.

 JOHN                   So, I need to find an indecent one?

 MEYER                   No, I'm going to file it. But I
                  need you to do something for me.

 JOHN                   Anything.




 (CONTINUED) 18. 
31 CONTINUED: 31 
 MEYER                   I need you to look at the evidence
                  and just forget Lara is your wife.

 JOHN                       (stopped by that)
                  I've seen the evidence, Meyer.

 MEYER                   I'm not saying judge her innocent or
                  guilty, I'm just saying look at it.                        
                  He co-worker sees her leaving the                          
                  scene, she has the victim's blood on                       
                  her clothes, her fingerprints on the
                  murder weapon--

 JOHN                       (is this a bad joke?)
                  We went out for dinner! How do you
                  do that after you kill somebody?
                  She would have to be a psychopath!

 MEYER                   -- And the fight in the office.

 JOHN                   Everyone fights with their boss!

 MEYER                   But this one ended up dead.

     John looks at Meyer anew, feeling profoundly betrayed.

 JOHN                   So, you never believed she was
                  innocent?

 MEYER                   How can you say that?

 JOHN                   So, what are you saying, Meyer?!

 MEYER                   That it no longer matters what we
                  believe; Lara's not getting out.
                  And you have no idea how much I hate
                  saying that.

 JOHN                       (exiting)
                  I'll find someone to file the
                  pleadings.

31 CONTINUED: (2) 31 
 MEYER                   John! Come on! For Christ's sake.
 JOHN!! 
     John is long gone.    Meyer hurls his sandwich into the trash.

32 INT. COUNTY JAIL - VISITING BOOTHS -- DAY 32 
     John waits alone on the visitors' side of the glass. The
     door opens, and Lara steps up on the other side. John smiles
     and picks up the phone, but Lara sees something in his face
     and doesn't pick up her phone, just stares at him.

     John fights to keep his smile and nods for her to pick up
     her phone -- but now she can see the verdict chiseled on his
     face. Lara gasps and cries inconsolably.

     John keeps the smile plastered on his face, but now tears
     run down his cheeks. He taps on the glass and points at her
     phone, but she doesn't respond. He taps harder and harder --
     desperately wanting to comfort her, but she won't allow it.

     He bangs on the glass with his fist, drawing the attention
     of the guard on his side.

     Lara turns and exits. John stands and yells her name, but
     she can't hear it, and neither can we.

33 EXT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- DAY 33 
     We're in an old working class neighborhood.    John sits in
     his car, trying to pull himself together.

34 INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- DAY 34 
     MICK opens the door. GRACE, their mother, looks up from                   
     clearing the lunch dishes. John's face tells them everything
     they need to know. Mick slams his fist against the door.                  

     In the back yard with Luke, GEORGE, John's father turns to
     see Grace tearfully embrace John. George looks away,
     uncomfortable, and distracts Luke's attention.

35 EXT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE - BACK YARD -- LATE AFTERNOON 35 
     John, Mick and Grace sit in the worn wicker chairs on the                 
     back porch. Erit steps out with beers to replace their
     empties. She sits and they stare off, watching Luke and
     George play with the dog. After a moment Erit looks to John:

 ERIT                   I know you won't want to hear this...


 (CONTINUED) 20. 
35 CONTINUED: 35 
 MICK                   -- Erit, go put somebody to sleep.

     She stares unbelieving, then walks off in a huff.

 JOHN                   Thanks.

 MICK                   Had to be done.
                      (long beat)
                  I am really going to pay for that.

     John has to smile.

36 EXT. THE HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT (DUSK) 36 
     John drives through a rough part of town on their way home.
     He stops at a light and notes the dealers on the corner. A
     flashy car pulls up, hands are slapped; call the driver DAVID.
     He takes a roll of cash from the dealer, looks around, catches
     John staring. John looks away quickly and drives off.

37 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 37 
     John sits at his desk, surrounded by boxes of documents and

38 INT. LARA'S OFFICE - THE PAST -- NIGHT 38 
     Lara and her boss ELIZABETH argue loudly.

39 EXT. PARKING GARAGE - THE PAST -- NIGHT 39 
     It's RAINING outside. ELIZABETH stands at her car door in a
     small, partially covered garage -- maybe a dozen spots. She
     turns toward camera --

     A FIRE EXTINGUISHER comes right at camera, making a terrible
     impact and

     ELIZABETH collapses to the floor.

40 EXT. PARKING GARAGE - THE PAST -- NIGHT 40 
     Lara turns, holding the fire extinguisher.

42 EXT. PARKING LOT - THE PAST -- NIGHT 42 
     Lara's car speeds out of the parking lot. A male co-worker            
     steps out of the rain just as her car passes. He stops as             
     he sees ELIZABETH'S BODY lying beside her car.

43 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - BATHROOM - THE PAST -- DAY 43 
     Lara tries to scrub the blood off of her coat.

44 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 44 
     The phone beside him SHRIEKS.   John picks it up.

45 EXT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ENTRANCE -- NIGHT 45 
     It's late; prime time for the ER.    John runs in.

46 INT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - SEVENTH FLOOR -- NIGHT 46 
     John enters breathlessly and finds the Nurses' Station.

 JOHN                 Lara Brennan; my wife. She was sent                        
                up here. Brennan. B-R-                                     

 DUTY NURSE                     (finds name in roster)                                 
                She can't have visitors.

 JOHN                 That's ridiculous; I have to see                           
                her.

 DUTY NURSE                 I'm sorry.

     John turns away and heads down the corridor to find her
     himself. The Duty Nurse sees this and takes off after him:

 DUTY NURSE (CONT'D)                 You can't go down there!

     John shoves open a door, moves on to the next.

 DUTY NURSE (CONT'D)                 You can't be in here!!

 JOHN                 Lara!

                  I got him!

 JOHN                   Lara!

     A long-haired doctor, BECSEY, steps into his path.

 DR. BECSEY                   What's going on?!

 JOHN                   My wife attempted suicide.

 HOSPITAL GUARD 1 DUTY NURSE        Let's go.                                (hands doctor chart)
                                              She's not allowed visitors.

 JOHN                   I have to see her!

 DR. BECSEY                   Why isn't she in the ER?

 HOSPITAL GUARD 1 DUTY NURSE        I'm not asking. Now.                   She's a transfer from County
                                              Jail.

 JOHN                   Please.   Two minutes.

     Becsey is not unmoved.       He shares a look with the nurse.

47 INT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - PRIVATE ROOM -- NIGHT 47 
     DR. Becsey opens the door for John.          Note a prison guard
     standing outside.

 DR. BECSEY                   Two minutes.

     Becsey leaves. A uniformed female prison guard looks up
     from her magazine and keeps her eyes on John. He looks to
     his wife, who's attached to an I.V. and monitors, pale and
     weak, her arm bandaged where she cut it open along the artery.

     Lara opens her heavy eyelids and John glimpses something
     terrible in her eyes: she's tortured to be alive. He kneels
     beside her and puts a hand on the bed. She takes his little
     finger, wraps her fingers around it.

48 EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FRONT PORCH -- NIGHT 48 
     John opens the door to let Jenna out; she looks considerably
     older.

 JENNA                  I'm sorry. He just keeps pretending
                 he's asleep.

 JOHN                      (reaching for his wallet)                             
                 Don't worry about it.

 JENNA                  It's okay.

 JOHN                  I insist.    I kept you out on a school
                 night.

 JENNA                  I'm not in school anymore.

     She offers a sad smile and leaves without the cash.

49 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 49 
     Luke lies in the crook of his father's arm, his own arms
     full of penguins, turtles, a black dog and an opossum. John
     reads him a letter, the yellow envelope open on the bed.

 JOHN                  And give a big hug to Pengui, Little
                 Pengui, Big Turtley, Little Turtley,
                 Kiki and Opossumy. Lots and lots of
                 love, Mommy.

                 You gonna give them hugs from her?

                 Should we write her back?                                 

 LUKE                  ...When is she coming home?

 JOHN                  Soon honey.    Soon.

 LUKE                      (thinks for a moment, then:)                          
                 Can I have a quarter?

 JOHN                  Can you have a quarter?

     Luke points at the glass coin dish on night stand.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                   Ohhh. Sure, but you can't spend
                  those. They come from the cottage
                  where Mommy and I used to take you
                  when you were a baby.

 LUKE                   Then can I have them all?

 JOHN                   ...Sure.

     He hands Luke the jar, and hoists up him and his animals.

50 INT. LUKE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 50 
     Luke sets the coin jar on his nightstand. John tucks him in
     with his animals, then switches off the lamp. John looks
     back before closing it and watches Luke lie awake, staring
     at the jar, lost in confused thoughts of his mother.

51 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - KITCHEN -- NIGHT 51 
     Dirty dishes piled in the sink, John unloads the dishwasher.
     He finds the handle has cracked off Luke's favorite mug. He
     places the cup and handle on the counter, opens a drawer
     crammed with tools and screws and tape and such. He rummages
     through it. Not finding what he is looking for, he pulls
     handfuls of junk out of the drawer and slams it all down on
     the counter. The harder he searches the more he becomes
     frustrated, until he slams the drawer and leans on the
     counter, feeling destroyed and needy.

     And then a female hand appears beside him, opens another
     drawer and reaches in. John stares at the hand, afraid to
     move, afraid to look up. The hand finds a tube of glue,
     places it on the counter and moves away.

     John turns to see LARA walking away. She turns, smiling and
     shaking her head, and disappears into the dining room.

     Stunned, John looks down at the glue on the counter, then
     suddenly pushes away and rushes into the dining room. No
     sign of her. And she isn't in the living room. He bolts
     into the foyer and finds the front door slightly ajar. He
     flings it open...

52 EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- NIGHT 52 
     John rushes out into the street, looking up and down for her --
     finally realizing she was never there.

     He stands in the middle of the street, now searching for some
     way to survive.

53 INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - JOHN'S CLASSROOM -- DAY 53 
     Don Quixote is written on the chalkboard.

 JOHN                   So, what is it about?   Julie?

 JULIE                   That belief in someone's virtue is
                  more important than virtue itself?

 JOHN                   No. I mean, yes, that's in there.
                  But what is it about?

     No takers.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                   It is about how rational thought
                  destroys the soul. It is about the
                  triumph of irrationality, and the
                  power that is in it.

54 INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - LIBRARY -- DAY 54 
     John drops an armload of books into a library cart, each
     having something to do with prison or prison life.

     He sits at a table at the back, flipping through them one at
     a time and discards each in turn.

     As the shadows grow longer we find him staring at the computer
     screen linked to the school system.

     ON THE SCREEN: a book summary disappears, to be replaced by
     the school search engine -- many of the items have already
     been inspected. John finds one that reads "Over The Walls."              

     He clicks on the link and the title page appears. The author
     is DAMON PENNINGTON. There's a photo of him. The caption
     reads that he LIVES IN BROOKLYN, NY.

55 EXT. BROOKLYN, NEW YORK - STREET -- DAY 55 
     John gets out of a cab and heads into a local dive bar.

56 INT. BAR -- DAY 56 
     A couple of guys at the bar yell at the dog race on the TV               
     screen. DAMON hands John a beer and nods toward a table.

 JOHN                   It's a course that investigates what
                  drives men to be free, no matter the
                  cost.

 DAMON                   Somebody else had dibs on Papillon?

 JOHN                   You escaped from jail seven times.                           

     Damon lights a cigarette.       A TOUGH GUY nearby objects.

 TOUGH GUY                   No smoking!!

 DAMON                   Yeah, who would want to cut short
                  your precious life?

     Damon takes a deep drag.

 JOHN                   Mind if I tape you?

 DAMON                   Go for it, it can't be used as
                  evidence. What do you want to know?

     John sets up the small digital recorder.

 JOHN                   How you escaped when no one else
                  could.

 DAMON                   Balls and a little luck.
                      (beat)
                  No prison in the world is airtight.
                  Each one has a key. You have to
                  find it.

 JOHN                   How do you do that?

 DAMON                   A lot of looking. Especially at
                  things that break the daily routine.
                  Guards get comfortable doing the
                  same thing every day. Something
                  happens where they have to think,
                  adapt.

 DAMON (CONT'D)                   That's when they will make mistakes.
                  But when you see it you have to be
                  ready. You have to have the entire
                  plan already in place before you
                  even know how you are going to get
                  out of the jail.
                  Escaping is easy; the hardest part
                  is staying free.

57 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 57 
     The tape recorder plays Damon's voice; John tears large sheets
     of art paper from a pad and tacks them to his bedroom wall.

 DAMON (O.S.)                   You have to know where you are going
                  to go and how you are going to get
                  there. You have to know how they
                  plan to catch you, where, and when.

 JOHN (O.S.)                   How the hell do you know that?

     He starts to write on the paper with a large felt marker.

 DAMON (O.S.)                   You pay off someone who knows. And
                  a lot depends on if the prison is in
                  the country or the city.

58 INT. BAR -- DAY 58 
 JOHN                   The city.

     That came out too quickly. Damon now understands. John
     sits, silent, knowing he blew it. Damon takes his time.

 DAMON                   Where are you from?

 JOHN                   ...Pittsburgh.

 DAMON                   Pittsburgh is tough; so many bridges
                  and tunnels they can block off.

                  minutes.

61 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 61 
     John draws a circle on the wall and writes in it: 15 MINUTES --

 DAMON (O.S.)                   Within thirty-five minutes they will
                  have cops at every tollbooth on the

 DAMON                   And be running rolling stops on the

 JOHN                   Thirty-five minutes isn't a lot of

     John writes DESCRIPTION at the end of one spoke.

 DAMON (O.S.)                   Stay far away from the train and bus

 DAMON                   Second: identity. It's easy to find
                  fake papers, harder to find ones

69 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 69 
     John writes "IDENTITIES."

 DAMON (O.S.)                   You'll need a passport, driver's
                  license and a social security number.

70 INT. BAR -- DAY 70 
 DAMON                   If you have to rent a car, find a

     John's writes "MONEY."

 DAMON (O.S.)                   You need a truck load of it.
                  Everything's expensive: hotels,
                  travel, information.

74 INT. BAR -- DAY 74 
 JOHN                   How much?

 DAMON                   Enough to last at least five-six
                  years. Run out of money and you run
                  out of friends.

75 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 75 
     John underlines "MONEY."

76 INT. BAR -- DAY 76 
     John is starting to understand the enormity of this
     undertaking.

 DAMON                   But before you do anything, you have
                  to ask yourself if you can do it.
                  Can you forget about ever seeing
                  your parents again. Can you kill a
                  guard, leave your kid at a gas
                  station, push a nice old lady to the
                  ground because she is between you
                  and the door? Because to do this
                  thing, that's who you have to become.
                  And if you can't, don't start, because
                  you'll just get someone killed.

78 INT. BAR -- DAY 78 
 DAMON                 I gave myself up. I couldn't take
                wondering when someone was going to

     twenty.                                                                

79 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 79 
     On the wall we see the massive diagram John has created.
     The screen goes BLACK. Read:

 THE LAST THREE MONTHS 
80 EXT. T-TRAIN -- DAY 80 
     The train crosses a bridge.

81 INT. T-TRAIN -- CONTINUOUS 81 
     John rides, looking down at the river below.

82 INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- DAY 82 
     John steps through the puffer (the machine that detects drugs)
     and into the secure area. He makes a mental note of
     everything he sees: the number of guards, cameras, etc.

83 EXT. COUNTY JAIL - DELIVERY AREA -- DAY 83 
     John sits in his car on the road above, surreptitiously taking
     pictures of the vehicles coming and going from the prison.
 32. 


84 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 84 
     He tapes the photos to the wall.

85 INT. COUNTY JAIL -- DAY 85 
     Walking down a corridor with the other visitors, John steps
     in a puddle of water. Behind him the others notice and step
     around it. Moving on, they pass a trustee on a ladder pulling
     a water-stained ceiling tile away as two guards watch.

86 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 86 
     John traces a route on a map with a highlighter.

87 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- DAY (NEW DAY) 87 
     The wall grows thick with photos and notes.

88 INT. CLASSROOM -- NEW DAY 88 
     He reads an article on his computer -- about illegal aliens
     and fake ID's.

89 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 89 
     John enters his bedroom and closes the door. We see how
     dramatically his plan has evolved on the wall as every inch
     is covered in notes, photos, maps, and various writings. He
     studies it as he bites into a sandwich.

90 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR -- DAY 90 
     John and Luke walk near the front of the group of visitors
     toward the visitation rooms.

     Just ahead he notices a guard using a key to call the
     elevator. John stops near the elevator and kneels, pulling
     one of Luke's shoelaces loose.

 LUKE                 It was already tied.

     John reties the lace as the group moves on.    He keeps one
     eye on the elevator.

     The door opens and the guard   steps in - and John notices two
     WORKMEN in hardhats inside.    The elevator closes, the shoelace
     is tied, the group has moved   on down the hall and they are
     alone. John pulls the laces    and unties Luke's shoe.

 LUKE (CONT'D)                 You untied it again!                                           

 (CONTINUED) 33. 
90 CONTINUED: 90 
     The guard looks back, now impatient. John offers a smile
     and throws a look down at the elevator tread, sees the name:
     OTIS ELEVATOR COMPANY. Suddenly a voice comes from behind:

 WOMAN'S VOICE                   Mr. Brennan?

     Startled, John turns to see DR. LIFSON.

 DR. LIFSON                   We met briefly. Byrdie Lifson.

 JOHN                   Oh, sorry.    Hello, Doctor.

 DR. LIFSON                       (to approaching guard)
                  I'll bring them back myself.                              

91 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CLINIC -- DAY 91 
     John leaves Luke playing and steps into the office. Lifson             
     partially closes the door, so John can still see his son.              

 DR. LIFSON                   We check your wife's blood regularly.
                  She's been refusing her insulin. I
                  don't want to sound dramatic, but
                  it's just another form of suicide.

 JOHN                   I'll talk to her.

 DR. LIFSON                   If she doesn't --                                         

 JOHN                   I'll talk to her.                                         
                      (steps out)                                           
                  Let's go, Squirrel.                                       

92 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTACT VISITING ROOM -- DAY 92 
     John and Luke wait. The prisoners enter.      Lara looks
     terrible. John stands and embraces her.

 JOHN                   Hey. Are you alright?                                     

 LARA                   I'm fine.    I'm fine.



 (CONTINUED) 34. 
92 CONTINUED: 92 
     Lara smiles to cover and bends down and kisses her son, who
     is engrossed in his toys as usual.

 LARA (CONT'D)                   Hi, sweet potato. How are you doing?

     He doesn't respond. She kisses him on the head then takes a
     seat. John sits beside her. They speak in whispers.

 JOHN                   The doctor told me about the insulin.

 LARA                       (watching Luke)
                  Yeah, I forgot. It's no big deal.

 JOHN                   You forgot?    For how many days?

 LARA                   I forgot, okay? I have things on my
                  mind.

 JOHN                   --And so much to do.

 LARA                   Oh, that's nice.

 JOHN                   Why are you doing this?

 LARA                   Can I please just watch him play?
                  Tell me about kindergarten.

 JOHN                   No.   I need you to --

 LARA                   Fine, I won't forget again, okay?
                      (trying to fight away these
                       thoughts:)
                  I am just never going to walk him to
                  school or wash his clothes or make
                  him dinner...and I don't know how I
                  can live knowing that. Okay?

 JOHN                   Lara. Look at me. Something will
                  happen. I promise.



 (CONTINUED) 35. 
92 CONTINUED: (2) 92 
 LARA                       (cruelly - but hushed)
                  What? What is going to happen?
                  There are no more appeals, there are
                  no more anything. Exactly what
                  miracle are we hoping for, John?

     He looks down, beaten.      She lets go of her anger.

 LARA (CONT'D)                   I need you to do something for me.

 JOHN                   Sure.

 LARA                   Stop bringing him.                                         

 JOHN                   Come on...

 LARA                   He hates coming here.   Look at him.

 JOHN                   Lara....

 LARA                   Please. It's not his fault. It's                           
                  too hard to watch him forget me.

     John looks at his son, playing at a distance, his back to
     them. It's hard to argue with her, she's right.

 LARA (CONT'D)                   You want to hear something funny?

 JOHN                   Yes.    Anything.

 LARA                   My mother tried to send me anti-aging
                  cream.

     John smiles, but like hers it may be the saddest smile in
     the world. They sit and watch Luke play.

93 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 93 
     John checks his bank statements and adds them up on the wall
     under MONEY. The total is $8,840.00.

     He stares at that figure for a moment.
 36. 


94 INT. REALTOR'S OFFICE -- DAY 94 
     EUGENIE, the REAL ESTATE AGENT, walks John to the door.

 EUGENIE                 You're sure that you don't want a
                lawn sign?

 JOHN                 I'm very sure. Thanks.                                      

95 INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - LIBRARY -- DAY 95 
     A STUDENT shows John how to use Photoshop to enlarge and
     crop a photo.

96 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON 96 
     John uses Photoshop, looking through family pictures for an
     appropriate one to use for Lara's ID. Some of them are of
     the family at a cottage. He finds one that will work and
     starts to crop himself and Luke (as a baby) out of the photo.
     Then he turns and notices Luke standing behind him, staring
     at the screen.

97 EXT. PITTSBURGH -- DAY 97 
     A helicopter swoops over a bridge and traces the Monongahela
     River through the city. On the door of the helicopter is
     emblazoned the name of a local tour company.

98 INT. HELICOPTER -- DAY 98 
     John sits among six other passengers.

 COPTER PILOT                 On the left, Allegheny County Jail.
                Built in 1995, it is now the largest                        
                jail in the world. There have been                          
                three escape attempts. No one's                             
                made it out alive. On your right...                         

     Everyone else looks to the right as the pilot continues.
     John stays fixed on the left window.

 HIS POINT OF VIEW: 
     The massive rooftops of the jail. But then he sees exactly
     what he is looking for: workmen wearing yellow helmets spread
     hot tar and roofing paper. He spots a workman carrying a
     bucket heading around a tall outcropping on the roof.
 37. 


99 INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - CLASSROOM -- DAY 99 
      LYLA, a student, reads from The Idiot as John returns to his
      desk with papers in his hands. His laptop lies open to Google
      Earth -- the rooftop view of the jail, from another angle.
      John closes it and spreads the papers on his desk -- a printed
      color version of the same. He draws an arrow to the
      outcropping where we now see a door; labels it ELEVATOR.

 LYLA                  On the first landing, which was as
                 small as the necessary turn of the
                 stairs allowed, there was a niche in
                 the column, about a yard wide, and
                 in this niche the prince felt
                 convinced that a man stood concealed.
                 He thought he could distinguish a
                 figure standing there.

100 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- DAY 100 
      John searches Craigslist for HELICOPTER PILOTS. Clicks on
      one that reads EXPERIENCED HELICOPTER PILOT, COMBAT VET,
 WILL CONSIDER ANY OFFER. 
 ANGLE ON JOHN'S WALL 
      Where a magazine clipping of a helicopter sits under the
      heading ESCAPE. Overlapping it he pins trimmed print-outs
      of several PILOT candidates.

      Directly underneath is the Google Earth photo of the rooftop
      of the jail, the door marked with an arrow, and the landing
      site indicated with an X in a circle.

      Below that is a rough sketch of the visitor's room and the
      adjacent corridor with an arrow marking the elevator. In
      block letters beside it is the word "KEY?"

101 INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT 101 
      Luke, John and George stand in the foyer, Luke with his child-
      sized, brightly-colored overnight bag. John pulls off Luke's
      coat, kisses him on the head and looks up at George.

 JOHN                  Thanks.

      George nods, takes Luke's hand and walks to the kitchen.
 38. 


102 EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT 102 
      John drives, taking note of the corners where young men hang
      out, selling drugs or contraband.

103 EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT 103 
      John walks up to a guy leaning on the bumper of his car, the            
      trunk partially open. Call him MOUSS.                                   

 JOHN                  Adderall?

 MOUSS                  Ten apiece, five for forty.

      John hands him a twenty, Mouss digs into a bag in his trunk             
      and hands him a blister-pack strip of two pills, samples.               

 JOHN                  I need some passports.

 MOUSS                  Piss off.

      John nods and walks back across the street.   The guy watches.

104 INT. CAR -- NIGHT 104 
      John climbs into his car and tosses the pills onto the
      passenger seat, among a half dozen others. There is a sharp
      RAP on his window; Mouss. John rolls down the window.

 MOUSS                  You have to pay up front.

 JOHN                  I can do that.

 MOUSS                  You know the Uptown on 5th Ave?

 JOHN                  No.

 MOUSS                  Ask for Harv.

 JOHN                  What's your name?

 MOUSS                  Just say Mouss.
 39. 


105 EXT. UPTOWN LOUNGE - 5TH AVENUE -- NIGHT 105 
      John parks and steps out of his car.

106 INT. UPTOWN LOUNGE -- NIGHT 106 
      Hip-hop blares, the clientele are low-lives, John doesn't
      exactly fit in as he enters and orders. His words are drowned
      out. The bartender gives him a beer on tap. John asks for
      "Hart." The bartender nods to a man at the back who is
      playing a video game. John walks off, passing a LONG-HAIRED             
      GUY at the bar who watches him. John approaches HARV.                   

 JOHN                  Mouss said to come see you.

 HARV                  He did, did he? What do you want?                            

 JOHN                  Three passports, a driver's license,
                 and real social security number.

 HARV                  How do you know Mouss?

 JOHN                  He babysits my kid.

 HARV                      (sizes him up, then:)                                    
                 Okay.                                                        

      Harv gives him a look; nods for him to follow.                          

107 EXT. HILL DISTRICT - PARKING LOT BEHIND BAR -- NIGHT 107 
      They step out the back door.

 HARV                  You have the photos on you?

 JOHN                  Yes.   How much?

 HARV                  Fifteen hundred.

      MOUSS steps out of the shadows and cracks John across the
      back of the head with a pipe. John stumbles to the ground.

      The two men kick the shit out of John.   John tries to protect
      his face; they just keep kicking.

 (CONTINUED) WHITE 9-10-09 40. 
107 CONTINUED: 107 
      Mouss finally grabs John's hair and flicks a knife in his
      face as Harv searches his pockets and finds his money.

 MOUSS                    I ever see you again, you lose an                            
                   eye.                                                         

      The two men walk away and get into Mouss' van. John lies
      doubled up on the ground and eventually tries to stand.

108 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - BATHROOM -- NIGHT 108 
      John cleans the cuts on his face with peroxide, adds a Band-
      Aid. He stares at his face, letting defeat wash over him.

109 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 109 
      John deducts $2,000 from the MONEY column.

110 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- MORNING 110 
      His face purple with bruises, John pulls himself out of bed
      in response to the RINGING DOORBELL.

111 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FOYER -- CONTINUOUS 111 
      John limps to the front door and opens it to see Eugenie,
      his realtor, standing with a nice couple. They see his face,
      try and hide their reactions.

 EUGENIE                    You did remember I was showing the
                   house?

 JOHN                    Give me two minutes.

112 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS 112 
      John tacks two large dark blue sheets up over the wall,
      covering his plan.

113 EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FRONT PORCH -- CONTINUOUS 113 
      Eugenie reassures her skittish clients.

 EUGENIE                    It really is a great neighborhood.

114 INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- DAY 114 
      Grace, John's mother, opens the door and sees John's face.


 (CONTINUED) 41. 
114 CONTINUED: 114 
 GRACE                    Oh, my lord!     What happened?

115 INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S KITCHEN -- DAY 115 
      John sits as Grace approaches with iodine and cotton balls.
      Through the window he sees Luke playing with the dog.

 JOHN                    It was stupid, I fell off the bike.

 GRACE                    The bike that's been in our garage
                   for two years? Put your head back.

 JOHN                    Some guy made a crack about Lara.

 GRACE                    So, that's what you do now: punch
                   everyone who thinks she's guilty?

 JOHN                    What's that supposed to mean?

 GRACE                    It means it's important what YOU
                   believe, not --

 JOHN                    Really?   So, what do you believe,
                   Mom?

      John stands and opens the back door.

 GRACE                    Why are you trying to start a fight?

 JOHN                        (calling out back door)
                   Come on, buddy!
                       (to his mother)
                   Where is his bag?

 GRACE                    Why are you doing this?!

      Luke enters as Grace tries to hide her tears.

 JOHN                    No reason. I just stupidly thought
                   people who loved her would actually
                   believe she's innocent. My mistake.

 (CONTINUED) 42. 
115 CONTINUED: 115 
 GRACE                    Stop this!

      John turns and sees GEORGE standing in the open doorway. He
      has heard everything. He gives his son a dismissive look
      and walks off towards his bedroom. John feels like a heel.

 JOHN                        (to Luke)
                   Give Grandma a kiss.

      Luke does, and the two of them leave with his bag.

116 EXT. GRACE & GEORGE'S - INSIDE THE PRIUS -- DAY 116 
      John gets in and checks his mirror.   Luke is staring at him.           

 LUKE                    Does your face hurt?

 JOHN                    A little.

 LUKE                    Did you hit him back?

 JOHN                    No.

 LUKE                    That's okay.

      John pulls away.                                                        

117 EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT 117 
      John drives, looking for someone selling fake papers. He
      sees Mouss' parked car and slows; Mouss stares at him. John             
      flashes his middle finger and drives on. Mouss considers                
      doing something but just flips him off.

118 EXT. HILL DISTRICT - ANOTHER INTERSECTION -- NIGHT 118 
      John asks a couple of guys on the corner about papers and is
      turned away. As he returns to his car, he doesn't notice
      MIKE, the long-haired guy from Drake's Bar, watching from
      astride his motorcycle. A SECOND RIDER pulls up beside Mike.
      John pulls out and the motorcycles follow at a distance.

119 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- NIGHT 119 
      John watches Jenna leave; closes the door, climbs the stairs.
 43. 


120 INT. LUKE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 120 
      John sees Luke sleeping, surrounded by his animals.       The
      doorbell rings.

121 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- NIGHT 121 
      John peers out surreptitiously, sees MIKE standing there.                    
      He rings the bell again.                                                     

      John runs and snatches a kitchen knife, returns to the door,
      secures the chain lock and opens the door a crack.

 JOHN                  What?

      Mike speaks in a loud, atonal and unnerving voice.

 MIKE                  I was at the bar.    I know what you
                 are looking for.

      Caught off guard by the voice, John just stares at him.

 MIKE (CONT'D)                  I'm deaf, you idiot. I read lips.

      John stares at him, unsure what to do.

 MIKE (CONT'D)                  You really want to talk out here?

      John puts the knife in his back pocket and steps out onto...

122 EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FRONT PORCH -- CONTINUOUS 122 
      John tries to look tough.     Mike smiles at John's bravado.

 MIKE                  What do you need?

      John indicates Mike should lower his voice.

 JOHN                  Three passports, a driver's license
                 and social security number that can
                 take a credit check.

 MIKE                  Thirty seven hundred.

 JOHN                  That's too much.

 MIKE                    It is if you never get them. I need
                   photos and a thousand in advance.

      John stares at the man, trying to read him.       He turns.

123 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - KITCHEN 123 
      John pulls cash and an envelope from his jacket pocket.

124 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FOYER -- NIGHT 124 
      Mike counts the money and shoves it in his breast pocket.

 MIKE                    I'll bring them Wednesday.

 JOHN                    Not here.   Don't come here again.

      Mike stares at him.      John stares back.

 MIKE                    Parking lot of Don's. Eckert Street.
                   Under the bridge; two o'clock. If
                   I'm not there on time, leave.

      John closes the door behind him and watches Mike walk off
      toward his motorcycle.

125 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - KITCHEN 125 
      He drops the carving knife back in the drawer. As he looks
      up, he sees THE SECOND RIDER staring in the window, his helmet
      still on. John's heart almost stops. The rider DRIVES OFF.

126 EXT. STREET - UNDER A BRIDGE -- DAY 126 
      A beat-up old van sits parked on the crumbling sidewalk.                   
      John hands seven hundred dollars to a sketchy-looking guy                  
      inside. The guy hands John a 9MM handgun wrapped in a                      
      oilcloth. John unwraps it and hands it back.                               

 JOHN                    Show me how to load it.

127 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - KITCHEN -- EVENING 127 
      John and Luke enter the back door. Luke automatically heads
      for the living room. John calls after him:

 JOHN                    No video game.

 LUKE (O.S.)                    Dad!

      John moves to check the answering machine.

 JOHN                    I'll play checkers with you after
                   dinner.

 LUKE (O.S.)                    You'll just lose again.

 EUGENIE (V.O.)                        (on voicemail:)
                   John? It's Eugenie. You're not
                   going to believe it; the people I
                   brought over? They made an offer!
                   I'll bring it in the morning.

 BEEP. 
 JOHN                        (buoyed/to Luke)
                   Not tonight. Tonight, I utterly                            
                   destroy you.                                               

128 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 128 
      John watches a video on YouTube: "How to unlock any door."
      The person on screen demonstrates how to make a "bump key."

 KID ON SCREEN                    -- a bump key. First, find any key                         
                   that fits into the same make of lock.                      

129 INT. BRENNAN'S GARAGE -- NIGHT 129 
      John files down a key, held in the jaws of a vice.                      

130 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - BACK DOOR -- NIGHT 130 
      John inserts the bump key into the door lock, bumps it with
      the butt of a screwdriver. The key won't turn.

131 INT. BRENNAN'S GARAGE -- NIGHT 131 
      He files down the key some more.

132 EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - BACK PORCH -- NIGHT 132 
      He inserts the key, bumps it, turns.     The lock opens.

133 INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - ELEVATOR -- DAY 133 
      John gets in, heading up to his classroom. People avoid
      looking at his face. One woman can't help noticing. John
      nods and smiles. He pushes the elevator button and notices
      the name: OTIS ELEVATOR COMPANY.

134 INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- DAY 134 
      John scans the room as he waits. Two children play in the
      set that is used to teach them how to speak to a prisoner
      behind glass using a phone. A moment later, a woman enters
      with a large shoulder bag. She is a NOTARY.

 NOTARY                  Mr. Brennan?

135 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTACT VISITING ROOM -- MORNING 135 
      No other visitors today.     A NOTARY sits with Lara and John.

 NOTARY                  And just put your thumb there.

      And Lara puts her thumb print on the book.

 NOTARY (CONT'D)                  Thanks, that's all I need.

      The notary heads for the door.     John turns to the female
      guard who is waiting.

 JOHN                  I'll just be a moment.

      He turns back to his wife.

 LARA                      (touching him, melting)
                 Your poor face. How could you do
                 that to yourself?

 JOHN                  I am useless without you.    I can't
                 even ride a bike.

 LARA                  I think it's very sexy.

 JOHN                  I'm sorry we had to do this.



 (CONTINUED) 47. 
135 CONTINUED: 135 
 LARA                    You have nothing to apologize for.
                   But you should have told me before
                   this.

 JOHN                    I know.

 LARA                    I don't want you not telling me
                   things.

 JOHN                    From now on I will.

 LARA                        (beat)
                   I won't know where to picture you.
                       (off his look)
                   I close my eyes and I see Luke in
                   his bedroom, you on the sofa by the
                   Window. I won't know where to picture
                   you anymore.

136 INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - JOHN'S CLASSROOM -- DAY 136 
      John stares at his laptop as the class does a test. Knowing
      he isn't paying attention, a STUDENT angles his multiple
      choice test so that his friend behind can see the answers.

137 INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - CORRIDOR -- DAY 137 
      John waits for the janitor to leave his tiny office and grabs
      the door before it closes. He slips inside and finds a rack
      with keys. He takes one from the hook marked ELEVATORS.

138 INT. BRENNAN'S GARAGE -- NIGHT 138 
      John files down the elevator key as he did the house key.

139 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - GARAGE -- DAY 139 
      John moves aside a box on the shelf and removes the handgun,
      wrapped in an old chamois.

 PAULA (O.S.)                    John?

      He turns to see Paula standing in the open garage door.

 JOHN                    Hi.


 (CONTINUED) 48. 
139 CONTINUED: 139 
      John tries to look casual as he stands with the thinly
      disguised gun in his hand.

 PAULA                    I was wondering if I could ask you
                   to water my plants next week; I'm
                   going in for an operation.

 JOHN                    I hope it's nothing serious.

 PAULA                    My idiot doctor misdiagnosed me.
                   He's blaming the lab; the lab's
                   blaming him. But I'll be fine.
                   Thanks.

      And she walks off.    John gets in the car and slips the gun
      between the seats.

140 INT. PRIUS -- DAY 140 
      John pulls into the empty parking lot beside Don's and waits.
      Checks his watch: 1:49 PM. A car pulls in. The guy sits
      there for a second, then gets out and enters the restaurant.

141 INT. PRIUS -- DAY 141 
      John checks his watch. 2:14. He looks around, knowing he
      is supposed to leave. He makes a call.

 RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)                    English Department, this is Catherine.

 JOHN                    Hi. It's John. Luke isn't feeling
                   well, I'm going to take him home. I
                   need Carl to cover my 2:30 class.

 RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)                    I will let him know.

142 INT. PRIUS - DON'S PARKING LOT - MANCHESTER -- AFTERNOON 142 
      John checks his watch: 2:27. His cell phone rings, displays
      the name MICK; John presses IGNORE. He feels for the gun                    
      between the seats.

143 EXT. DON'S PARKING LOT - MANCHESTER -- AFTERNOON 143 
      The guy comes out of the restaurant. John watches him walk
      to his car. The man sees him and stares back. John checks
      his watch. 2:45. The guy drives off, leaving the lot empty.

 (CONTINUED) 49. 
143 CONTINUED: 143 
      John presses the VOICEMAIL button on his phone.

 MICK (V.O.)                    Are you ever going to answer your
                   goddamn phone?

      Suddenly a man in a helmet raps on his side window and John
      realizes MIKE has pulled up without him noticing. His hand
      goes to the split between the seats, but stops short as the
      SECOND RIDER pulls up to the passenger window.

 MIKE                    You were supposed to leave.

 JOHN                    I need them.

 MIKE                    You notice that guy was a cop?

 JOHN                    Which guy?

 MIKE                    The one with the red light in his
                   back window.

      John feels ridiculous.       Mike hands him the documents.

 MIKE (CONT'D)                    Just give me the money.

      John hands him the envelope of money.       Mike checks it.

 MIKE (CONT'D)                    You want this too much. You're going
                   to fuck it up.

      Mike speeds off. The second rider gives John a look and
      follows. John looks over the passports with their new names.

144 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - GARAGE -- AFTERNOON 144 
      Luke gets out of the car and heads into the house, swinging
      his lunch pale. John watches him go, then reaches down beside
      his seat and pulls out the gun, wrapped in a cloth. He hides
      it in the garage and thinks about what he is doing.

145 INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- DAY 145 
      John moves through the line toward the metal detector. He
      takes his key ring out of his pocket and slips it, and the
      separate elevator bump key, into a white plastic dish and

 (CONTINUED) 50. 
145 CONTINUED: 145 
      places it atop the X-ray machine. He steps through the metal
      detector and then grabs the plastic dish before the guard can
      get to it. He hands the dish to the guard.

 JOHN                    How are you doing today?

 GUARD                    Don't touch that.

 JOHN                    Sorry.

      John puts the dish down, and we see the bump key is gone --
      John palmed it. The guard dumps John's key ring on the
      counter with the keys and cell phones from the other visitors.

      JOHN pockets the palmed key as he enters the jail.

146 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR -- DAY 146 
      John moves down the hall with the fifty or so other visitors.
      He eases toward the elevator, keeping his eye on the guard
      ahead. By the time the group stops for the door ahead to
      open, John's managed to be right beside the elevator.

      He folds his coat over his arm to block others from seeing
      and feels for the slot. Finding it, he slips in the bump
      key. It fits.

      The guard at the lead opens the door to the first visiting
      room and the crowd starts moving again. John quickly bumps
      the key and turns it -- but it won't turn. He bumps it again.
      Visitors keep moving past him.

      He looks over his shoulder, sees the guard following them is
      preoccupied at the door.

      He turns it harder. Nothing.     He tries to pull it out.
      It's stuck. John panics.

      The rear guard closes the entry door and follows the crowd.

      John tugs at it one last time, and then turns it hard and
      snaps it off in the lock. A BLACK WOMAN among the visitors
      sees what he is doing but averts her eyes.

      John drops the rest of the broken key and kicks it into the
      slot between the elevator and the shaft. He slips back into
      the crowd and moves on.

      Near the rear of the crowd now, John approaches the door to
      the visiting room.

 (CONTINUED) WHITE 9-10-09 51. 
146 CONTINUED: 146 
      He throws a look back, sees another guard step up and try to
      insert his key in the elevator.

      John rounds the corner into the visiting room. The camera
      stays on his face until we finally hear A DEAFENING ALARM.

147 INT. COUNTY JAIL - ANOTHER CORRIDOR -- DAY 147 
      John waits in a line against the wall, beside a door to a
      small office. Through the glass he watches the MAJOR
      interview the black woman who noticed what he was doing.
      She nods and leaves, passing him with a look. The Major
      holds the door open for him.

148 INT. MAJOR'S OFFICE -- A SHORT TIME LATER 148 
      The MAJOR plays John the CCTV video from the corridor. He
      flips between two camera positions at either end of the hall.
      The crowd of visitors shuffling toward the visiting rooms
      obscures the view of the elevator.

 MAJOR                    So, you are where in here?

 JOHN                    ...In the middle there.

 MAJOR                    In the middle. Can you point to
                   yourself?

 JOHN                        (looks)
                   It's hard to tell.   I think that's
                   me there. Why?

      He freezes the tape and points to a blurry figure in the
      background.

 MAJOR                    So that's not you there.   By the
                   elevator?

 JOHN                        (looks)
                   ....No.
                       (points to another person)
                   I was over here. You want to tell
                   me what's going on?

 MAJOR                    You want me to tell you?


 (CONTINUED) 52. 
148 CONTINUED: 148 
 JOHN                    Yes.

      The Major holds the piece of the key that jammed in the lock.

 MAJOR                    You know what a bump key is?

 JOHN                    Sorry.

      Major puts it on the desk and just stares at John.    Finally:

 MAJOR                    If this was you, you might want to
                   think about what's going to happen
                   to your kids if both of their parents
                   are in prison.

      The major stares right through him.

149 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR -- DAY 149 
      John heads toward the exit, accompanied by a guard. As he
      nears the elevator he sees a technician climbing a step
      ladder, holding a new CCTV camera.

150 INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- DAY 150 
      Face chalk white, John heads for the exit, fighting the urge
      to run. The door opens just before he gets there and Collero
      steps in, Quinn holding the door for her. John charges past,
      noticing neither of them -- but Quinn recognizes him. Quinn
      turns and watches as John doubles over the short wall nearby
      and vomits.

 DETECTIVE COLLERO                    -- The worst date you've ever been
                   on? This was worse. And this guy?                           
                   He really thinks he is doing great.                         
                   Then he's driving me home and I know                        
                   he's going to try and kiss me, so I
                   pretend to fall asleep. I mean, I'm
                   actually snoring, right in his car.                         
                   Does that stop him?                                         

      John turns and notices Quinn, behind the door, watching him.
      They lock eyes. Collero realizes that Quinn isn't paying
      attention and wonders what he's looking at.

 DETECTIVE COLLERO (CONT'D)                    ...What?


 (CONTINUED) 53.

      John turns and walks away.     Quinn keeps watching.

 DETECTIVE QUINN                    Did I tell you not to date cops?

      Collero's eyes find John as well.      He disappears around the
      corner.

151 INT. T-TRAIN -- DAY 151 
      John rides home, devastated that his plan has failed, and
      wondering what he will do. He checks over his shoulder to
      make sure he isn't being followed.

152 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- DAY 152 
      John sits on the bare wood floor of the living room. His
      head turns as he hears someone POUNDING on the front door.
      He throws a look to the garage, thinks about the gun;
      dismisses the idea. Then he hears the voice: his brother.

 MICK (O.S.)                    Let me in, asshole!!

153 EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FRONT PORCH -- CONTINUOUS 153 
      Mick bangs again.                                                          

 MICK (O.S.)                    Open up!
                       (more banging)
                   Your car is in the garage, I know
                   you're in there!

154 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 154 
      John doesn't move. As we pull back we see that the living
      room and dining room have been stripped of every bit of
      furniture, save an old TV set sitting on a box. John knows
      he can't let his brother see this.

      The MALE NEIGHBOR in the house to the south opens his door
      and looks out and scowls.

 MALE NEIGHBOR                    What's your problem? He's not home!

 MICK                    Not home?   So you're saying I'm blind?

 MALE NEIGHBOR                    No, I'm saying you're an idiot.


 (CONTINUED) 54. 
154 CONTINUED: 154 
      Mick pounds on the door aggressively.      Then just gives up.                

 MICK                    You know what? You're right.    I am
                   an idiot.

      And he walks off to his car.

155 EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 155 
      John leans back against the wall, in the middle of the bare
      room, and listens to his brother's car start and drive away.

156 OMITTED 156 AND AND 157 157 
158 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- EVENING 158 
      John stands, staring at his wall, now a vast collage, layer
      upon layer of photographs and notes. And no answers.

 LUKE (O.S.)                    ...Dad?

159 EXT. PARK -- DAY 159 
      John sits on a bench, frustrated and lost.      Luke trots up.

 LUKE                    Can I have my cookies?

 JOHN                    You hungry?    You want your sandwich?

 LUKE                    No.

      John hands him two packaged cookies. Luke runs off and hands
      them to Carrie. Her attractive young mother, Nicole, sitting
      a couple of benches down, calls and draws John's attention.

 NICOLE                    Carrie!
                       (to John)
                   I'm sorry. She just already has it
                   all figured out.
                       (John nods awkwardly)
                   Nicole.

 JOHN                    I remember.

 NICOLE                        (knows he doesn't)
                   Really?

 JOHN                        (smiles and admits)
                   I remember your daughter.

 NICOLE                    She's hard to forget.
                       (digs in her bag)
                   Oh, this is for you. Luke was
                   supposed to bring it home.

      Hands him an envelope. He opens it and sees a birthday
      invitation with jungle animals on the cover.

 JOHN                    He has his father's memory.

 NICOLE                    It's for Carrie's birthday party.                              
                   Please come; I'd love to meet your                             
                   wife.

 JOHN                    I'm afraid she can't be there.
                   ...It's complicated.

 NICOLE                    I understand. With me, too. Carrie,
                   come on, time for lunch.
                       (to John)
                   We're going to the cafe on the corner,
                   would you like to join us?

 JOHN                    Oh, we're pretty...you know....

 NICOLE                    Busy?

      John smiles, busted.

 NICOLE (CONT'D)                    Come on, we owe you for the cookies.

 JOHN                    That's true.     And I made those
                   cookies.

 NICOLE                    And learned how to pre-package them.

 JOHN                    Which requires a considerable amount
                   of machinery. Come on, Luke.

      They walk toward the street, the kids trailing behind.
      Neither John nor Nicole speak for a moment.

 NICOLE                    Do you trade off time with Luke?

 JOHN                    No. Luke and I are together full
                   time.

 NICOLE                    Wow. I guess that's why I see you
                   so much.

 JOHN                    She'd like nothing better than to be
                   here. With him. Lara. She really
                   misses...all this.

 NICOLE                    I guess it's all about priorities,
                   isn't it?

 JOHN                    No.  She's not like that.   She'd...
                       (has to admit)
                   She's in prison.

 NICOLE                    Oh.

 JOHN                    I don't tell most people.

 NICOLE                    I understand.

 JOHN                    She's innocent. She didn't kill the
                   woman.

 NICOLE                    ...Good.   I mean, I'm sure she didn't.

      Nicole doesn't know what else to say.

 JOHN                    We should really be getting home.

 NICOLE                        (feigns disappointment)
                   Oh, okay.

 JOHN                        (waving the envelope)
                   Thanks for the invitation.    We'll
                   try and make it.

 NICOLE                    That would be great.

      John heads back and scoops up Luke.       Nicole watches, trying
      not to look dumbfounded.

160 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- LATE AFTERNOON 160 
      John and Luke enter, John sorting through the mail.      Nothing            
      from Lara.

161 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 161 
      John finishes writing a letter on lined paper. He opens his
      drawer; it is full of letters in yellow envelopes. He pulls
      one out; it is from Lara, on lined paper. He stuffs his new
      letter in the old yellow envelope.

162 INT. LUKE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 162 
      This is the only room that is still furnished. John pokes
      his head in, sees Luke on his bed playing by himself.

 JOHN                    You want to read a letter from Mom?

      Luke shrugs as if he doesn't care, but then scoots over in
      his bed so that his dad can sit beside him. John does. He
      pulls the letter out of the envelope and reads.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                    Dearest Luke Who I Love, But Not As
                   Much As Chocolate...

 LUKE                    She didn't write that.

 JOHN                    My mistake. Dearest Luke, who I
                   love so, so much. I wish I could
                   have walked you home today, it was
                   so beautiful out.
 58. 


163 EXT. PAULA'S HOUSE - BACKYARD -- LATE AFTERNOON 163 
       Luke and John water Paula's vegetable garden.

 LUKE                   But what's wrong with her?

 JOHN                   She's not feeling well.

 LUKE                   Why didn't she just stay home?

 JOHN                   Because sometimes people get so sick
                  you have to go to the hospital to
                  get fixed.

 LUKE                   How do you know when you're that
                  sick?

 JOHN                   The doctors do tests.

       Something tweaks. John turns and looks back across the alley,
       at his open garage...and remembers their conversation. He
       drops the hose and takes Luke's hand.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                   Come on.

       They drop the hose in the garden and walk back to the house.

163A INT. JOHN AND LARA'S BATHROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON 163A 
       John flings open the medicine cabinet, finds an old bottle
       of Lara's insulin. He checks the label.                                   

163B INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 163B 
       John hits a key and a medical article appears: LIFE
 THREATENING COMPLICATIONS OF DIABETES. 
       ...Severe Hyperkalemia...extremely high levels of potassium
       ...cardiac arrest...particularly dangerous as there are no
       outward symptoms...

164 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - LATER -- NIGHT 164 
       The camera swirls as John searches the wall and photos of
       delivery vans arriving at the jail. Not seeing what he wants,
       he charges the desk & rifles through more photos.

 (CONTINUED) WHITE 9-10-09 59. 
164 CONTINUED: 164 
      He finally snatches the photo he's looking for. He turns it
      over -- on it is written TUESDAY 9:30 AM. And right over
      the phrase FIND THE KEY he pins the photo of a delivery van
      from a medical laboratory.

165 EXT. COUNTY JAIL -- MORNING 165 
      Parked at a distance, John watches from inside his Prius.
      Finally, a DRIVER steps out of the jail carrying a tray of
      test results. He opens the back door of the van.

166 EXT. STREETS -- DAY 166 
      John follows the van.

167 EXT. NURSING HOME -- DAY 167 
      John watches as the driver steps out with a tray, point and
      push his key fob, lock the doors and enter the nursing home.              

      IN THE PRIUS - MOMENTS LATER - John watches his stopwatch.
      The driver returns with a tray. John hits the stop button.
 1 MINUTE 48 SECONDS. 
168 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 168 
      John Googles: "How to break into a car."

169 INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT 169 
      John heats a screwdriver on the open flame of the gas fire,
      then places the red hot tip of it on an old tennis ball.

170 EXT. P.M.H. LAB -- MORNING 170 
      John waits, eating a donut. He sees the driver step out of                
      Pittsburgh Med Health Lab and walk to his panel van.                      

171 EXT. STREETS -- DAY 171 
      John follows the van again.

172 EXT. MEDICAL FACILITY -- DAY 172 
      Wearing his iPod, the driver steps out with a tray and presses
      his key fob; the van chirps and locks. He enters the building
      as John steps up to the driver's door.

      John checks no one is watching, places the tennis ball over
      the key slot and punches the ball flat. The lock pops open.

173 INT. LABORATORY VAN -- CONTINUOUS 173 
      Shelves line the walls; on them sit plastic trays of envelopes.
      John climbs in and finds the tray from ALLEGHENY COUNTY JAIL.

174 EXT. MEDICAL FACILITY -- CONTINUOUS 174 
      The driver comes back out, heading for the van. He pauses
      to flirt with a nurse on her break, but she isn't buying.

175 INT. VAN -- CONTINUOUS 175 
      John finds the envelope marked "Lara Brennan." He checks
      his watch, only 44 seconds have lapsed. He slips the card
      out, photographs it with his cell phone and puts it back.

176 EXT. MEDICAL FACILITY -- DAY 176 
      The driver heads for the van as John opens the back door and
      climbs out. Oblivious to his narrow escape, John closes the
      door and walks away a heartbeat before the driver gets there.

177 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- EVENING 177 
      John checks his son, who sits on the bare living room floor
      playing a video game on the TV, the remaining item.

 JOHN                  You okay?

      Luke nods and shoots somebody.

178 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- EVENING 178 
      John brings up Lara's form in Photoshop on his laptop and
      erases the hand-written numbers in the test results boxes.

179 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 179 
      John writes numbers in the blank boxes of the medical form.
      Then he sits back and worries that he's got it right. Calls:

 JOHN                  Luke!   Time for bed.

180 INT. LUKE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 180 
      John enters the child's bedroom and stops dead.

      The wall over Luke's bed is covered with crayon scribbles,
      imitating the chart on his father's bedroom walls.



 (CONTINUED) 61. 
180 CONTINUED: 180 
      Luke walks into the room, and steps up beside his father,
      staring at the wall. He takes his father's hand, and the
      two just stand there in silence.

181 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTACT VISITING ROOM -- DAY 181 
      John waits as the other prisoners enter. Lara kisses him;                         
      looks in his eyes. He sees the despair behind the smile.                          

 JOHN                    ...What's wrong?

      She takes a letter from her pocket.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                    What is it?

      She hands it to him.       John reads.   His face changes.                        

 JOHN (CONT'D)                    No....NO! They can't move you. Not
                   without notice! Monday isn't notice!                                 

 LARA                    I was only here through the appeal.                                  
                   We knew I'd be moved to a prison.                                    

 JOHN                    Muncy is the other side of the state.                                

      Lara nods. Off John's face, the screen goes BLACK.           Read:                

 THE LAST THREE DAYS 
182 INT. REALTOR'S OFFICE -- DAY 182 
      John stands with Eugenie, the frightened realtor.

 JOHN                    I don't have two weeks!     I need it                                
                   tomorrow!                                                            

 EUGENIE                    The title hasn't been cleared --
                   there is no way that --

 JOHN                    How much can they give me?!

 EUGENIE                    Nothing!

      John turns on his heel and slams out through the door.

183 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- DAY 183 
      John stares at the wall -- MONEY is down to $1,497.

      He rifles through a drawer, finds a pair of sunglasses.

      He snatches a baseball cap from a top shelf.

      He tosses a bag on the bed, unzips it and pulls out the gun.              

184 EXT. AIRPORT LONG TERM PARKING LOT -- DAY 184 
      John unscrews the license plate from a dusty black Prius.
      He sticks the plate under his jacket, stands and checks over
      his shoulder as he walks out of the massive parking lot.

185 INT. BANK AND MALL PARKING LOT -- DAY 185 
      A quiet neighborhood bank sits in the corner of an outdoor
      mall. The Prius pulls into a spot; we dolly over to see the
      stolen license plate.

      Inside the Prius, John opens the backpack, puts on the hat
      and sunglasses and places the gun on his lap. And again he
      looks at the bank, tapping his toe manically. A guard opens
      the bank door for a departing customer, smiles and heads
      back inside. John tightens his grip on the gun, tries to
      work up his courage, but ultimately realizes he can't do
      this.

      Furious with himself, he jams the car into reverse and backs
      up without looking. He hears a scream, brakes hard and looks.

      A WOMAN screams. John stomps on the brakes. He leaps out
      of the car and sees a woman dropping her groceries and
      scooping her child up in her arms. Call her ELAINE.

 ELAINE                  What are you doing?!   You almost
                 killed us!

 JOHN                  Are you --?

 ELAINE                  Are you out of your mind?!   You don't
                 look?!

      She stoops to grab the few items that fell.    He tries to
      help.

 JOHN                  I am so sorry --

 (CONTINUED) 63. 
185 CONTINUED: 185 
 ELAINE                    Get away!     Get away from us!

      She stands and runs for her car. John returns to the car
      and sits, leaving the door open and the door alarm screaming.
      He sits there, letting the failure and his disgust for his
      weakness wash over him.

186 INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- AFTERNOON 186 
      John sits in the children's area, waiting for the line of
      visitors to get shorter. One look at his face and we can
      see how tortured he is. He has his cell phone to his ear:

 MEYER (O.S.)                    I'm sorry.

 JOHN                    No, it was a long shot.       Thanks.

187 INT. CRIMINAL COURTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 187 
 MEYER                        (into phone)
                   How's Lara?

188 INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- CONTINUOUS 188 
 JOHN                    She's okay.     Thanks, Meyer.

      John hangs up and stands.

189 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTACT VISITING ROOM -- AFTERNOON 189 
      John stands in the corner, staring out through the high,
      thick windows. He turns as he hears Lara and other prisoners
      coming. He tries to smile, but she knows something is wrong.

 LARA                    What's wrong?

 JOHN                    Nothing.

 LARA                    Is it Luke?

 JOHN                    No. He's fine. I had Meyer see
                   what he could do about not getting
                   you moved.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                    I told him traveling that distance
                   would be a hardship on us, that Luke
                   was already having trouble at school.
                   Which is true. I haven't been
                   spending enough time with him.

 LARA                    You haven't? YOU haven't? God,
                   John, you are too much. Luke is
                   having a 'hard time' because mommy
                   is in jail for murder, not because
                   daddy doesn't spend enough time with
                   him! Your father was right, you
                   don't live in the same world we do.

 JOHN                        (stung)
                   That's nice, that the two of you
                   talk. What world do I live in, Lara?

 LARA                    I don't know, but it's not the real
                   one. I am in here for the rest of
                   my life! And you want me to believe
                   in some fantasy that -- !

      A guard steps up and raps her knuckles on the table to get
      their attention. Only John looks up.

 FEMALE GUARD                    We good here?

 JOHN                    Yes.   Sorry.

      Lara lowers her voice a little, but not her intensity.    The
      guard walks away under:

 LARA                    Now you come here all long-faced,
                   like you've let me down. What do
                   you want me to do, make you feel
                   better?

 JOHN                    Got it.   I'm sorry.

 LARA                    And now you're apologizing.   You
                   really are a gem.



 (CONTINUED) 65. 
189 CONTINUED: (2) 189 
 JOHN                    What do you want from me?

 LARA                    Nothing. You're too perfect already.
                   You know you never even asked me if
                   I did it. If I killed her.

 JOHN                        (stopped dead)
                   Because I knew you didn't.

 LARA                    Then you'd be wrong.

      She leans forward and whispers in his ear.

 LARA (CONT'D)                    I grabbed the fire extinguisher. I
                   hit her in the face. I heard her
                   neck snap. You know why I did it?
                   Because she pissed me off. I threw
                   her purse in the river. We paid for
                   dinner with the cash from her wallet.

      She sits back a bit to look in his face. Only now, looking
      in his eyes, a crack forms in her tough exterior.

 LARA (CONT'D)                    I'm sorry.   I'm actually very sorry.

      She stands. The guard opens the door and lets her into the
      changing room. John watches, unable to breathe.

190 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CHANGING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 190 
      Lara gets one last look at John, through the glass, and then
      disappears behind the partition. She sits on the bench,
      leans her head between her knees, and breaks into shards.

191 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS 191 
      John exits along with all the other visitors, destroyed by
      what he has heard, playing out what she said in his head.
      Then suddenly he just stops. The crowd keeps moving, leaving
      him behind. The guard following the group sees him standing
      there. Commands him:

 GUARD #2                    Sir, you cannot stand there.
                        (beat)
                   SIR, you need to exit the building
 NOW. 66. 


192 INT. COUNTY JAIL - VISITING BOOTHS -- MOMENTS LATER 192 
      Lara takes a seat on her side of the glass partition.    She
      picks up her phone and opens her mouth to speak.

 JOHN                  Shut up. I don't care what you say
                 or how you say it. I don't believe
                 you did it and I never will. I know
                 who you are.

      She opens her mouth to object but John slams the phone into
      the cradle. She pounds on the window. He just stares at
      her. Her eyes well up, and she smiles through her tears.

193 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR -- MOMENTS LATER 193 
      John steps out and sees the MAJOR waiting with his keys.
      They exchange a look.

 JOHN                  Thank you.

      The Major nods and locks the door.    John heads out.

194 INT. TOY SHOP -- DAY 194 
      Luke in his arms, John takes a My Little Pony off the shelf.                

 JOHN                  You think?

 LUKE                      (already an expert)
                 Girls love them.

195 INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- DAY 195 
      Grace opens the door. George stands a few steps behind her,
      quiet. Grace sees John and is immediately concerned.

 JOHN                  Hi Mom.

 GRACE                  What are you doing here?

 JOHN                  I've got class.

 GRACE                  Five o'clock at night?


 (CONTINUED) 67. 
195 CONTINUED: 195 
 JOHN                    Yes.
                          (kisses Luke)
                   Bye.

      Luke runs in as John walks off.

196 EXT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 196 
      John's father watches through the window as his son leaves.
      In his gut, George knows something is wrong.

197 EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT 197 
      John sits in his car down the street, watching the corner
      where he noticed kids selling drugs.

      A car shows up - the same flashy car he saw weeks ago. The
      street dealer looks around, runs to the window, makes an
      exchange, and then the car drives off again. John checks
      his watch and settles in to wait.

198 EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT 198 
      John watches as other cars drive up and score drugs. And
      then finally the flashy car cruises up again. John checks
      his watch: it has been two hours. Again the street dealer
      runs up and hands the driver an envelope. We recognize the
      driver -- he is the one from earlier, whom we are going to
      call DAVID. He drives away. John follows.

199 EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT 199 
      John follows the flashy car at a distance.    It stops at
      another corner and something is exchanged.    It drives on;
      John follows.

200 EXT. HILL DISTRICT - NEIGHBORHOOD -- NIGHT 200 
      Not the best part of town. It looks rough even for The Hill.
      The flashy car parks and David crosses the street.

      Half a block back, John turns left at the corner and then
      makes a quick right into the alley. He guesses how many
      houses from the corner David stopped, gets out and checks
      over the fences.

      He stops a few houses away when he sees the porch light on a
      house flick on. David waits on the dilapidated back porch.
      He waves to whoever is watching him through the pinhole and
      the light goes out again.



 (CONTINUED) WHITE 9-10-09 68. 
200 CONTINUED: 200 
      John inches closer as the back door opens. David exchanges
      a few words with whoever opened it and then packages are
      exchanged. The door closes and David walks off the way he
      came.

      John waits a moment, then moves down the alley, hops the
      fence, and sneaks through the twisted bramble of the back
      yard. He finds a place to hide, on the ground right beside
      the back porch. He pulls out his gun and settles in to wait
      between the trash cans, his heart pounding in his ears.

      Fade to BLACK.      Beat, then:   BANG!   BANG!    BANG!

201 EXT. DRUG DEALER'S BACK YARD -- LATER THAT NIGHT 201 
      John WAKES to HAMMERING on the door. The porch light flicks
      on and John is bathed in bright light -- he didn't realize
      he'd fallen asleep. David stands above him on the porch,
      holding the screen door open -- if he glanced down there is
      no way he wouldn't see him.

      John holds his     breath and waits. The porch light flicks
      off, the locks     are unbolted, and finally the thick door opens.
      As before, the     two exchange words, but now the POUNDING in
      John's ears is     so loud we can barely hear anything else.

      John takes a deep breath and springs to his feet -- knocking
      over the trash cans -- and onto the porch!

      He smacks David with the gun, grabs him by the hair and jams
      him forward into the doorway, preventing the supplier --
      ALEX -- from slamming the door on them.

202 INT. ALEX'S HOUSE -- NIGHT 202 
      Alex releases his BARKING German shepherd and it immediately
      attacks David, biting his leg. David screams in agony.

 JOHN                        (to Alex)
                   Back up! Get back!

      Suddenly a THUG comes barreling in from the kitchen and aims
      a sawed-off shotgun at John, who keeps himself right behind
      David's head. The dialogue is almost drowned out completely
      by the sound of POUNDING in John's ears and David's SCREAMING.

 ALEX                    -- Shoot them both!

 JOHN                    -- I'll shoot the dog!


 (CONTINUED) 69. 
202 CONTINUED: 202 
 ALEX                    -- Shoot the dog!

 THUG                    -- You shoot the dog, I'll kill you!

      John fires into the floor beside the dog.

 ALEX                    -- You want the police here, asshole?!

 JOHN                    -- Good idea!

      John fires two more shots into the floor.

 ALEX                        (to thug)
                   -- Put the gun down!

      The thug obeys, rests it against the wall.

 JOHN                    -- Call the dog off!!   Put it away!

 ALEX                    -- Release!

      The dog stops its attack but goes back to barking.

 JOHN                    -- Put it away!!
                       (aims gun at it)
 PUT IT AWAY!! 
      Alex reluctantly opens a closet door.

 ALEX                    In!   Get in!

      He has to shove the barking dog into the closet.

 JOHN                        (to thug)
                   You, too!

 THUG                    I'm not getting in there!

      John fires into the wall!

 ALEX                    Get in!

 (CONTINUED) 70. 
202 CONTINUED: (2) 202 
      And the thug goes in the closet after the barking dog.            John
      sees the bolt and drives it home, locking the door.

 JOHN                    -- Give me that chair!

      Alex doesn't obey, so David grabs it and hands it to him.
      John props it under the handle of the closet door.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                    Move!

      He shoves David forward, closer to Alex.

 ALEX                    You're dead.

 DAVID                    I didn't do anything!!

 ALEX                    You brought him!

 DAVID                    I didn't bring him!

 JOHN                    Shut up!

      He pushes them both back into the next room; the dog in the
      closet never stops barking.

203 INT. ALEX'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT 203 
      John shoves David to the floor and waves the gun between
      them.

 JOHN                    On your knees! Hands behind your
                   head!

      John catches Alex's eyes darting to the counter. Following
      his gaze he finds Alex's revolver on the counter. John grabs
      it, flips open the cylinder and spills out the cartridges.

 DAVID                    I can't kneel!

 JOHN                    On the floor!

      David kneels with great difficulty.         Alex calmly does as
      he's told, his eyes on John.

 (CONTINUED) 71. 
203 CONTINUED: 203 
      John grabs the paper bag out of Alex's hand and opens it,
      finds a couple thousand in cash.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                    Where's the rest?

 DAVID                    That's twelve hundred dollars!
                       (emptying his pockets)
                   Here, take it.

      A couple of hundred dollars spill onto the floor.

 JOHN                        (gun on Alex)
                   Where do you keep your money?!

      Alex scoffs, seeing weakness in John.

 ALEX                    Yeah, I'm going to give you my money.

 JOHN                    I'll shoot you!

 ALEX                    You won't even shoot a dog.

 JOHN                    Tell me!

 ALEX                    Shoot the floor again, impress me.

      John pistol-whips him and Alex goes down. John holds his
      gun to his head while he is on the ground bleeding.

 JOHN                    I'm going to kill you both.

 ALEX                    No, I'm going to kill you both.

 DAVID                    Give him your money!

 ALEX                        (to David)
                   Keep your dead bitch mouth shut.

      Enraged, John fires a round into Alex's leg.      Alex screams.



 (CONTINUED) 72. 
203 CONTINUED: (2) 203 
 DAVID                    Stop it!!

 ALEX                        (smiles thru pain)
                   See? You aren't going to kill me.
                   That was the worst you can do. So,
                   now you've done it. Go home. I'll
                   come find you and kill you.

      John looks around desperately. He spots an open bottle of
      tequila in the clutter on the counter. He grabs it and pours
      it on the floor.

 ALEX (CONT'D)                    You're wasting some good shit.

      Now he pours it on Alex.

 JOHN                    Yeah, good shit; high alcohol content.

      John smashes the bottle on the floor; tequila goes everywhere.

 THUG (O.S.)                    What's going on?! Let me out!

 ALEX                    You going to burn me out?

      John lights a rag as the thug in the closet continues to
      yell and pound. Now calmly:

 JOHN                    Yeah.    That's what I'm going to do.

 DAVID                    Oh Jesus.    Oh Jesus.

 JOHN                    Your money.

 ALEX                        (no longer smiling)
                   This is a meth lab, you idiot!

 JOHN                    No.    It was.

      And he tosses the burning rag at the smashed bottle.        David
      screams as the room explodes in flames.



 (CONTINUED) 73. 
203 CONTINUED: (3) 203 
 ALEX                        (suddenly desperate)
                   My kid is upstairs!!

 JOHN                    -- What??

 ALEX MY KID!! 
      Without warning, Alex dashes for the front hall. Stunned,
      John doesn't shoot. He grabs David by the hair, sticks the
      gun in his temple and shoves him into the front hall.

 DAVID                    Let me go!!

 JOHN                    Get up there!!

      John pushes him up the stairs as a shield, following the
      trail of blood.

 DAVID                    The house is going to explode!

 ANGLE ON BACK DOOR 
      Fire spreads, the thug yells, the dog barks. The shotgun
      leans against the wall where the thug left it. The closet
      door rocks as the thug kicks. The chair won't give way.

204 INT. ALEX'S HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR -- NIGHT 204 
      John moves David quickly up the stairs in front of him and
      down the hall. They peer into one room, nothing. Into the
      next - what is clearly a CHILD'S ROOM.

      Alex kneels on the far side of the room, barely visible behind
      the small bed, his back to us.

      Until he wheels, gun in hand, and FIRES twice.

      A bullet strikes David in the chest, the second grazes John's
      side. Both men are knocked back into the hall and onto the
      floor. John pulls himself out from under David as...

      Running on adrenaline, Alex stands and strides forward.
      David looks up at him. Alex shoots him again and steps over
      him into the hall. He sees John, raises his weapon and....

      John fires twice, hits Alex in the chest, knocking him down.


 (CONTINUED) 74. 
204 CONTINUED: 204 
      John stands. Alex lies dead, sprawled over David.   David
      looks around through the roiling smoke:

 JOHN                    Is anyone up here?!

      He steps over Alex and into the room. He checks the closet --
      empty of clothes; clearly no child lives here. John turns
      to where Alex was kneeling, sees a bureau pushed aside, a
      safe crudely installed in the wall lying open, a trash bag
      on the floor half-filled with cash.

      John drops to his knees and shovels the remaining cash into
      the trash bag.

205 INT. ALEX'S HOUSE - BACK HALL -- CONTINUOUS 205 
      The dog barks; the door SPLINTERS.

206 INT. ALEX'S HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR -- CONTINUOUS 206 
      John steps over the bodies; sees David looking up at him.

 DAVID                    Don't leave me. I don't want to
                   burn. Don't let me burn.

      The hall is now thick with smoke. John stares terrified at
      the two men, one dead, one dying, and agonizes over what he
      knows is a mistake. Cut to BLACK.

207 INT. ALEX'S HOUSE - BACK HALL -- MOMENTS LATER 207 
      John carries David past the closet just as the thug's boot
      kicks a hole in the door. Cut to BLACK.

208 EXT. ALLEY BEHIND ALEX'S HOUSE -- NIGHT 208 
      John, bleeding himself, shoves the badly wounded dealer into
      the back seat. He throws the trash bag into the passenger
      seat and slams the door closed behind him. Not even a
      heartbeat later THE GERMAN SHEPHERD leaps up and snaps at
      the partially open window. John struggles to get the car
      turned on and the window up as THE DOG tries to force his
      way into the car.

      Through the front windshield he sees THE THUG leap over the
      back fence, landing sprawled in the alley with the shotgun.

      John jams the car into reverse and backs away -- the man in
      the back seat screaming for his life, the dog chasing the
      car, the thug getting off a shot.
 75. 


209 EXT. STREET -- CONTINUOUS 209 
      John swerves wide around the corner, hitting a fire hydrant
      and shattering a taillight.

210 INT. PRIUS - DRIVING -- CONTINUOUS 210 
      John slams the transmission into Drive and speeds off down
      the street.

      The dog barking disappears. All that's left are the sounds
      of the dying man. John keeps throwing looks over his
      shoulder.

 DAVID                  I don't want to die.   I don't want
                 to die.

      Now at a safe distance, John pulls over and looks into the
      back seat. We don't have to see the body to know he's dead.

      John sits there a moment, listening to the sounds of
      approaching fire engines. He catches a glimpse of himself
      in the rearview mirror before pulling out. Cut to BLACK.                  

211 EXT. BUS STOP -- NIGHT 211 
      John's car idles at the curb, his back door sits open. He
      steps back into shot from the far side of the Prius, closes
      the door and gets in. As he drives away we see David's body
      lying on the bench, waiting to be discovered.

212 INT. FAST FOOD JOINT - TOILET -- NIGHT 212 
      Standing at the sink shirtless, John pours alcohol on the
      wound in his side.

      He mops up the blood with a wad of paper towels, then applies
      a bandage, fresh from the box. He pulls a new shirt and
      jacket from a Target bag.

      A moment later, now dressed, John stuffs the trash bag full
      of cash into his backpack.

213 INT. FAST FOOD JOINT -- NIGHT 213 
      John steps out of the bathroom, zipping his new jacket. He
      barely draws a look from the few customers as he limps out
      of the restaurant. Cut to BLACK.

214 EXT. ALEX'S HOUSE -- NIGHT 214 
      Water streams from the house, the front door and windows
      broken by firemen who now pack up their gear to leave.
      LIEUTENANT NABULSI strides into shot, drinking a Red Bull,
      which he crushes and discards on the porch.

215 INT. ALEX'S HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR -- CONTINUOUS 215 
      Nabulsi climbs the stairs to find SGT. HARRIS watching the
      CSI team work. Nabulsi steps up behind the CSI worker.                    

 LT. NABULSI                      (almost a whisper)
                 Get out of my way.

      The man flees like he just saw the prince of darkness.
      Nabulsi cocks his head and looks down at the dead man.

 LT. NABULSI (CONT'D)                  What do we have?

 SGT. HARRIS                  A miracle. Meth lab in the basement,
                 the house still standing. Should be
                 just a crater.

 LT. NABULSI                      (straddles Alex)
                 Do we know him?

 SGT. HARRIS                  Alex Gaidar, history of violence and
                 drug trafficking.

      Nabulsi sees the brightly painted walls of the child's room.

 LT. NABULSI                  He have a kid?

 SGT. HARRIS                  Neighbor said wife left with him
                 last year. Big surprise there.

 LT. NABULSI                  They type all this blood yet?

 SGT. HARRIS                  No, but someone left through the back
                 door bleeding. Zone Three found a
                 gunshot victim dead on a transit bench.

      Nabulsi nods and descends the stairs.

216 EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET -- NIGHT 216 
      John snips the links of a tall chainlink fence, then turns
      and walks back to the Prius.

217 INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT 217 
      John eases open his parents' front door and removes his key
      from the lock. It's the middle of the night, so he is
      surprised to see a light on in the kitchen. He enters,
      carrying his jacket and backpack, and places them on a chair.
      When he gets to the kitchen he sees his father in his pajamas,
      reading a biography and sipping a cup of tea.

 JOHN                  Hi.    What are you doing up?

      George shrugs.     An uncomfortable silence.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                  I've come to get Luke.

      George nods. After another silence, John starts down the
      hall. His father appears in the hallway behind him.

 GEORGE                  John?    Are you alright?

      John turns around, surprised.

 JOHN                  I'm fine.

      The two men look at each other for a moment, John leaves the
      room.

      His father steps into the living room and notices his jacket
      falling off the chair. George lifts it to set it right and
      sees something is sticking out of the backpack: airplane
      tickets and passports.

218 INT. JOHN'S OLD ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 218 
      John steps into the room that he had as a teenager. Luke
      sleeps in the single bed. John sits beside him, touches his
      face, then looks around the room, wondering how he got here,
      and is overwhelmed.

219 INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 219 
      George slips the tickets and passports out of the side pocket.
      We do not see the destination, but he does. He opens the
      passport and reads each of the false names.
 78. 


220 INT. JOHN'S OLD ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 220 
      John brushes away tears, no idea how he could be acting like
      this. He tries to wake Luke.

 JOHN                  Hey.   Hey, buddy.

      Not a chance. John checks the old alarm clock: it's just
      after three AM. He lies down beside Luke for just a moment.

221 INT. JOHN'S OLD ROOM -- NIGHT 221 
      John WAKES to the sound of a whistle. He checks the clock.
      It's almost five. How could that have happened?

222 INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT 222 
      John helps a sleepy Luke with his jacket, pancake rolled in
      his hand. John stands from the table strewn with food.

 JOHN                  What do you say?

 LUKE                  Thank you.

 JOHN                  Give Grandma a big kiss.

 LUKE                  I'm too tired to kiss.

 JOHN                  Luke...

 GRACE                  I'll get lots of kisses next weekend.
                     (to John)
                 We want to take him to the Harvest
                 Festival in Kutztown, where they
                 have the Clydesdales.

      John thinks about saying something, can't.   He watches Luke
      give Grace a kiss.

 LUKE                  Thank you, Grandma.

      John turns to his father, who stands in the doorway.

      His father holds out the jacket in silence. John takes it.
      The airline tickets stick out from the inside pocket.

 (CONTINUED) 79. 
222 CONTINUED: 222 
      John realizes the tickets have been moved from the bag. He
      looks at his father, who gazes back at him in silence. John
      can tell by the look in his father's eye that he knows.

 JOHN                    Bye Mom.

      They kiss.    John's father stands behind him.

 GEORGE                    Goodbye.

      George grabs his son in an awkward hug.      John is shocked.
      He pats his father's back. They break.

 JOHN                        (to Luke)
                   Let's go.

      John leaves.      The front door closes.   Grace walks away.

223 EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET -- PRE-DAWN 223 
      John stands in the brightly lit, glass-walled kiosk of a
      rental car company, the Prius parked at the curb, as the sun
      threatens to break over the horizon.

224 EXT. STREET NEAR ALEX'S HOUSE -- PRE-DAWN 224 
      Nabulsi kneels beside a fire hydrant, using a shard from a
      taillight to scrape at a smudge of flaking black paint.
      Harris comes running up, out of breath, from the alley.

 SGT. HARRIS                    Neighbors saw a guy and a dog chase
                   a black car down the alley, so that's
                   probably his. We'll have the
                   taillight debris at the lab by the
                   time it opens.

 LT. NABULSI                    Before.                                                         

      Nabulsi stands and hands him the large shard of glass.                       

225 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- MORNING 225 
      John packs a backpack -- two white lab coats, wire cutters,
      a large screwdriver, two rolls of duct tape, the handgun,
      insulin vials, etc.
 80. 


226 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- MORNING 226 
      Luke sits on his bedroom floor, trying to cram a firetruck                
      into his already full rollerboard.                                        

 LUKE                      (calls)
                 Can I carry it?

      John appears with a box of trash bags.

 JOHN                  No.    Just what fits in your bag.                             

      John hurries off.

 LUKE                  ....What about my pockets?

 JOHN (O.S.)                  Or your pockets.

      Luke gives up on the truck and moves to his bedside table.
      He digs his hand into the small jar of coins his dad gave
      him and starts stuffing them in his pants pocket.

      A quarter falls and rolls to the middle of the floor.

227 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- MORNING 227 
      John takes a thick felt marker and writes two numbers on his              
      wrist, right beside the watch. 15, and under it, 35.                      

      He then turns and stares at his wall, all the photos,
      sketches, notes, wondering if he's forgotten anything. He
      decides it is too late to worry. He loosens an edge of
      wallpaper and starts tearing it all down.

228 EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - GARAGE AND ALLEY -- MORNING 228 
      Luke sits in the back seat with their carry-on bags. John
      tries to stuff all the garbage bags full of paper into the
      back.

      He picks the last off the floor and turns and walks out to
      the alley. He looks around, then stuffs this final bag into
      his neighbor's trash can.

229 EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET -- MORNING 229 
      John tosses the last trash bags over the side of the dumpster             
      that sits in front of a demolished house. As he closes the
      tailgate we get a good look at the broken taillight.                      
 81. 


230 INT. PRIUS - DRIVING 230 
      He checks the clock on the dashboard and drives faster, taking
      a quick glance at his son to see if he is okay back there.

231 EXT. REAR OF P.M.H LAB -- MORNING 231 
      John sits in his car in the back alley, watching the parking
      lot. The driver comes out carrying trays of test results
      and puts them in the back of his van. John grabs the large                
      wire cutters and screwdriver from his car and hops out. He                
      takes a few steps to the rear of the one-story building,
      pries open the phone box and snips the phone wires.

232 INT. P.M.H. LAB -- AT THAT MOMENT 232 
      A clerk on the phone is cut off. She jabs the connection
      key, does not get a dial tone -- looks to the lights on the
      other phone lines and sees them go out as...

233 EXT. REAR OF P.M.H LAB -- AT THAT MOMENT 233 
      John snips the last wire and hops back into the car.     He is
      moving before the van exits the parking lot.

234 EXT. NURSING HOME -- MORNING 234 
      The van driver hops out and heads into the nursing home as
      the Prius pulls into the foreground. John turns to Luke.

 JOHN                  Daddy will just be a minute.

      John grabs his tennis ball.

235 INT. LABORATORY VAN -- MORNING 235 
      John holds his lab results between his teeth as he flips
      through the envelopes. He finally finds Lara's envelope,
      removes her report and replaces it with this one.

236 EXT. NURSING HOME -- MORNING 236 
      We watch through the windshield of the Prius as the lab van
      drives off in the direction of the prison.

      John tugs Carrie's birthday invitation from his pocket, flips
      it open, checks the handwritten address.

237 INT. POLICE STATION - HOMICIDE DIVISION -- MORNING 237 
      Harris enters Lt. Nabulsi's cubicle to find him standing.


 (CONTINUED) 82.

 SGT. HARRIS                    Taillight matches any 2004-2009 Prius.

 LT. NABULSI                        (with a certain disgust)
                   What kind of a criminal drives a
                   Prius?

 SGT. HARRIS                    A socially responsible one?
                       (avoids Nabulsi's searing
                        look by reading the report)
                   Over a thousand of them registered
                   in the city, seven thousand in the
                   state.

 LT. NABULSI                    How many registered to felons?

 SGT. HARRIS                    Six in the state. Four of them to
                   embezzlers or white collar criminals,
                   one to a rapist, one to a murderer.

 LT. NABULSI                    Guess we start with the murderer.

 SGT. HARRIS                    She's in prison for life.      The rapist
                   is out.

 LT. NABULSI                    Find him.

238 EXT. NICOLE'S HOUSE -- MORNING 238 
      John stands with Luke, who holds a hand-wrapped gift.        Luke            
      knocks at the front door of a lovely small house.                            

 NICOLE (O.S.)                    Hello?                                                          

      They see Nicole in the side yard, spreading a paper tablecloth.              

 JOHN                    ...Hi.                                                          

      They move to help keep the tablecloth from blowing away.                     

 NICOLE                    Thanks.   Good to see you.

                   It's a pony.                                               

 NICOLE                    Those aren't easy to wrap.                                 
                       (now awkward)
                   You know the party is at eleven,
                   right?

 JOHN                    What time is it?
                       (checks watch)
                   Nine. Oh, I'm so sorry, I should
                   have looked more carefully.

 NICOLE                    It's no problem.

                   Why don't you go give this to Carrie?                      

      Luke spots Carrie on the back step and runs over.                       

 NICOLE (CONT'D)                    Well, I guess you can help.                                

 JOHN                    Oh. Actually, I can't stay.   I have                       
                   to run some errands.

 NICOLE                        (recovering with grace)                                
                   We'll see you later then.

                       (a moment)
                   If....

      John looks to Luke and realizes this might be the last time             
      he sees him.                                                            

 JOHN (CONT'D)                    He...He has my parents' phone number
                   in his pocket. In case I'm late.

 NICOLE                    No problem.

      who load Lara into an ambulance. JAIL GUARD #1 steps into                 
      the back of the ambulance with her. The ambulance pulls
      out, accompanied by a County Sheriff's car. John follows.

248 INT. AMBULANCE - MOVING -- DAY 248 
      Handcuffed and shackled, Lara stares lifelessly at her GUARD              
      as the EMT connects the leads of a heart monitor.                         

249 EXT. CITY STREETS -- DAY 249 
      Knowing where they are going now, John passes the ambulance
      and escort vehicle.

250 EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- MORNING 250 
      Nabulsi peers in the window.    Harris comes up the side from
      the back.

 SGT. HARRIS                  No car in the garage. You want to
                 get a warrant?

 LT. NABULSI                  Yeah.

      Nabulsi reluctantly slips a credit card into the door jam.
      Harris looks around to check no one is watching.

251 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 251 
      The front door pops open and Nabulsi and Harris step in.
      They quickly see that all the furniture is gone.

252 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- DAY 252 
      Nabulsi joins Harris, who is staring at the wall where the
      wallpaper has been removed.

 LT. NABULSI                  Get the warrant.

253 EXT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ENTRANCE -- DAY 253 
      The sheriff's car and ambulance pull into the underground
      entrance. Guard #2 steps from the passenger seat of the
      ambulance and surveys the surroundings, shotgun in hand,
      before he knocks on the rear door of the ambulance. They
      follow procedure in taking the prisoner into the hospital.
      The sheriff watches until they are safe inside, then leaves.

254 INT. LUKE'S ROOM -- DAY 254 
      Nabulsi inspects Luke's room, still fully furnished, the
      curious faded crayon drawing on the wall. He spots a couple
      of coins on the floor. He picks up a quarter, and flips it.
      Harris steps into the room.

 SGT. HARRIS                  She's being transferred to University
                 Hospital.

 LT. NABULSI                  Right now?

 SGT. HARRIS                  Right now.

254 CONTINUED: 254 
 LT. NABULSI                    ...Have them call the escort vehicle.
                   Tell them we'll meet them at the
                   hospital in less than ten.

      And he pockets the quarter and steps out of the room.

255 INT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - SEVENTH FLOOR CORRIDOR -- DAY 255 
      The EMT and two JAIL GUARDS wheel Lara up to the desk and                 
      hand over her chart.                                                      

 JAIL GUARD #1                    We have Lara Brennan.

      The duty nurse checks her chart and nods to a NURSE.                      

 DUTY NURSE                    Put her in 7725 and start an IV.                             

      The EMT passes her over to the nurse and leaves. The DUTY                 
      NURSE picks up the phone as they move off down the hall.                  

 DUTY NURSE (CONT'D)                        (into phone)
                   Can you please page Dr. Becsey?

256 INT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - ROOM 7725 -- DAY 256 
      The nurse wheels her in and GUARD #2 uncuffs her from the                 
      gurney, as GUARD #1 gets a call on his cell phone.                        

 JAIL GUARD #1                    Yeah?... We're here: prisoner's
                   secure, no problems.... Will do.

      He hangs up and turns to see John enter, carrying Luke's                  
      backpack, wearing a white doctor's smock. He raises a gun.                

 JOHN                    Put the phone down.

      Guard #1 obeys.                                                           

 NURSE                    Oh please, no.                                               

 LARA                    John??

 JOHN                    Remove your holsters, put them on
                   the floor and get on your knees.

 LARA                        (can't make sense of this)
                   What are you doing here?

 JOHN DO IT!! 
      Guard #2 reaches for his weapon; John pistol whips him to                      
      the floor. The nurse cups a hand over her mouth to stifle a                    
      scream.                                                                        

 JOHN (CONT'D) DO IT NOW!! 
257 EXT. STREET -- DAY 257 
      Harris speeds toward the hospital.         Nabulsi is on the radio.

 DISPATCHER (V.O.)                    Lieutenant, the prisoner is secure;                               
                   jail personnel are 10-27, Code 4. A
                   squad car will meet you at the
                   entrance.

      Nabulsi puts the walkie down and flips on the siren.          Harris           
      reacts.

 SGT. HARRIS                    She just said --

 LT. NABULSI                    Run the light.

258 INT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - ROOM 7725 -- DAY 258 
      A second handgun and holster      slides across the floor to meet              
      the one that already lies by      John's feet. The two guards
      kneel, facing the far wall.       John pulls a roll of duct tape               
      from the backpack and tosses      it to the terrified nurse.                   

 JOHN                    Tape their hands and feet.
                       (when he hesitates)
                   Do it!!

      The nurse tapes the guards' wrists behind their backs.                         

 LARA                    You have to stop this.

 JAIL GUARD #1                    You walk out that door with him and
                   you will both be killed.

 (CONTINUED) 89.

 JOHN                    Tape their mouths!

      John picks up the key and undoes Lara's cuffs.

 LARA                    No.   Stop.

      John yanks her clothing and a white smock out of the bag and
      tosses them to her.

 JOHN                    Put it on.

 LARA WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?! 
 JOHN                    Because we have no other choice!!
                   Put it on!
                       (to nurse)                                                      
                   Turn around.

      He does, John starts taping his wrists.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                    Lara, put the clothes on!

 LARA                    No.

 JOHN NOW!! 
 LARA                    No!

      They stare at each other.         John offers her his cell phone.

 JOHN                    Okay. Tell your son you aren't
                   coming.

 LARA                    ...Where is he?

 JOHN                    Waiting for you. Tell him you aren't
                   coming.

 LARA                    How can you do this to me?


 (CONTINUED) 90.

 JOHN                     Push send. Tell him I'm not coming
                    back either.

 LARA                     John --

 JOHN                     Does it look like I'm going home?!
                    Tell him he is alone now and his
                    mother and father aren't coming back!

       Lara stares at him with hatred, mutters:

 LARA                     You son of a bitch.

       Lara pulls off her prison garb, standing before them naked
       except for her panties. She quite purposely does not turn
       away or cover herself, but lets her eyes burn into him.
       John presses the STOPWATCH button on his watch and the COUNTER
       starts running.

259 EXT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ENTRANCE -- DAY 259 
       A squad car pulls up outside the hospital's main entrance.
       One officer strides into the Emergency Room while the other
       takes a look around the parking lot.

260 INT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - SEVENTH FLOOR HALLWAY 260 
       Lara and John step out into the hall. John's eyes flick to               
       the Nurse's Desk but he keeps walking. As they pass we notice            
       DR. LIFSON standing there with Lara's file in her hand. The              
       Duty Nurse notices as well. It takes a second for Lifson to              
       understand what is going on. She steps out into the hall                 
       and stares after them.                                                   

 DR. LIFSON                     What are you doing?                                         

       John yanks Lara's arm and makes a dash for the elevator,                 
       pulling his gun from his pocket.                                         

       The Duty Nurse sees what is happening and bolts down the                 
       hall, throwing open the door to room 7725.                               

260A INT. HOSPITAL - 7TH FLOOR ELEVATOR LOBBY 260A 
       The elevator doors are closing as John arrives and jams his              
       arm in between them. The passengers see the weapon.

 JOHN                     Get out!    Get out!

       They scurry out and the doors close. A heartbeat later the               
       next elevator opens and the cop from downstairs steps off.               

261 INT. HOSPITAL ELEVATOR -- DAY 261 
 LARA                     Where's Luke?! Is he safe?   Where
                    is he?!

 JOHN                     He's safe!

262 EXT. EMERGENCY ENTRANCE -- DAY 262 
       The unmarked car brakes hard. Nabulsi and Harris stride out
       and into the ER, flipping their ID into their breast pockets.

263 INT. HOSPITAL ELEVATOR -- DAY 263 
       Lara and John barely breath.                                             

264 EXT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - HANDICAP PARKING AREA -- DAY 264 
       The uniformed officer who stayed outside finds John's black
       Prius with the broken taillight parked in a handicapped spot.
       He lifts his walkie and CALLS IT IN.

265 INT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - MAIN FLOOR -- DAY 265 
       Nabulsi jabs the elevator button. He reacts as a HOSPITAL
       SECURITY GUARD comes running toward him.

 LT. NABULSI                     What's wrong?

       Before he can answer, the elevator doors open and they come
       face to face with John and Lara. John sees their police IDs
       and levels his weapon.

       Around them, patients and employees scream and run away.

 JOHN                     Back away!

 LT. NABULSI                     Don't be stupid. Drop the weapon.                           

 JOHN                     Get back!

 JOHN                        (to Lara)
                   Hit the button.

      Lara stands frozen.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                    Hit it!

      She presses a button.     The doors start to close.

 LT. NABULSI                    Don't do this.                                               

      Doors closed.     Nabulsi runs and screams:

 LT. NABULSI (CONT'D)                    Where are the stairs?!

      HOSPITAL SECURITY GUARD #2 leads the way. Nabulsi and Harris
      pass him at the door as he yells into his walkie.

 HOSPITAL SECURITY GUARD #2                    Male and female; white lab coats!
                   Parking levels!

266 INT. HOSPITAL ELEVATOR -- CONTINUOUS 266

                   Look at me! Do what I say; it'll be
                   okay; I promise.

      She stares at him, having never seen him like this before.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                    Lara?

      She nods.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                    Take the coat off.
 93. 


267 INT. HOSPITAL STAIRWELL AND P1 LEVEL -- CONTINUOUS 267 
      Nabulsi, Harris and the guard bound down the stairs into the
      lower elevator lobby. Nabulsi sees the doors aren't opening
      and runs back to the stairs, meeting the cop from upstairs
      on his way down.

 LT. NABULSI                   Stay here!

 HOSPITAL SECURITY GUARD #2                       (into walkie)
                  Parking garage! Get your asses down
                  here!

      Nabulsi and Harris leave them and thunder down the stairs.

268 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY - P3 LEVEL -- CONTINUOUS 268 
      The elevator doors open and John tosses the lab coats out
      toward a trash can in the direction of the garage. He pounds
      the elevator button.

269 INT. P2 LEVEL 269 
      Nabulsi and Harris burst onto this floor -- see the elevator
      doors are closed.

 LT. NABULSI                   Watch that door!

      Harris obeys as Nabulsi flings himself down the next flight.

270 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY - P3 LEVEL -- CONTINUOUS 270 
      The elevator isn't closing. John slams the button repeatedly.
      He hears Nabulsi's heavy feet on the stairs, angles and aims
      the weapon -- Lara can't believe what she's witnessing.
      Suddenly the doors close, just a heartbeat before Nabulsi
      gets there. Nabulsi spots the discarded lab coats and runs
      out into THE GARAGE. He heads for the ramp, scanning the
      parked cars.

      Getting to the bottom of the ramp he looks up and sees a
      SQUAD CAR racing down toward him. As it brakes, Nabulsi
      realizes they couldn't have escaped this way; he's been had.              

 LT. NABULSI                       (shouts into walkie)
                  Who's in the lobby?!

      But he only gets static.    He charges back toward the stairs.            
 94. 


271 INT. ELEVATOR - LOBBY LEVEL -- CONTINUOUS 271 
      The doors open. John peers around the corner, hiding his
      weapon. No police in the lobby, but through the glass doors
      he sees a squad car screeching to a halt. He grabs Lara's
      hand and leads her out of the elevator and around the corner.

      They weave down a corridor, deeper into the hospital, passing
      another cop at the Emergency Desk who has his back to them.

      They turn the corner, see a hospital guard running toward
      them. John recognizes him as the guard he argued with when
      Lara attempted suicide. John stiffens, but the guard runs
      past -- looking for a couple in lab coats. They quicken
      their steps. The guard stops at the end of the hall and
      turns to stare, recognizing them. He lifts his walkie and
      speaks.

 HOSPITAL SECURITY GUARD #1                  Main floor, rear corridor.

      John and Lara turn a corner. John spots the SHIPPING OFFICE.             
      They enter and head for the loading bay.

272 INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS 272 
      Nabulsi and Harris break into the lobby, sweating. Officers
      run in the front doors toward him. Nabulsi surveys the scene,
      realizes they couldn't have gone out the front. He hears a
      shout:

 HOSPITAL SECURITY GUARD #1 (O.S.)                  Back here!

      They turn and run in the direction of the voice, turning the
      corner and seeing the SECURITY GUARD at the end of the hall,
      who sees them coming turns and runs off after John and Lara.

 LT. NABULSI                      (into radio, on the run)
                 Get units to Grant Street!

273 EXT. HOSPITAL LOADING DOCK -- CONTINUOUS 273 
      John punches open the door and they hop down off the dock
      and take off for the street.

274 EXT. REAR OF UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS 274 
      John tugs Lara across the street, dodging traffic. He yanks              
      off his jacket and pulls it back on inside-out -- this side              
      is black and gold.                                                       
 95. 


275 EXT. REAR OF UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS 275 
       Nabulsi runs out of the loading dock and into the middle of                  
       Grant Street, HARRIS and the two OFFICERS trailing. Very                     
       few pedestrians right here. Nabulsi looks to his right: a                    
       crowded crosswalk, fans heading through a pedestrian mall to                 
       a Penguins game. He looks to his left: more fans moving                      
       toward the stadium. Almost all of them are wearing team                      
       colors - a sea of black and gold. Nabulsi curses.                            

276 EXT. NEARBY PEDESTRIAN MALL -- DAY 276 
       Lara and John weave through the fans.                                        

 JOHN                    Put your hair down.                                              

       Lara obeys without thinking. John checks his watch, then
       opens a door. Leaving the throng of fans, he guides Lara                     
       through and down the stairs into the T-Train Subway Station.

277 EXT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS 277 
       Nabulsi runs to the crosswalk as Harris takes the other                      
       direction. The other two officers take the far sidewalks.                    

278 INT. T-TRAIN SUBWAY STATION -- CONTINUOUS 278 
       John and Lara quicken their pace.    The camera tilts up and                 
       to the glass ceiling.                                                        

278A EXT. PEDESTRIAN MALL -- CONTINUOUS 278A 
       Nabulsi searches the faces in the mall. He looks down through                
       the station skylight, catches a fleeting glimpse of them. He                 
       runs for the entrance, his walkie flying to his face.                        

 LT. NABULSI                    They're on the platform! Block

                   the Port Authority. Stop all trains!                             

279 INT. T-TRAIN SUBWAY STATION -- CONTINUOUS 279 
       John sees a train approaching as they come down the stairs.                  
       Almost dragging Lara, John nudges past slower people to make                 
       it onto the train. Then they wait. The doors don't close.                    

280 EXT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - MAIN ENTRANCE -- CONTINUOUS 280 
       Walkie in hand, Harris jumps into their unmarked car and                     
       pulls out. Two SQUAD CARS wail out past him.                                 
 WHITE 9-10-09 96. 


281 INT. T-TRAIN SUBWAY STATION -- CONTINUOUS 281 
      Above -- Nabulsi sees the train and shoves past commuters.                

282 INT. T-TRAIN -- CONTINUOUS 282 
      John spots him coming, slips the long screwdriver from the                
      small backpack he's carrying. Lara sees him tighten his                   
      fingers around the grip. The doors finally close just as:                 

283 INT. T-TRAIN SUBWAY STATION -- CONTINUOUS 283 
      Nabulsi bounds down the stairs. The train leaves the station.             
      Nabulsi leaps down onto the tracks and chases it.                         

284 EXT. T-TRAIN STATION -- DAY 284 
      This station sits above ground. Three squad cars scream up.
      The officers clamor out of the cars and run for the platform.             

285 EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET -- DAY 285 
      Harris skids the unmarked vehicle around the corner, heading
      parallel to the underground.

286 INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL -- DAY 286 
      Nabulsi runs down the tracks, the car ahead nowhere in sight.

287 INT. T-TRAIN -- CONTINUOUS 287 
      The T-Train DRIVER gets an emergency call from the base. He
      looks back into the car as IT RISES UP OUT OF THE UNDERGROUND.

      Daylight floods the car as the train emerges from underground.
      John jams the long screwdriver into the door and PRIES IT
 OPEN. 
288 EXT. T-TRAIN AND TRACKS -- DAY 288 
      The wheels SCREECH and the brakes SEIZE. Passengers topple
      to the floor. John grabs Lara and they leap out onto the
      tracks.

      He finds the slit he cut in the tall fence. They slip out
      through it, onto the street and into the parking lot beyond.

289 INT. HARRIS' UNMARKED CAR -- CONTINUOUS 289 
      Harris screams along the road on the far side of the tracks.
      He locks up his BRAKES as he sees the stalled T-Train.
 WHITE 9-10-09 97. 


290 EXT. PARKING LOT - OTHER SIDE OF THE TRACKS -- CONTINUOUS 290 
      John yanks off his jacket as they jump into the rented SUV.                 
      John calms his racing heart, drives away and turns the corner.              

291 EXT. T-TRAIN TRACKS -- CONTINUOUS 291 
      Harris leaps from his vehicle and runs to the fence on his
      side of the tracks -- it is ten feet tall with razor wire,
      no way over it. He sees:

      Nabulsi charge up out of the tunnel. He jumps into the
      stalled train car, looks around, doesn't see John and Lara.

292 EXT. TUNNEL UNDER RIVER -- MORNING 292 
      The SUV comes up out of the dark and drives away from the
      city center, as a police helicopter swoops overhead, going
      the opposite direction.

293 INT. RENTED SUV -- MORNING 293 
      John checks the counter, still running on his watch. 11:05.
      He wets his thumb and rubs his wrist until the 15 is erased.
      All that remains now is the second number: 35. They merge
      into traffic heading toward the suburbs.

294 EXT. T-TRAIN TRACKS -- MORNING 294 
      Nabulsi pushes through the hole in the wire. Harris runs
      across the tracks with his jacket off, having scaled the
      fence on the far side.

 LT. NABULSI                       (into walkie)

 JOHN                    You would've stopped me.

      He nods toward the glove box                                                 

 JOHN (CONT'D)                    There's a case in there. Brush,                                 
                   moisturizer, makeup. Everything you                             
                   had was old. I hope I got it right.

      She opens the glove box, unzips the case, and is touched by                  
      this small gesture.

296 INT. POLICE STATION - HOMICIDE DIVISION -- DAY 296 
      Detective Collero, who we last saw when they arrested Lara,
      stops by Detective Quinn's cubicle.

 DETECTIVE COLLERO                    You want to take a guess who just
                   escaped from jail?

297 EXT. NICOLE'S HOUSE -- MORNING 297 
      Lara sits in the SUV at the curb. John waits at the door.
      It is opened by BRENDA, Nicole's mother.                                     

 BRENDA                    Hello.

 JOHN                    Hi.   I'm here for my son.

 BRENDA                    Oh, they aren't back yet.                                       

 JOHN                    Back from where?

 BRENDA                    The zoo.

 JOHN                    ...The zoo?                                                     

      Finds an invite and hands it to him.       The back clearly says             
      they are going to the zoo.                                                   

 BRENDA                    It's a zoo party.

 JOHH                    No.    Thank you.                                                   

      John turns and walks back to the SUV.          Brenda watches for a              
      moment, made curious by his behavior.

      He gets into the vehicle.         Lara is in a panic.

 LARA                    What's wrong?

      John punches ZOO into POINTS OF INTEREST on the GPS.                             

 LARA (CONT'D)                    Where's Luke?

 JOHN                    He's at the party.

      He sneaks a look at his stopwatch: 24 MINUTES and counting.

 LARA                    What party?     You said the party was                              
                   here.

 JOHN                    I was wrong.     She took them to the                               
                   zoo.

      The GPS comes up with an address.          John punches a button.

 LARA                           (can't help herself)
                   She?

      He drops the transmission into gear and speeds off.

298 EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- MORNING 298 
      A squad car is waiting, another arrives.          Harris pulls up
      and strides toward the house.

 SGT. HARRIS                    Canvas the neighbors. We're looking

                   noticed in the last few days.

299 EXT. CITY STREETS -- MORNING 299 
      John drives like a man possessed.

300 INT. SUV - DRIVING THROUGH INTERSECTION -- MORNING 300 
      John brakes as he spots a State Trooper vehicle at an                    
      intersection. As he keeps an eye on the rearview mirror,                 
      the squad car puts on its flashers, turns and follows them.

      John's hands tighten on the wheel. He keeps the speedometer              
      at 35, praying he's not their target.

      The police vehicle passes them and takes off fast down the
      four lane street.

      John breathes again and drives on. He checks the stopwatch -
      29 minutes flicks to 30. He pushes the button on the GPS.

 GPS VOICE                    Time to destination: eleven minutes.

      Lara sees him sweat, unaware of the significance of the time.

301 EXT. STREETS -- DAY 301 
      The SUV swerves around a corner, heading into the outskirts
      of town.

302 INT. SUV - FOUR LANE STREET -- DAY 302 
      John's eyes flick to his stopwatch: 32 minutes flicks to 33.

      Signs appear quickly now.    Interstate: Keep Right; Zoo: Next
      Left.

      John keeps driving, hoping somehow that he won't have to
      make this choice -- their freedom, or their son.

      Too many questions rage across his face. Perhaps they can
      escape and his parents can somehow arrange to get Luke to
      them. Or perhaps Luke would be better off with his
      grandparents after all.

      Then there it is:

      The sign to the interstate points to the entrance ahead on
      the right.

                   there.

      No response. Lara looks back over her shoulder, wondering                
      if this is some kind of shortcut.

 LARA                    What??

 JOHN                    They'll take care of him, I will
                   figure out how to get him to us.

 LARA                    Are you out of your mind!

 JOHN                    I tried!! There's no more time!!
                   Any second now there's going to be a
                   roadblock ahead! It might be there
                   now!! If we don't get out now we
                   don't get out!!

      Lara sits back in her seat, stunned and horrified, as John
      continues.

                   way to get Luke to us. I will find
                   some way.

      Lara unsnaps her seat belt. She reaches for the door latch.
      John sees her pull the door and GRABS her by the shirt as he
      slams his foot on the brakes!

      The tires SCREAM, the SUV skids into an uncontrolled turn.

      Horns blare. Cars behind them swerve to avoid collision.
      John holds Lara in her seat as the SUV flies around in a
      circle and finally comes to a dead stop on the shoulder,
      miraculously facing in the right direction.

      John allows himself to breathe. He lets go of Lara's shirt.               
      She opens the door and steps out.                                         

      John closes his eyes and tries to gather himself back
      together. He opens his door and steps out.                                

305 EXT. INTERSTATE HWY - SHOULDER -- DAY 305 
      John sees the big rig truck driver look back from where he's              
      pulled over. John nods to him that everything is okay and                 
      comes around the bumper to find Lara sitting on the gravel
      shoulder, leaning against the back tire, staring out at the
      field beyond. He sits beside her in silence.

      Behind them the cars whip by.    No one even thinks to stop to
      see if they need help.

      Lara and John watch a cow in the farmer's field.

      There is nothing for either of them to say, they both know
      how they got here.

      Their hands sit on the gravel between each other. Without
      looking at him, Lara tentatively entwines a single finger
      with his. He slowly gathers strength from her touch.                      

306 INT. SUV - ON THE SHOULDER -- MOMENTS LATER 306 
      They close the doors, and John starts the engine and they

307 EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - ALLEY -- DAY 307 
      A garbage truck is just pulling up as Paula shows Harris and

308 EXT. ZOO ENTRANCE -- DAY 308 
      Lara sits in the SUV by herself, watching the entrance.

309 EXT. ZOO -- DAY 309 
      Nicole, surrounded by a dozen six year-olds, passes Luke off
      to John.

 JOHN                  No, it really is fine. I can't thank
                 you enough for taking care of him.

 NICOLE                  It is our pleasure.    Wasn't it,
                 Carrie?

      John and Luke turn and walk toward the exit.

310 EXT. ZOO ENTRANCE -- CONTINUOUS 310 
      Lara turns and sees John and Luke walking toward her.

 LARA                  Hi.

 LUKE                  Hi.

 LARA                  Did you have a nice time at the party?

 LUKE                  Yeah.

      Lara walks him to the car, as if this day is no different
      than any other.

 LARA                  What was your favorite thing?

 LUKE                  Ice cream cake.

      She lifts him into his seat and buckles him in.

 LARA                  They had ice cream cake here?

 LUKE                  At Carrie's house.

 LARA                    My favorite.

      John starts the car.

 LARA (CONT'D)                    I'm going to sit back here, okay?

 JOHN                    Sure.

      Luke plays with a toy. Lara closes the door behind her.
      She looks out the window and sees:

      NICOLE standing at the entrance, looking at her.                        

      Not exactly sure why she does it, LARA offers her a grateful
      smile.

      NICOLE watches them pull away, confused about what she should
      do.

311 INT. SUV - ZOO PARKING LOT EXIT -- CONTINUOUS 311 
      John drifts up to the stop sign at the intersection. A sign
      points out the interstate to the left -- and he can see the             
      overpass and freeway entrance; the business district to the             
      right. He checks his watch: 48 minutes. He resets it to                 
      zero. Game over.                                                        

      He switches on the radio and searches for NEWS.

      Luke taps Lara on the shoulder.    She leans down.

 LUKE                    I think we're going to the cottage.

 LARA                    Really?

      He nods knowingly.

 LUKE                    I have money.

      Lara almost loses it; smiles.

 LARA                    Good.   Then I'll stick close to you.

 LUKE                    Okay.

      John finds the news station.

 NEWS RADIO                    -- Traffic down to two lanes at the
                   tollbooths. And downtown is worse.
                   Stay away from the train station if
                   you are trying to get anywhere. Not
                   sure what is happening but a KPGH                             
                   caller says trains aren't moving and
                   commuters are getting irate.
                       (etc.)

 LARA                    John?
                       (no reply)
                   What are we going to do?

 JOHN                        (finally)
                   We're going to the train station.

      John turns right, heading downtown.

312 INT. POLICE STATION -- DAY 312 
      Detective Quinn spots Harris fly in carrying a brimming green
      trash bag. Quinn jumps up and follows him into the SITUATION
      ROOM. COLLERO hurries to catch up.

      Harris dumps the contents onto the conference table as she
      enters. Quinn immediately dives into the contents. HARRIS
      and COLLERO share an awkward look.

 SGT. HARRIS                          (smitten)
                   Hi.

 DETECTIVE COLLERO                          (casting her eyes down)
                   Hi.

      She and Harris dig into the crumpled papers and photos.

 DETECTIVE QUINN                         (to Collero)
                   You're not going to nod off, are
                   you?

      Collero gives Quinn a burning look.    Nabulsi enters.

313 EXT. TRAIN STATION -- DAY 313 
      John double-parks and pulls on a ball cap. Traffic is
      snarled, the place is awash with police and squad cars.
      Hundreds of people mill out front.

 JOHN                    Stay in the car.

      John puts on his sunglasses and walks right through the middle
      of it all. Lara watches, certain he will be spotted and
      arrested.

      John steps onto the crowded sidewalk outside the front doors.
      He speaks to a large woman; she shakes her head. He goes on
      to speak to a black couple, who apparently aren't interested.
      He approaches an elderly couple.

314 EXT. INTERSTATE -- DAY 314 
      The SUV heads up the on-ramp.

315 INT. POLICE STATION - NABULSI'S OFFICE -- DAY 315 
      Nabulsi is on the phone, catching hell from his Captain, who            
      has had an earful from his counterpart in the State Police.             

 LT. NABULSI                    I understand....I understand. I
                   didn't tell them to stop EVERY
                   vehicle. Just the ones with a couple
                   and a young child.

      He hangs up, takes the quarter from his pocket and spins it
      on his desk.

316 INT./EXT. FREEWAY TOLLBOOTH -- DAY 316 
      John spies the tollbooth ahead, traffic down to two lanes.              
      The ELDERLY MAN beside him has a small bag on his lap.                  

 ELDERLY MAN                    Are you sure twenty dollars is enough?
                   Ticket to Buffalo costs three times
                   that.

      And now we notice the man's WIFE sitting in the back seat,
      with Luke and Lara. John pays the toll.

 JOHN                        (re: SUV)
                   This thing is very good on gas.

      A State Trooper waves them toward the booth.                                

      The trooper ahead checks them out and waves them on.       They             
      are free.

      The same trooper stops the car behind them -- in it, a couple               
      with a child.

317 INT. POLICE STATION - NABULSI'S OFFICE -- DAY 317 
 DETECTIVE COLLERO                    Every one in the state.

 LT. NABULSI                    You know what direction they are
                   going, smart ass?

 DETECTIVE COLLERO                    Captain, a lot of these places barely
                   have fax machines.

 LT. NABULSI                    Then start dialing.
                       (as they exit:)                                            
                   Prioritize. Closest airports first.                            

      Nabulsi spins the quarter again, staring at it as if it will
      give him the answer.

318 EXT. DOWNTOWN BUFFALO -- AFTERNOON 318 
      The Brennans drop off the elderly couple. John waves, drops                 
      his gun in the trash can, gets back in and drives away.                     

319 INT. POLICE STATION - SITUATION ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON 319

      Harris steps out into the HALL, passing an INTERVIEW ROOM.

      Behind the glass he sees QUINN grilling MICK. Harris keeps               
      going into Nabulsi's office. Nabulsi sits, spinning the
      coin, jacket off, shirt untucked.

 SGT. HARRIS                    You want to see it?

 LT. NABULSI                    Only if it will tell me where they
                   are.

 SGT. HARRIS                    Not so lucky.

      Nabulsi flattens the coin. Something makes him stare at his              
      fingers. He moves his hand, revealing a Canadian quarter.                

 LT. NABULSI                    How far is it to the Canadian border?

 SGT. HARRIS                    Four, five hours?

 LT. NABULSI                        (rising)

321 INT. POLICE STATION - SITUATION ROOM -- EVENING 321 
      Nabulsi comes out of his office, passing a waiting ERIT.

 ERIT                    Excuse me?   You call this coffee?

      Nabulsi shakes that off and enters the SITUATION ROOM. Every
      phone at the table is manned, all having the same conversation:

 SGT. HARRIS                    I'm calling from the Pittsburgh Police
                   Department. We have a fugitive
                   warrant for Lara and John Brennan,
                   they are most likely traveling with
                   their six year-old son, and we have
                   reason to believe they might be flying
                   out of your airport.

      Collero hangs up from her call and looks to the next number.

 LT. NABULSI                     How many airports in Ontario and
                    Quebec?

 DETECTIVE COLLERO                     Should I stop calling and count?

       Nabulsi gives her a look.      Collero dials.

 SGT. HARRIS                     Yes, we are sending you photographs.
                    We would appreciate it if you could
                    disseminate them....How many terminals?

 DETECTIVE QUINN                         (bursts in)
                    I got his parents!

325 INT. TORONTO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT -- NIGHT 325 
       John and Lara wait for Luke to step through the metal

       security agent takes Luke into the glass isolation booth.

326 INT. POLICE STATION - INTERVIEW ROOMS -- NIGHT 326 
       Collero questions Grace on the other side of the glass.       She

 DETECTIVE COLLERO                    So, you just decided to go for a

 GRACE                    George wanted to see the leaves.

      Track to the next room, where Nabulsi questions George.

 LT. NABULSI                    So you have absolutely no idea where
                   they are going?

 GEORGE                    I told you.    We never spoke.

      George stares Nabulsi down.

327 INT. TORONTO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT -- NIGHT 327 
      A female security agent searches Luke, digs a handful of
      Canadian quarters out of his pocket. John's heart races.

328 INT. TORONTO AIRPORT - PASSPORT CONTROL -- NIGHT 328 
      The Brennans approach passport control. Lara glances at
      John, sees he is sweating and red. She slips her hand into
      his and takes the passports.

 LARA                    I'll do this.

      She turns and smiles at the officer, putting on all her charm.

 LARA (CONT'D)                    Hello.

      He remains stern-faced. Taking their passports, he examines
      them against PHOTOGRAPHS on his computer screen. He looks
      at them, looks at the passports again, then finally waves
      them through.

 LARA (CONT'D)                    Thank you.

      As they step away, the passport officer turns, sees his
      replacement waiting. He stands and exits to take his break.

      The SECOND PASSPORT CONTROL OFFICER takes his seat and motions
      for the next traveler to approach. As they do an ALERT comes
      on his computer screen. He taps on it -- and up comes
      photographs of LARA and JOHN.

       He notes them, taps the screen again and the two take their
       place beside the others on the watch list. He motions for
       the traveler to hand over her passport.

329 INT. POLICE STATION - SITUATION ROOM -- NIGHT 329 
       The phones are quiet. Alone, Harris stares at the portion
       of the wall that he assembled. Collero enters.

 DETECTIVE QUINN                     Too bad you didn't find more of it.

 SGT. HARRIS                     Yeah. And wish I could figure out
                    where this is.

       He points to a small torn photo, taped back together.

 SGT. HARRIS (CONT'D)                     I checked websites for every tourist
                    destination I could --

 DETECTIVE COLLERO                     That's the presidential palace.
                        (Harris turns & stares)

       not to show how nervous he really is.

 AIRPORT SECURITY CHIEF (O.S.)                   Sorry. There is no one by their
                  description on the flight.

 LT. NABULSI                   They're on it. Do you have the

 YEAR-OLD GIRL.

 AIRPORT SECURITY CHIEF (V.O.)                   We have the photographs. They aren't

      Nabulsi looks at him as if he's nuts.

 DETECTIVE COLLERO                    I'll call the FBI.

      Collero exits, Quinn turns and looks at the partial "wall."

 DETECTIVE QUINN                    You ask yourself why we found this

       junkie. She runs off toward the sidewalk.                                  

344A QUINN - IN THE PRESENT 344A 
       Turns and sees...                                                          

344B LARA - IN THE PAST 344B 
       She hurries along the sidewalk to get out of the rain.                     
       Turning the corner into the garage she COLLIDES with the                   
       JUNKIE. Lara's purse catches the woman's coat.                             

       The JUNKIE puts her hand on Lara's shoulder, leaving a SMUDGE              
       OF ELIZABETH'S BLOOD on Lara's raincoat. She tugs free. A                  
       BUTTON from the woman's coat POPS OFF and hits the sidewalk.

       Lara turns and yells "Hey," then keeps going.

       She is about to get in the car when she sees the fire
       extinguisher in front of her left wheel. She picks it up,
       turns, annoyed. She places it down by the wall.



 (CONTINUED) 115. 
344B CONTINUED: 344B 
       Lara gets in her car and drives off, oblivious to Elizabeth's           
       body lying on the concrete floor on the passenger's side.

       Her co-worker sees her drive off as he steps into the garage.           
       He spots the body and turns and looks after Lara's car.                 

345 EXT. LARA'S OFFICE BUILDING - PARKING LOT -- DAY 345 
       Quinn puts his used gum in a wrapper. COLLERO watches from              
       the car as her partner walks to the corner of the building.             
       QUINN steps up to where the two women collided and looks                
       down at the sidewalk.                                                   

 DETECTIVE QUINN                     Was it raining when we searched the                        
                    crime scene?

 DETECTIVE COLLERO                     Three years ago?? What are we doing
                    here?

       Quinn drops his gum wrapper onto the sidewalk. It hits a                
       stream of water coming out from a rain gutter and washes                
       away. Quinn watches it -- then follows... Collero shakes                
       her head, grabs a newspaper to keep the rain off and follows.

       The gum wrapper washes over the curb into the gutter and                
       travels to the storm drain a half a block away.

       Quinn gets there, kneels.

 DETECTIVE QUINN                     Act like a cop. Grab the other side.

 DETECTIVE COLLERO                     You're out of your mind.

       Quinn jerks the grate up.    Collero grabs the other side and
       helps him lift.

       They stare down into the hole. Quinn runs his hand along
       the lip, digging up the mud and sediment...finds nothing.

 DETECTIVE COLLERO (CONT'D)                     You really thought you were going to
                    find it?

       Collero wipes her hands on a tissue as Quinn stares down the
       hole a little longer, then lets the grate fall.




 (CONTINUED) 116. 
345 CONTINUED: 345 
 CLOSE ON INSIDE LIP OF STORM DRAIN 
      Just before the grate clangs we see JUNKIE'S JACKET BUTTON,              
      squeezed between the grate and the wall.                                 

346 EXT. TOWN SQUARE - SOUTH AMERICA -- EVENING 346 
      The taxi crosses the ancient square of a small town.

347 INT. COLONIAL HOTEL -- EVENING 347 
      The room has two single beds. John waits at the bathroom
      door. Lara steps out, a real awkwardness between them.

      She touches his hand. He offers a smile. She slips past
      him. He steps into the bathroom and closes the door. Lara
      lies down on the single bed furthest from the bathroom, face
      to face with her sleeping son.

      Without warning, he kisses her on the cheek, for the first
      time, without being prodded. He turns around and lets her
      wrap her arms around him. And she almost dies of happiness.

348 INT. HOTEL BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS 348 
      John washes, trying not to look in the mirror, not wanting
      to glimpse the man he has become.

349 INT. HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT 349 
      Lara and Luke sleep, spooning. John sits on the other bed.
      He picks up the TV remote and flips through Spanish language
      stations. And there it is: CNN in English. Sports right
      now, but John knows there is no place they can hide.

350 INT. BAR -- DAY 350 
      Damon takes the money from John's wallet, leaves him with a
      twenty.

 DAMON                    Good luck.

      Damon leaves him there. As John wonders if he is capable of
      doing this, we cut to BLACK. Read:

               FADE IN:

               INT. UNION STATION - DAY - 12:06PM

               Union Station, that gorgeous fifty-year-old monument to Art 
               Deco/California Mission architecture. Still beautiful. Still 
               grand.

               A sign at one of the departure/arrival gates in the main 
               concourse-says the "San Diegan", number 2 64, is due at 12:00.

               Set above the gates, a big clock - six feet in diameter.

               THE TIME -

               12:06.

               We see the big hand slam into "7".

               A loudspeaker - you can just about understand this guy.

                                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         Amtrack 2 64, the San Diegan, from 
                         San Diego, Del Mar...

               EXT. UNION STATION PLATFORM - DAY - 12:06PM

               The "San Diegan" pulls into the terminal and comes to a slow, 
               grinding stop.

                                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         ...San Clemente, San Juan Capistrano, 
                         and Irvine is now arriving at Gate 
                         Nine.

               Doors are opened. Steps set down. Passengers pour out.

                                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         Amtrack 264 will be departing in 
                         fifteen minutes from Gate Nine for 
                         Oxnard, Ventura...

               INT. UNION STATION - DAY - 12:07PM

               A MAN and A WOMAN stand with a view of the arrival doors. 
               He's a blue-collar tough guy, dressed for church. She's his 
               beefy counterpart.

                                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         ...Santa Barbara, Lompoc...


               THE GUY (MR. SMITH) checks his watch.

                                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         ...Santa Maria, San Luis Obispo...

               Then he looks up to the big clock.

               12:07.

               The minute hand slams into the "8".

                                     ANNOUNCER
                         ...and points north.

               He resets his watch as DISEMBARKING PASSENGERS pour out of 
               the gate. PEOPLE run forward with kisses and hugs.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Look sharp.

               They stand like a couple of rocks, their eyes scanning the 
               crowd.

                                     MS. JONES
                         That one.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Nah.  Hates his wife.

               They're talking about a couple in their forties.  She 
               motormouths her way across the terminal and the husband 
               follows with the suitcases.

               WHOOSH! A couple of TEENAGE BOYS on rollerblades zip by.

                                     MS. JONES
                         I hate rollerblades.

               EXT. UNION STATION - PLATFORM - DAY - 12:08PM

               The train.. A PRETTY SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL (LYNN) , who is holding 
               a stuffed animal almost as large as she is, climbs down the 
               steps. She reaches the platform, looks around. From within 
               the train:

                                     GENE
                         Lynn!  Lynn!!


               GENE WATSON, thirtyish, a regular Joe in appearance and 
               inclination, appears above, carrying a couple small suitcases. 
               He takes a relieved breath when he sees  her.

                                     GENE
                         Lynn, don't walk ahead of me, OK?

               As he comes down the steps:

                                     GENE
                         I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of 
                         my sight, all right? I want you to 
                         stay right by me. Will you do that 
                         for me?

                                     LYNN
                         Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the 
                         platform and gives out an exaggerated 
                         sigh.

                                     GENE
                         We made it.

               LYNN nods back.

                                     LYNN
                         We made it.

               INT. UNION STATION - DAY - 12:08PM

               WHOOSH! A SECURITY GUARD approaches the two ROLLERBLADING 
               TEENS. They circle him, toss off a few taunts and roll away, 
               laughing.

               MR. SMITH and MS. JONES continue trolling the PASSENGERS as 
               they come through the gate.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Skate-boarders I don't mind, even 
                         though they dress like fuckin' idiots, 
                         but when I see some pin-head on 
                         rollerblades, I get the definite 
                         urge to grease the grill of my car 
                         with 'em.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Keep your eyes peeled.

                                     MS. JONES
                         What about them?


                                     MR. SMITH
                         Too old.

               They're talking about a COUPLE IN THEIR SIXTIES, warmly 
               greeting each other.

                                     MR. JONES
                         Him!

                                     MR. SMITH
                         If you ever had an idea it would die 
                         of malnutrition. First those blue 
                         hairs then some Spic.  Leave this to 
                         me. I know people. It's my job. I'm 
                         a people person.

               MR. SMITH laughs at his joke.

                                     MS. JONES
                         What the fuck are you looking for?

               MR. SMITH has spotted someone.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         I'm looking for them.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Where?

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Right there.

               He starts walking towards the exit gate.

               INT. UNION STATION -ARRIVAL CONCOURSE - DAY - 12:09PM

               GENE has emerged with LYNN. They pause there, getting their 
               bearings. Next to them, a YOUNG COUPLE is kissing. They can't 
               keep their hands off each other.

                                     GENE
                         I gotta make a phone call, Lynn. Do 
                         you see a phone?

               LYNN has seen the YOUNG COUPLE. She secretly points to them, 
               covers her mouth, and does a "tee, hee, hee" number. GENE 
               laughs.


                                     GENE
                         Come on, you.

               They start walking across the concourse, towards MR. SMITH 
               and MS. JONES.

                                     GENE
                              (to LYNN)
                         Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss 
                         like that?

                                     LYNN
                         On TV.

                                     GENE
                         You never saw your Mom and me kiss 
                         like that?

               LYNN suddenly gets very sad. She looks at the ground, slows 
               down. GENE notices. He stops, crouches down to her level. 
               MR. SMITH and MS. JONES, nearing them, split apart, move 
               around them, and keep going.

                                     GENE
                              (to LYNN)
                         Hey, it's OK to talk about her. You 
                         can talk about her all you want. You 
                         know that, don't you?

               LYNN nods.

                                     GENE
                         So, come on. You never saw us kiss 
                         like that?

                                     LYNN
                         No way.

                                     GENE
                         How did you see us kiss?

               LYNN gives her own hand a little peck of a kiss.

                                     GENE
                         That's it? That little peck of a 
                         kiss? Oh, brother, you missed some 
                         kisses.


               LYNN laughs and throws herself on her dad. He holds her to 
               him, looks to the sky for help.. He finds himself staring at 
               the big clock.

               12:10.

                                     GENE
                         Ooh, I'm gonna be late. I gotta call.

               INT. UNION STATION - DAY - 12:10PM

               MR. SMITH and MS. JONES are making a beeline for their target: 
               the YOUNG KISSING COUPLE.

               WHOOSH! The-ROLLERBLADING TEENS almost collide with them. 
               MS. JONES wants to do something about it, but MR. SMITH pulls 
               her along. They have a mission to complete. They close in on 
               the couple.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Look at 'em. He'd do anything for 
                         her.-

                                     MS. JONES
                         Young love.

               The couple are murmuring sweet talk between kisses. The words 
               themselves are unclear until MR. SMITH and MS. JONES are 
               only a few feet away. French. They are speaking French. MR. 
               SMITH makes an instant one-eighty turn. MS. JONES follows.

                                     MR. SMITH
                              (sotto voce)
                         Foreigners! Fuck!

                                     MS. JONES
                         Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and 
                         when we need their help in Kuwait, 
                         where the fuck are they?

               MR. SMITH looks at the partner he's been saddled with.

               INT. UNION STATION - PAY PHONE AREA - DAY - 12:10PM

               GENE has found a pay phone. He keeps an eye on LYNN who has 
               wandered a few yards away.


                                     GENE
                         Hello, is Mr. Conners there? I have 
                         an interview with him at twelve-
                         thirty. Hi, Mr. Conners, this is 
                         Gene Watson. Sorry to call you at 
                         the last minute like this but... 
                         Hey, hey!

               He reacts to the ROLLERBLADING TEENS who swoop past LYNN, 
               one on each side, too close for a father's comfort.

                                     GENE
                         Watch that! Lynn, come here!

               She does. He keeps an eye on the TEENS, who, having found a 
               victim, are circling around, passing MR. SMITH and .MS. JONES. 
               MR. SMITH has noticed GENE.

               GENE at the phone.

                                     GENE
                         Sorry. There's some crazy kids on 
                         skates. Listen, the train just got 
                         in, I'm afraid I'm going to be a few 
                         minutes late.

               The TEENS make their pass, flip him the bird, engage in other 
               objectionable behavior, begin to circle again. MR. SMITH 
               watches GENE watch the TEENS, then notice a sturdy, sand-
               filled ashtray next to him.

                                     GENE
                         Great. OK, I'll get there as soon as 
                         I can. Bye, now.

               He hangs up. Keeping one eye on the circling TEENS.

                                     GENE
                              (to LYNN)
                         Ready?

                                     LYNN
                         Nods.

                                     GENE
                         Let' s do it.

               He picks up a suit-case and accidently-on-purpose uses it to 
               knock over the ashtray, just as the TEENS approach. The 
               ashtray spills its Load of sand into their path. When they 
               hit it, their skates stop, they don't. They sprawl, doing 
               nasty things to knees and wrists.


                                     GENE
                         Whoops.

               He stands over them with LYNN.

                                     GENE
                         Now, see, this is why you should 
                         always wear a helmet and knee pads. 
                         You never know when you're going to 
                         fall down and go boom. Right?

                                     LYNN
                         Right.

               ANGLE ON MR. SMITH AND MS. JONES. - 12:11PM

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Perfect.

               He starts forward.

                                     MS. JONES
                              (not so sure)
                         Perfect.

               She follows. They intercept GENE. MR. SMITH flashes a badge.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Could I see some identification, 
                         sir?

                                     GENE
                         What?

                                     MS. JONES
                              (ditto with the badge)
                         I.D. Could we see some?

                                     GENE
                         Uh, sure. What's, what's the problem? 
                         Will a driver's license do?

                                     MR. SMITH
                         That'll do just fine.

               GENE pulls out his wallet, surprised and confused. MR. SMITH 
               looks at it.


                                     GENE
                         Is this about those kids? Look, I'm 
                         sorry about that. But they darn 
                         near...

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?

                                     GENE
                         Yes.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Where's that?

                                     GENE
                         Near Lompoc, north. What's...

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Come with us, sir.

                                     GENE
                         I'd like to know what...

                                     MR."SMITH
                         Don't cause a ruckus, sir.

               He pulls open his coat, putting his hands on his hips, not-
               so coincidentally revealing the butt of a holstered gun.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You don't want to cause a ruckus, 
                         with the little girl and all.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Come with me, honey.

               MS. JONES swoops LYNN up and heads for the station entrance.

                                     GENE
                         Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take 
                         the girl!

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Don't worry. She's good with kids.

               GENE hurries after MS. JONES. MR. SMITH grabs up the 
               suitcases.


               INT. UNION STATION - SOUVENIR SHOP - DAY - 12:11PM

               MS. JONES nears a souvenir stand. The OWNER is looking the 
               other way. Without breaking stride, MS. JONES reaches out, 
               snatches a child's coloring book and crayons.

                                     LYNN
                         You stole that.

                                     MS. JONES
                         No, I didn't. I confiscated it. 
                         There's a difference.

               And they're out the door, GENE hurrying after. The big hand 
               on the big clock moves.

               12:12.

               EXT. UNION STATION PARKING LOT - DAY - 12:12PM

               MS. JONES heads for-a van with smoked windows. She gets inside 
               with LYNN. GENE stops a few feet away.

                                     GENE
                         What is going on?

               MR. SMITH prods him in the ribs.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Into the van, Mr. Watson. Front seat.

               GENE looks desperately around for help. There is none. He 
               lets MR. SMITH push him toward the van.

               INT. VAN -.DAY - 12:13PM

               LYNN and MS. JONES are in the back.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Let's get your seatbelt on. Always 
                         gotta wear your seatbelt, isn't that 
                         right?

               LYNN resists.

                                     LYNN
                         I want my daddy.


               GENE climbs into the front passenger seat.

                                     MS. JONES
                         There's your daddy. See? We're your 
                         daddy's friends.

               MR. SMITH climbs into the driver's seat.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         That's right. The policeman is your 
                         friend. Isn't that right, Daddy?

               GENE looks down. MR.. SMITH has pulled his gun. He points it 
               casually so it's aiming through the seat in the general 
               direction of the little girl.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Daddy?

                                     GENE
                         Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our 
                         friends.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Hey, would you look at this crazy 
                         car? Everybody has their own radio. 
                         What do you think of that?

                                     LYNN
                         Everybody does?

                                     MS. JONES
                         Yep. And you can listen to it without 
                         anybody else listening. Let's try it 
                         out.

               She puts some ear phones on her. She holds up the plug-in 
               end.

                                     MS. JONES
                         This is what they call the jack. Hi, 
                         Jack!

                                     LYNN
                         Laughs.

                                     MS. JONES
                         It goes in that little hole.


                                     LYNN
                         Let me do it.

               She plugs the jack in. MS. JONES turns on the radio. LYNN 
               gets a big smile on her face.

                                     LYNN
                              (loudly)
                         It's loud!

               She goes to work, playing with the radio, changing stations, 
               etc., oblivious to all else.

                                     MS JONES
                         Removes a Pro Label Machine from 
                         under the seat. She begins to type 
                         in several characters.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Let's get down to business.

                                     GENE
                         Who are you? You're not the police.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Brilliant.

               MS JONES presses PRINT on the Labeller. A strip of plastic 
               emerges that she begins to apply to a Name Tag.  He looks 
               back to her. MR. SMITH whacks him on the knee with the gun. 
               It hurts.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay 
                         attention and your daughter won't be 
                         hurt.

                                     GENE
                         You wouldn't...

                                     MS. JONES
                         Try us.

               He looks back. She is caressing LYNN's hair.

                                     GENE
                         Get your hands off her.

               He makes a move. MR. SMITH whacks his knee again, harder.


                                     MR. SMITH
                         Mr. Watson, you're not paying 
                         attention. Your daughter's life 
                         depends on you. Do you understand 
                         that?

               GENE looks from MR. SMITH to MS. JONES and back. He's having 
               a hard time focussing.

               She slips the NameTag into a manila envelope beside her MR. 
               SMITH Do you understand?

                                     GENE
                         Yes, yes, I understand.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Good.

               He takes the manila envelope from MS JONES, tosses it in 
               GENE'S lap.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         This is for you. In it there is a 
                         picture of a woman and an itinerary. 
                         It is her itinerary. She is presently - 
                         are you listening, Mr. Watson?

                                     GENE
                         Yes, I'm listening.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         She is presently at the Bonaventure 
                         Hotel. That's right near here.

               He gestures. GENE looks. The glassy Bonaventure Hotel is 
               glimpsed surrounded by taller, newer high-rises.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         When you leave this van you will get 
                         yourself a cab and take it to the 
                         Bonaventure Hotel. Then you will 
                         take this.  

               MR. SMITH holds up his hand, snaps his fingers. From the 
               back, MS. JONES hands him a cloth-wrapped bundle. He puts it 
               in GENE's hand, shows him what it is: a gun.


                                     MR. SMITH
                         ...and you will kill the woman whose 
                         picture is in there. Not just shoot 
                         her, mind,! kill her. I'd recommend 
                         you empty the gun into her. Close 
                         up. Got all that?

               It takes a moment for it all to sink into GENE'S brain.

                                     GENE
                         You're out of your mind.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         What's your point?

                                     GENE
                         I will do no such thing.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.

               A "snap!" from the back seat. GENE looks. MS. JONES has broken 
               a carrot stick. She breaks another.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Don't worry. We'll take good care of 
                         the kid.

               She gives half the carrot stick to LYNN, pops the other half 
               in her mouth and grinds it to pulp. MR. SMITH is checking 
               his watch.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         It is now 12:16. If the woman in the 
                         picture is alive at 1:30...
                              (holds up a walkie-
                              talkie)
                         ...I call my partner, your daughter 
                         is dead.

               He looks in the rear-view mirror to MS. JONES.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         And what happens if I don't call 
                         you?

                                     MS. JONES
                         I kill her anyway.


                                     MR. SMITH
                         Did you hear that, Mr. Watson? Do 
                         you understand?

               He taps the manila envelope.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         The woman in the picture...

               He indicates the back seat with his head.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         ...or your daughter.

               GENE looks at his daughter.

                                     GENE
                         Oh, my God...

               MR. SMITH reaches over, puts the gun and manila envelope 
               into GENE'S pockets.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         God can't help her, Mr. Watson. Only 
                         you can help her.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Only you.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You're wasting time.

               He reaches across GENE, opens the door and pushes him out, 
               then follows him. LYNN takes off the ear-phones, tries to 
               undo her seatbelt.

                                     LYNN
                         Where is my daddy going?

               MS. JONES wraps a big arm around her.

                                     MS. JONES
                         He's going to help the police. Your 
                         daddy is going to be a hero.

                                     LYNN
                         My daddy is going to be a hero? Like 
                         Power Rangers?


                                     MS. JONES
                         Just like Power Rangers.

               EXT. UNION STATION PARKING'LOT - DAY - 12:18PM

               MR. SMITH activates the walkie-talkie, speaks into it.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Let's test this thing. You on?

               He holds it up for GENE to hear.

                                     MS. JONES (O.S.)
                              (filtered)
                         Reading you.

               MR. SMITH still has GENE'S wallet. He opens it, pulls out 
               some cash, puts it in GENE's breast pocket.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You'11 need some cash.
                              (re: the wallet)
                         I'll hang onto this for the time 
                         being. Oh, and...

               He grabs one of GENE's hands.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You'll need these.

               He dumps six bullet's into GENE's palm from a cloth Chivas 
               Regal bag.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Get moving, Mr. Watson. Time's a 
                         wastin'.

               GENE just stands there, transfixed by the bullets in his 
               hand. MR. SMITH reaches out, turns him around and gives him 
               a shove away from the van and into the midst of...

               EXT. UNION STATION - PARKING LOT - BUS STOP - DAY - 12:19PM

               ...a LARGE CROWD OF TOURISTS, that have just exited an 
               arriving mini-bus. GENE is caught up in the crowd and carried 
               along like a leaf in a stream.

               Amid the chattering CROWD, GENE is pushed along as if in a 
               trance. He touches the pocket with the gun. He looks at the


               Bullets in his hand, then at the people around him. It's 
               like a splash of cold water. He quickly pockets the bullets, 
               turns and pushes against the tide of tourists. They resist 
               him, pushing him along until he breaks free and can see...

               The van is gone!

               ANGLE ON GENE -- 12:19PM

               He stands there, a lost man. Fear sweeps over him. He looks 
               desperately around. He is within himself, oblivious to his 
               surroundings, his mind racing, his face a tangle of emotions. 
               He is a man alone in a crowd. He takes a step.

               A LITTLE LATINO GIRL, chased by HER BROTHER, runs into GENE'S 
               legs. He instinctively grabs her before she can fall, finds 
               himself, crouched down, holding her by the arms. His heart 
               plunges - she isn't Lynn. His intensity scares her.

                                     LITTLE GIRL
                         Mama!

               She pulls away, flees to HER MOTHER, who hoists her up, 
               reprimanding her in Spanish. GENE stays crouched, watching 
               the LITTLE GIRL staring at him over HER MOTHER'S shoulder.

               Until a COP crosses his line of sight. A LOS ANGELES TRANSIT 
               POLICEMAN, foot-patrolling the station.

               It's like a gift from above. Relief floods GENE's face. He 
               is saved. He stands, hurries toward the COP, each step more 
               confident.

               Then, just beyond the COP, MR. SMITH casually slides into 
               view, pointedly holding the walkie-talkie. GENE walks right 
               past the COP heading towards a cab stand. MR. SMITH falls in 
               behind him speaking in his ear.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You talk to a cop, you even look at 
                         a cop too long and your daughter is 
                         dead.
                              (into walkie-talkie)
                         Do it.

                                     MS. JONES (O.S.)
                              (filtered)

                              (filtered)
                         Lynn calling Daddy. Lynn calling 
                         Daddy. Come in, Daddy.

               GENE grabs at the walkie-talkie like a drowning man.

                                     GENE
                         Lynn!

                                     LYNN (V.O.)
                              (filtered)
                         I can hear you good. Can you hear 
                         me?

                                     GENE
                         Yes. Yes, I can hear you.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         That's enough.

                                     MS. JONES (V.O.)
                              (filtered)
                         'Daddy has to go now.

                              (filtered)
                         He has to say "over and out". Daddy, 
                         you have to say "over and out".

                                     GENE
                         Over and out.

               MR. SMITH clicks off the walkie-talkie.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Look at your watch. Look at it! At 
                         one-thirty your little girl is dead. 
                         Say it with me. At one-thirty my 
                         little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!

                                     GENE
                              (softly)
                         At one thirty my little girl is dead.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Unless you do what you're told. Go 
                         do it!


               He pushes GENE on, toward a cab.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         And don't forget I'll be watching 
                         you.

               GENE looks back at him, full of impotent rage. MR. SMITH 
               raises the walkie-talkie. GENE reaches the first cab at the 
               stand.

               EXT. UNION STATION - CAB STAND - DAY - 12:21PM

               The CABBIE, talking to ANOTHER DRIVER, throws away his 
               cigarette, ambles over to the Driverside-of the cab.

                                     CABBIE
                         Where to, sir?

                                     GENE
                         The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure 
                         Hotel. Do you know where that is?

               The CABBIE is disappointed, but he nods and GENE gets into 
               the cab.

               INT. CAB - DAY - 12:21PM

               The CABBIE gets in and they take off. GENE stares at the 
               manila envelope in his hand. He starts to open it, is stopped 
               by:

                                     CABBIE
                         Amtrack?

                                     GENE
                         What?

                                     CABBIE
                         You just come in on Amtrack?

                                     CABBIE
                         Oh, San Diego? I've thought about 
                         moving to San Diego.  It's hard to 
                         make a living in this town. These 
                         short hops.  Can't make a dime on 
                         'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can 
                         make a buck. These little hops cost 
                         me money.

                                     GENE
                         Sorry.

                         'S okay. What do you think?

                                     GENE
                         Huh?

                                     CABBIE
                         Better in San Diego? More opportunity 
                         there? What?

                                     GENE
                         I really don't know. I don't live 
                         there. I was just visiting...a grave.

                                     CABBIE
                         Aw, too bad.

               They lapse into silence. GENE starts to open the envelope 
               again.

                                     CABBIE
                         Somebody close?

                                     GENE
                         What?

                                     CABBIE
                         The grave. Somebody close?


                                     GENE
                         Wife. Ex-wife. Almost ex. We were 
                         separated. She was thinking about a 
                         divorce.

               GENE notices the dashboard clock -

               12:22

               GENE leans forward.

                                     GENE
                         Look...I've... I've got a problem. A 
                         big problem...

                                     CABBIE
                         Oh, yeah?

               He hits the horn and swerves to the left.

                                     CABBIE
                         Jesus! Watch it, buddy!

               EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET - DAY - 12:22PM

               GENE looks out his window and finds himself staring at MR. 
               SMITH, staring back at him, driving the van, next to him. He 
               throws himself back in the seat.

               INT. CAB - DAY - 12:22PM

               The cab pulls into the drive front of the Bonaventure Hotel 
               and stops.

                                     CABBIE
                         I'd love to hear about your problem, 
                         but the ride's over. Three-fifty.

               GENE looks out the back window, watches the van pulls up to 
               the curb on the other side of the street.

                                     CABBIE
                         Three-fifty. I hope your problem 
                         doesn't have anything to do with my 
                         three-fifty.

               GENE looks back at the CABBIE, waiting for his fare.


                                     GENE
                         Right. Right.

               GENE digs through his pockets and comes up with one of his 
               business cards. He hurriedly writes on it: "HELP. VAN KIDNAP 
               CHILD." He wraps a five around it, pushes it into the CABBIE'S 
               hand, gives him a meaningful look and gets out of the cab.

               EXT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - DAY - 12:23PM

               GENE stops a few yards from the cab, watching the CABBIE.

               INT. CAB - DAY - 12:23PM

               The CABBIE finds the secreted card, but looks at the wrong 
               side.

                                     CABBIE
                         What do I want with an accountant?

               A DOORMAN leans down at the window.

                                     DOORMAN
                         I got one for the airport. You free?

                                     CABBIE
                         You bet.

               The DOORMAN plants a PASSENGER in the cab. As he pulls away, 
               the CABBIE again glances at the business card, crumples it 
               up.

               EXT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - DAY - 12:23PM

               GENE watches the cab leave. As it exits, the CABBIE's arm 
               snakes out and tosses the card in the trash. GENE knows what 
               it is. He looks around.

               VALETS, BELLMEN, ARRIVALS and DEPARTEES, cars coming and 
               going. No one pays particular attention to him.

               GENE looks at the van across the street. MR. SMITH gets out 
               and walks across the street towards him. The van drives away.

               GENE watches the van disappear around the corner, desperately 
               hanging onto the last glimpse of it.


               MR. SMITH takes the walkie-talkie out of his pocket. GENE 
               goes into the hotel.

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 12:24PM

               GENE enters. It's like another world. A busy, humming, air-
               conditioned planet. PEOPLE hustle around the restaurants, 
               waterfalls - a definite ant farm ambiance.

               HIGH DOWN ANGLE ON GENE - LOBBY - DAY - 12:24PM

               Suddenly we have cut to a VIDEO IMAGE of Gene looking around 
               this Hotel, complete with scrolling TIME AND DATE. Shot by 
               someone high above.

               CLOSE ON GENE - LOBBY - DAY - 12:24PM

               GENE is bumped and buffeted about by the bustling crowd. He 
               breaks free to a clear spot, looks up and freezes. Then he 
               starts tracking all around him, seeing...something.

                                     GENE
                         Oh, my God. Oh, no.

               He desperately fumbles in his pocket.

               Facing and above him, some WORKMEN ON LADDERS are securing a 
               huge, rolled up banner.

               GENE finds what he's looking for - the manila envelope. He 
               rips it open. As he pulls out the photograph that is inside, 
               the WORKMEN let their banner unfurl. We do a simultaneous 
               reveal. The woman in the photograph in the envelope is the 
               same as depicted on the banner. Written across the bottom of 
               it in your best red, white, and blue:

                         "RE-ELECT ELEANOR SAMARA GRANT GOVERNOR"

               And an addendum:

                                      "HERE TODAY!"

                                     GENE
                         Oh, shit.

               It dawns on him. He looks around him again. This time we see 
               what he sees. Campaign posters and banners everywhere. 


               On some of them she is posed with a handsome man, several 
               years her junior. These have the caption, "Governor Grant 
               and husband Brendan".

                                     GENE
                         Oh, sweet Jesus...

               His eyes fall on MR. SMITH, standing inside the entrance, 
               walkie-talkie in hand, watching him.

               GENE looks at a poster, at MR. SMITH, who smiles, nods and 
               gives GENE a move of the head - "Get to it."

               GENE shoves the photograph away as if it could incriminate 
               him, then slides out the itinerary.

               The itinerary says "California Educators' Association - 12:00 
               noon - Emerald Bay Room - Opening Address - Governor Eleanor 
               Samara Grant".

               GENE checks his watch.

               12:26.

               He looks around him at the confusion and spots a Bellboy, 
               GUSTINO, who's cleaning out ashtrays.

                                     GENE
                         Could you tell me where the Emerald 
                         Bay Room is?

               GUSTINO points up.

                                     GUSTINO
                         Third floor. Yellow stairwell. Follow 
                         the signs.

               GENE turns away without a word, starts to walk, then turns 
               back.

                                     GENE
                         Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.

               GUSTINO smiles.

                                     GUSTINO
                         No problem.


               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - "YELLOW STAIRWELL" - DAY - 12:26PM

               GENE mounts a set of stairs that will take him to the third       
               floor. MR. SMITH follows him as he climbs.

               INT. "YELLOW STAIRWELL" - DAY - 12:2 6PM

               The whole lobby and entrance of the hotel are seen as Gene 
               ascends.

               GENE forces himself not to look at MR. SMITH behind him. His 
               nerves are rising in anticipation of his destination.

               INT. THIRD FLOOR - DAY - 12:26PM

               GENE sees the arrow and sign for the Emerald Bay Room.  He 
               walks that way. MR. SMITH follows.

               INT. THIRD FLOOR - SHOP ARCADE AREA - DAY - 12:27PM

               GENE and MR. SMITH pass gift shops, snack bars. The walkway 
               is crowded and GENE is going against the tide of REPORTERS, 
               POLITICIANS, SUPPORTERS, and just a lot of PEOPLE WITH NAME 
               TAGS.

               GENE plows on through...

               ...and runs smack into BRENDAN GRANT.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                              (laughs)
                         Whoops!

               The two men reel back from each other. A SECURITY MAN, 
               earphones and gray suit, steps immediately between them. 
               BRENDAN GRANT is a charmingly smooth man.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         Nice body check.

               He continues on, talking to an ATTRACTIVE WCMAN COMPANION.

               BRENDAN GRANT What the Governor really admires, Mrs. Wentzel, 
               and Eleanor has said this to me on more than one occasion, 
               are pecple like you who take a personal tragedy and turn it 
               into a positive force.


               He slides a familiar hand around her waist.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         You know my wife has a deeply personal 
                         reason for going after repeat drunk 
                         drivers. They are felons and they 
                         should be treated as such. A drivers 
                         license is a privilege, not a right.

               And he is hustled away. Right past an election poster 
               featuring him and Governor Grant.

               Still stunned by the encounter, GENE turns back and watches 
               the Governor's husband, but keeps walking.

               INT. EMERALD BAY ROOM - DAY - 12:28PM

               It is emptying, that's where the crowd came from. GENE comes 
               in.

               A WOMAN is heading for the door with a centerpiece she's 
               just copped.

                                     GENE
                         Excuse me, is the...thing over?

                                     WOMAN
                         Yes. You didn't miss much. The 
                         food...chicken again.

                                     GENE
                         Eleanor Grant is gone?

                                     WOMAN
                         Yes. Nice speech. But it's the same 
                         at all these...

               But GENE has turned away. The WOMAN gives him a face, grabs 
               another centerpiece and exits. A CLEAN-UP CREW is starting 
               to go through the room. GENE leans against a wall, breathing 
               through a combination of relief and agony.

               MR. SMITH is suddenly next to him.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Check your itinerary. Move along.


               GENE gets out the itinerary. "12:30 - 12:45 - Hors d'oeuvres/ 
               Buffet w/Friends of Eleanor Samara Grant - INVITATION ONLY -
               Bona Vista Lounge".

                                     GENE
                         This says "invitation only".

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Of course you're invited. You're a 
                         big donor to the campaign. They love 
                         you.

               MR SMITH digs  into the manila envelope, comes out with a 
               handful of security badges, name tags, invites. He plucks 
               the name tag that MS JONES printed earlier. It has a red 
               ribbon signifying a Major Donor to the Campaign. He fastens 
               it to Gene's lapel.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red 
                         Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.

                                     GENE
                         Where did you get these? Who are 
                         you?

                                     MR. SMITH
                         I'm the guy who's going to kill your 
                         daughter if you don't get moving.

               INT. LOBBY ENTRANCE TO THE "RED" ELEVATOR - DAY - 12:28PM

               GENE approaches. He notices a flurry of movement, a small 
               GROUP OF PEOPLE moving determinedly through the lobby. It is 
               GOVERNOR ELEANOR GRANT with a small entourage!  She is a 
               handsome woman in her fifties. The entourage consists of 
               KRISTA BROOKS, Eleanor's, late-twenties assistant, a few 
               assorted POLITICAL AIDES and a couple of PEOPLE WITH NAME 
               TAGS. GENE is not sure what to do. The group reaches the 
               elevator. KRISTA pushes the button.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         They-didn't hear a word I said. The 
                         mike was too low on the podium.

                                     KRISTA
                         How much did we pay for that room?


                                     CHIEF AIDE
                         We didn't.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Somebody did.

               KRISTA turns to an Aide.

                                     KRIST
                         A Have Nolin pre-check the PA systems.

               The elevator doors open. They crowd in. The doors start to 
               close.

               Gene looks around, where did Mr. Smith go?

               GENE springs forward, thrusts his hand between them. The 
               doors stop, then bounce open. GENE is startled, finding 
               himself face to face with a cold eyed bodyguard.

                                     BODYGUARD
                         Excuse me, sir, this car is for the 
                         Governor. You can take the next one.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Don't you dare, Franco. This is one 
                         of our biggest supporters.

               She smiles charmingly, offers her hand to GENE.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Eleanor Grant, gubernatorial 
                         incumbent. That's a mouthful isn't- 
                         it? I love saying that.

               GENE steps aboard, shakes her hand.

               INT. "RED ELEVATOR" - DAY - 12:29PM

               The elevator begins to rise.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Whose idea was it to have a lunch 
                         right after the brunch? I'm about to 
                         bust as it is.
 

                                     KRISTA
                         We'll just walk through, do a little 
                         grip-and-grin, then get ready for 
                         the press con.

               INSERT FLOOR INDICATOR

               We are on the third floor.

               The doors have closed and the elevator begins to rise.

                                     GENE
                         Governor...

               It comes out a little louder then he intended. He has turned, 
               his back to the door. Everyone looks at him. He's committed.

                                     GENE
                         I need your help.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         What can I do for you Mr....Watson?

                                     GENE
                         Its'...ah...about my daughter....

               The elevator slows and stops on the next floor above.

               INSERT FLOOR INDICATOR

               We are on the fourth floor.

               Behind GENE, the doors open.

                                     MR. SMITH (O.S.)
                         Room for one more?

               GENE freezes.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         I think we can accommodate you.

               She offers her hand to MR. SMITH as he steps on board.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Eleanor Grant, gubernatorial 
                         incumbent.
 

                                     MR. SMITH
                         A pleasure to meet you, Governor.

               The car begins to rise again. ELEANOR .GRANT turns back to 
               GENE.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         You were saying?  Your daughter....?

                                     GENE
                         I...

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Yes?

               ANGLE ON MR SMITH

               Yes???

               ANGLE ON GENE

               What to do now?

                                     GENE
                         She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure 
                         to get your autograph.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Of course.  I wish everything were 
                         that easy.

                                     KRISTA
                         I've got the pen if you've got the 
                         paper.

               GENE looks at her. She smiles back.

                                     KRISTA
                         How about that?

               He looks at what she refers to: the manila envelope he holds, 
               the one MR. SMITH gave him.

                                     KRISTA
                         Is that something precious?

                                     GENE
                         No, that's,..that's fine
 

               He gives it to ELEANOR GRANT. KRISTA hands over the pen. 
               GENE's eyes flick over to MR. SMITH who is staring at the 
               envelope.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         What's her name?

               GENE looks at the Governor, only inches away, back to MR. 
               SMITH, who raises his eyes, nods, his silent message curt -
               do it! GENE pulls his eyes away.

                                     GENE
                         Her name? Her name is Lynn.

               ELEANOR GRANT writes the autograph. MR. SMITH'S eyes drill 
               into him. GENE looks over. MR. SMITH raises a hand to his 
               face, pretends to scratch an itch. His other hand taps his 
               wristwatch. GENE's hand slides toward his jacket pocket.  
               Sweat beads on his forehead. He's barely aware of KRISTA 
               talking to him.

                                     KRISTA
                         It's funny. I don't even keep a pad 
                         of paper with me anymore, everything's 
                         gone so electronic.

               He gives her a quick, weak smile. His free hand wipes the 
               sweat from his face.

                                     KRISTA
                         If it wasn't for double A batteries 
                         I'd be in big trouble.

               He is slowly reaching into the pocket with the gun, but stops 
               when he notices MR. SMITH'S hand slide into his jacket, where 
               his gun is.

               He looks at the other MR. SMITH, earphone, crewcut-Security. 
               There is the hint of a gun on his hip.

               GENE's eyes widen, dart to MR. SMITH'S face, his hand sliding 
               into his coat. His hand hovers over his gun, trembling. Is 
               the SECURITY MAN staring at him?

               ELEANOR GRANT hands over the autograph.
 

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Are you all right? Elevators make me 
                         queasy, too.

               GENE gives her a sick smile, abruptly turns away. He takes 
               his hand out of his pocket. It's shaking. He clenches it to 
               stop the shakes.

               The doors open, startling him.

               INT. THIRTY-FIFTH FLOOR - DAY - 12:2 9PM

               ELEANOR GRANT and her entourage exit to greetings and 
               applause.

               GENE stays in the elevator, frozen, alone with MR. SMITH.

               The doors close and the elevator descends.

               INT. "RED ELEVATOR" - DAY - 12:29PM

               MR. SMITH is fuming, his face red. He explodes.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         She was right in front of you! What's 
                         wrong with you!?

               His fists clench. He seems about to lose control. He backs 
               GENE into a corner, physically terrified.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Are you 'fucking with me!?

                                     GENE
                         The gun...

                                     MR. SMITH
                         What about the gun?

                                     GENE
                         It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the 
                         bullets in it.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You...

               He raises a fist. Struggles with the impulse to smash GENE, 
               controls it. Angrily, he takes the gun from GENE's pocket, 
               expertly loads it with bullets from his own pocket.
 

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You won't get many chances like that, 
                         Mr. Watson. That's the way life works. 
                         Don't blow the next one.

               He indicates the glass,wall of the elevator with his eyes. 
               GENE looks out and down.

               GENE'S POV

               The van. It's moving into a parking spot across from the 
               Bonaventure, on Flower Street.

               INT. THE VAN - DAY - 12:29PM

               LYNN is coloring a picture in her stolen book. MS. JONES 
               takes a look.

                                     MS. JONES
                         That's pretty good.

                                     LYNN
                         I've done much better ones than this.

                                     MS. JONES
                         You have, huh?

                                     LYNN
                         Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much 
                         more colors at home.

                                     MS. JONES
                         That's good.
                              (checks her watch)
                         That's good, sweetie pie.

               INT. RED ELEVATOR - DAY - 12:29PM

               The elevator continues its descent and the van disappears 
               from view. GENE strains to see it again, but it's impossible.

               MR. SMITH jams the loaded gun into GENE's pocket.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         There, all loaded. Ready for the 
                         hunt.

               The elevator, doors open into the lobby.


               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR - YELLOW ELEVATOR LOBBY - 
               DAY - 12:29PM

               MR. SMITH walks out. GENE follows. MR. SMITH, suddenly becomes 
               self-conscious, walks away from GENE. The object of his 
               shyness: A JAPANESE TOURIST COUPLE nearby. The man is taping 
               his wife with a video camera.

               VIEW THROUGH VIDEO CAMERA - 12:31PM

               We see what the camera is seeing, the WIFE, smiling. Behind 
               her, we see GENE, looking confusedly after Mr. Smith.  He 
               turns, walks out of frame. In the corner of the picture, a 
               read-out of the TIME:

               12:31:00.

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOESHINE STAND - DAY - 12:31PM

               Back in real life, GENE walks toward a shoeshine stand outside 
               the Men's Room. "Huey's Polished Act" and below that, hand-
               lettered, "Disabled Veteran" where HUEY himself, a fiftyish 
               black man, reads a "Smithsonian" magazine.

               He sees GENE and perks up - a customer.

                                     HUEY
                         Having a rough day? Down at the heels 
                         as they...?

               But GENE goes right past HUEY and into the Men's Room.

                                     HUEY
                              (calling after him)
                         You don't see your face, you don't 
                         pay!

               HUEY gives up, goes back to his magazine.

               INT. MEN'S ROOM. - DAY - 12:31PM

               Gene goes- over to one of the sinks, runs the cold water, 
               splashes his face, looks in the mirror, into his own eyes.  
               He tries to find an answer, a way out. A pay phone, on the 
               wall behind him, comes into focus. Then a hand reaches in, 
               grabs the receiver...and yanks it, snapping the wire.  Gene 
               spins around.  It is MR. SMITH, of course.
 

               MR. SMITH smiles. GENE doesn't. MR. SMITH leaves.

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR - DAY

               GENE exits the Men's Room and walks back the route he came.

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOESHINE STAND - DAY - 12:32PM

               HUEY sets down his magazine again.

                                     HUEY
                         Having a rough day? Down at the heels 
                         as they say? What you need is a shoe 
                         shine, shoe shine, shoe shine today.

               It's HUEY's usual patter, he's said it a thousand times. 
               GENE looks around.

               MR. SMITH is in the lounge area, facing the Flower Street 
               entrance, able to keep the Men's Room and GENE in view.

                                     HUEY
                         Take ten, take a break, take a seat, 
                         take a load off. Put the world in 
                         perspective.

               GENE lets HUEY usher him into a chair.

               The gun in his jacket pocket clunks against the arm of the 
               chair. A grim reminder. He pulls out the itinerary.

               ECU - ITINERARY

               12:45  -  Governor Eleanor Samara Grant  -  Pacific Rim 
               Multi-Cultural Conference  -  Pool Deck  -  Fourth Floor

               GENE looks at his watch.

               ECU WATCH

               12:32.

               The minute hand clicks to 12:33 as he watches.

               ANGLE ON HUEY - 12:33PM

               He works away at GENE's shoes.
 

                                     HUEY
                         So, are you a visitor or lucky enough 
                         to live in The City of Angels?

               It's more of HUEY's patter, no real substance to the inquiry.

                                     GENE
                         I'm...I'm visiting.

               GENE watches MR. SMITH frown and amble toward the shoeshine 
               stand.

                                     HUEY
                         What do you do, if I may be so bold?

                                     GENE
                              (looking at MR. SMITH)
                         I'm just an accountant.

                                     HUEY
                         Don't denigrate yourself, my friend. 
                         Where would the government be without 
                         accountants?  They wouldn't know how 
                         hard they can squeeze us before we 
                         pop, isn't that right?

               ANGLE ON MR. SMITH - 12:33PM

               He takes note of the conversation and wanders back to his 
               chair.

               ANGLE ON HUEY - 12:33PM

                                     HUEY
                         Now you take tips. Time was a tip 
                         was between a man and his customer. 
                         Not any more. They've figured out 
                         what they call a formulae, don't 
                         laugh, it ain't for babies. They 
                         take your sales, see, and slap a 
                         percentile on there, figuring that 
                         somewhere between your lies and your 
                         bad luck they'll hit on the mean 
                         amount, mean meaning "in the middle", 
                         but if you ask me it means "just 
                         plain mean". Why you can have Uncle 
                         Scrooge wring a nickel over your 
                         poor out-stretched palm, or Daddy 
                         Warbucks dropping pearl stick-pins 
                         like manna from heaven, don't make 
                         no difference, they'll tax your behind 
                         according to that same figure. Doesn't 
                         seem quite right., does it?
 

                                     GENE
                         No. No, it doesn't.

               The Bellboy GUSTINO walks by, calls out to HUEY.

                                     GUSTINO
                         Hey, Huey, how's it hangin'?

                                     HUEY
                         It's a load, my friend, but somebody's 
                         got to carry it.

               GUSTINO laughs, waves.

                                     GENE
                         I have to do something.

                                     HUEY
                         What's that? You have to speak up.
                              (taps his ear)
                         I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between 
                         that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. 
                         Compliments of the United States 
                         Army Artillery Corps.

                                     GENE
                         I said I have to do something.

                                     HUEY
                         I'll have you out of here in two 
                         shakes o'f a lamb's tail.

                                     GENE
                         Is within himself.

               GENE I keep wondering what she would do if she was here. 
               She'd figure it out. She'd run it down like a column of 
               numbers. Pro's and cons. That's the way she was: Lists all 
               over the house.

               HUEY's manic shoe-shining slows down: who has he got in his 
               chair?


                                     GENE
                         Drove me crazy. There must have been 
                         one on me. I didn't add up so she 
                         left. That's what attracted me to 
                         her In the first place. She made up 
                         her mind and she did it. She wouldn't 
                         sit around waiting for...whatever. 
                         She'd do something. She'd do 
                         something.

               HUEY keeps his eyes on his work. He's afraid he's got a live 
               one.

                                     HUEY
                         Yes, well, you know, for a quality 
                         shoe you can't beat a good wingtip. 
                         Wears like iron. You're a wise man. 
                         There ya' go. Two bucks.

               HUEY gestures for GENE to get down. GENE steps to the floor. 
               He pays HUEY with a twenty.

                                     HUEY
                         You got anything smaller?

                                     GENE
                         Keep it.

                                     HUEY
                         It's a twenty.

                                     GENE
                         Keep it.

               GENE is thinking about something.

                                     HUEY
                         Well...thanks muchly...

               GENE looks around the lobby, at MR. SMITH, the Flower Street 
               entrance, the rest of the area, feeling the gun in his pocket.

                                     GENE
                         Can I get out to Flower Street from 
                         here?

                                     HUEY
                         Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you 
                         right out there.


               HUEY nods toward the bar.

                                     GENE
                         Thanks.

               GENE walks toward the bar. HUEY shakes his head: time for 
               the boys in white.

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 12:35PM

               GENE looks towards the Flower Street entrance. The van is 
               still there. A bus pulls up.

               GENE walks past MR. SMITH.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You get another chance in ten minutes.

                                     GENE
                         Then I have time for a drink.

               He heads up to the bar.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         All right, Mr. Watson, but make it 
                         just one. I don't want you...

               But GENE is long gone.

               INT. HOTEL BAR AREA - DAY - 12:3 6PM

               GENE walks into the area of the bar. The BARTENDER is just 
               returning to chat with a customer, a REPORTER who is getting 
               sloshed. GENE moves slowly along the bar, into an area where 
               MR. SMITH'S view of him is blocked.

                                     REPORTER
                         So where was I?

                                     BARTENDER
                         I don't know. Something about the 
                         Governor's new regime.

               GENE hears this and glances towards them.

                                     REPORTER
                         Oh yeah. She's dumping the Good Old 
                         Boys like yesterday's newspapers.


               GENE sees that MR.SMITH can no longer see him. He scans the 
               lobby, sees a smaller door that leads onto Flower Street.

                                     REPORTER
                         The white boys are in for it. When 
                         they got her elected they never 
                         thought she was gonna make the 
                         Governor's office look like the United 
                         Nations.

               The BARTENDER laughs. GENE quickly cuts across the lobby and 
               out the smaller door onto Flower Street.

                                     REPORTER
                         We're talking Custer's Last Stand 
                         here. The only minorities not on her 
                         staff are the ones still lost in the 
                         Rain Forest.

               EXT. FLOWER STREET - DAY - 12:3 6PM

               GENE comes out the door, dashes across the street, weaving 
               through the traffic.

               Once across, he heads up the sidewalk toward the van, keeping 
               low, sneaking up behind it. He crouches by the front door, 
               one hand sliding into his pocket for the' gun, the other -on 
               the door handle. He raises his head cautiously and looks 
               inside the cab.

               No MS. JONES up front at least. He takes a breath, braces 
               himself. With one motion he jerks the back door open, yanks 
               out the gun.

               INT. VAN - DAY - 12:37PM

               The first thing he sees, fixates on, is LYNN. She is stretched 
               out on the seat, eyes closed, mouth open. She appears dead.

                                     GENE
                              (a gasp)
                         Lynn!

                                     MS. JONES (O.S.)
                         Shhh. You'll wake the baby up.

               MS. JONES is sitting on the seat behind the one LYNN is on. 
               GENE points the gun at her face. She smiles.


                                     MS. JONES
                              (softly)
                         What we have here is what they call 
                         a Mexican standoff. The thing you 
                         gotta ask yourself is, "What's behind 
                         the seat?"  Now, a twenty-two'd go 
                         right through it, but even a button 
                         will throw a twenty-two off so there's 
                         a good chance it'd get screwed up 
                         somewhere along the way, miss the 
                         target. Maybe a thirty-eight?  A 
                         thirty-eight'11 drill pretty straight,
                         unless it hits metal, then it'll 
                         bust up in little bitty pieces. 
                         They'll keep going but they'll be 
                         slowed down quite a bit. How's about 
                         a three-fifty-seven?  It'll go through 
                         the seat, her, you, the dashboard, 
                         shit, it'll go through the engine 
                         block before it knows it's hit 
                         anything, end up in some pedestrian 
                         three blocks away. What do you think? 
                         What's my poison?

               GENE look at Lynn's sleeping face - the gun in his own hand. 
               He lowers the gun, defeated.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Well it's a comfort to know you've 
                         got the co-Jones to pull that thing 
                         out. Whether you've got the balls to 
                         pull the trigger we've still got to 
                         see.

               EXT. FLOWER STREET - DAY

               GENE climbs out of the van, shuts the door, leans there. The 
               gall of his defeat is hard to swallow. He realizes he's 
               holding the gun, hurriedly tucks it away.

               INT. THE VAN - DAY - 12:38PM

               MS. JONES puts her gun down, raises a walkie-talkie.

                                     MS. JONES
                              (into the walkie-talkie)
                         He's coming back in.


                                     MR. SMITH
                              (filtered)
                         I've got him in the crosshairs.

               INT. BUFFET AREA - DAY - 12:38PM

               MR. SMITH near the entrance, eating some food. He watches

               GENE walk past him. Their eyes meet.

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 12:39PM

               GENE looks at his watch, then checks the itinerary once more.

               ECU - ITINERARY

               12:45 -  Governor Eleanor Samara Grant - Pacific Kim Multi-
               Cultural Conference - Pool Deck - Fourth Floor

               ANGLE ON GENE-NEAR BUFFET AREA - 12:39PM

               GENE addresses another Bellboy, HECTOR who is moving luggage 
               out to the street.

                                     GENE
                         Pool Deck?

                                     HECTOR
                         Fourth Floor. Take that escalator.

               GENE thanks him and moves across the lobby MR. SMITH follows 
               GENE

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - BAR AREA - DAY - 12:39PM

               GENE heads toward the escalators. Ahead of him, he sees 
               ELEANOR GRANT and BRENDAN GRANT surrounded by AIDES and 
               SECURITY MEN facing a crowd of PRESS PEOPLE. The Governor 
               and her husband have an arm around each other. They are 
               smiling, relaxed, quite the" happy couple. They give each 
               other a warm kiss. Camera flashes, recording the moment.

               GENE, heading toward them, has to thread his way through a 
               large WEDDING PARTY - tuxedos and bridesmaid gowns. When he 
               clears them he has neared the impromptu press conference.


               ANGLE ON BRENDAN GRANT - 12:3 9PM

               He is now alone in front of a campaign poster, fielding 
               questions from a few remaining REPORTERS.

               Farther on, ELEANOR GRANT and her entourage can be seen taking 
               the escalator up. GENE heads that way, passing BRENDAN GRANT.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         My wife is not interested in negative 
                         campaigning. She wants to accentuate 
                         the positive. I don't know about you 
                         but I find that refreshing.

                                     A REPORTER
                         Have you ever thought of running for 
                         office yourself?

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                              (smiles, charmingly)
                         Me?

               A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN walks by. The Governor's husband's eyes 
               follow her appreciatively as he says:

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         I'm just a business man.

               ANGLE ON GENE - 12:40PM

               He nears the escalator. It's crowded and GENE is pulled into 
               the midst of NEWS PEOPLE, TV, RADIO, PRESS. He joins the 
               flow and lets it pull him along.

               GENE rides the escalator to the Second Floor and follows the 
               crowd up two flights of the circular stairs.

               Down a short tunnel and out onto the Pool Deck.

               EXT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - POOL, DECK - HIGH ANGLE - 12:41PM

               About an acre of grass on the Fourth Floor. Skyways connect 
               the Pool Deck to the office buildings across Flower and 
               Figueroa. A platform has been set up with chairs and 
               microphones in front of a podium.


               EXT. POOL DECK - CLOSE ANGLE ON GENE - 12:41PM

               GENE blinks in the sudden, bright sunshine. When his eyes 
               adjust, he finds himself in a line that is approaching A 
               SECURITY MAN with a hand-held metal detector. He panics, 
               turns, trying to escape, but finds himself bumped along, 
               trapped. The line shuffles forward. He turns, determined to 
               make a supreme effort to escape and finds himself facing a 
               2ND SECURITY MAN, who waves him to one side.

               2ND SECURITY MAN Excuse me, sir, You don't have to wait. I 
               can take you over here.

               GENE is dragged forward. He looks around; no way out. He 
               stands, expectant, as the detector slides down one side of 
               his body, is lifted over to the other. Down it slides, toward 
               the pocket concealing the gun. GENE waits for the alarm -
               which doesn't come. The SECURITY MAN operating the gizmo 
               deftly switches it off as it passes the weapon. GENE is pushed 
               on, looking back, confused, alarmed, finds himself among:

               PRESS by the dozens. Eleanor Samara Grant SUPPORTERS by the 
               hundreds. SECURITY MEN and COPS IN UNIFORM. GENE moves through 
               them, trying to figure out what just happened. He glances 
               back to the 2ND SECURITY MAN, and bumps into one particular 
               POLICE OFFICER, plain clothes, badge in pocket, who reacts 
               with a quick laugh.

               POLICE OFFICER Easy, sir. Got to watch where you're going in 
               a crowd like this.

               He is a handsome, solid-looking guy. You'd trust him. Call 
               him OFFICER TRUST. OFFICER TRUST seems to be in charge. He 
               moves off through the crowd, giving LOCAL POLICE orders in 
               an easy way.

               GENE looks around. He can't see MR. SMITH. He edges his way 
               after OFFICER TRUST, who reaches the wall beyond which is 
               the drop to the street. He leans there comfortably, scanning 
               the crowd, GENE reaches the wall a few yards away from him. 
               He looks out at the city, getting his courage up. Just as he 
               turns to approach OFFICER TRUST:


                                     MR. SMITH (O.S.)
                         I know what you're thinking.

               GENE freezes! MR. SMITH appears from the crowd, joins him. 
               He smugly flips his walkie-talkie into the air, catches it.

                                     GENE
                         What would you do in my place?

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Me?

               He flips the walkie-talkie, catches it.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         The bitch would be dead. Course I 
                         ain't sayin' which bitch.

               He flips the walkie-talkie. GENE lashes out, smacks the walkie-
               talkie. It sails over the edge, falls and smashes onto the 
               sidewalk four stories below.

               MR. SMITH goes ballistic.

               GENE walks away from him - right up to OFFICER TRUST.

                                     GENE
                         There's a plot to kill the Governor. 
                         If you don't believe me, check that 
                         guy right there. He has a gun.

               OFFICER TRUST looks at MR. SMITH and then at GENE.

                                     OFFICER TRUST
                         So do you, Mr. Watson.

               And OFFICER TRUST reaches in his hip pocket for a spare Walkie-
               Talkie that he tosses to MR. SMITH.

                                     OFFICER TRUST
                         You got this under control?

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Yeah.

                                     OFFICER TRUST
                         It doesn't look like it.


                                     MR. SMITH
                         It's under control.

                                     OFFICER TRUST
                         It better be.

               OFFICER TRUST walks away.

               MR. SMITH stares at a devastated GENE. He sticks the walkie-
               talkie into his pocket, grabs GENE under the arm, drags him 
               to an isolated corner.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         I oughta throw you after that walkie-
                         talkie but I'm going to give you a 
                         break because you're an amateur.

                                     WAITER M (O.S.)
                         Gentlemen...

               The WAITER offers a tray of hors d'houvres.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Yeah, thanks. Have a cracker.

               GENE shakes his head.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Have a cracker, Mr. Watson.

               GENE woodenly takes one. The WAITER moves on.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         There was this guy. Big guy. Irish-
                         Italian. Red-faced, black-haired, 
                         jolly son-of-a-bitch.

               We see them from a distance - just a couple guys chatting.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Nobody could make me laugh like him. 
                         We closed more bars together than I 
                         can count. He was my pal. I loved 
                         that crazy mick, I'm not ashamed to 
                         say it. But he was fuck-up. He had 
                         this image of himself. Thought he 
                         was con man. Always trying to shave 
                         the edge. Nickel and dime. I'll always 
                         miss him. Tell me why.


                                     GENE
                         What...?

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Tell me why I miss him.

                                     GENE
                         He's dead?

                                     MR. SMITH
                         That's right. He's dead. Tell me 
                         why.

                                     GENE
                         How should I...?

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Tell me why he's dead.

               GENE stares at him for a beat.

                                     GENE
                         You killed him.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         That's right, I killed him. He fucked 
                         up one too many times so I put a 
                         bullet in his eye. Then I put two 
                         more into him just to make sure. Now 
                         that was somebody I loved.

               He moves in on GENE, crowding him. He breathes hard, looks 
               like one insane piece of work.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         I loved that motherfucker but I got 
                         the call and I put him down like a 
                         sick animal. So if you've got any 
                         doubts about what's going to happen 
                         if you don't deliver let me tell you 
                         something. I'd make gravy out of 
                         your little girl just to season that 
                         black Irish cocksucker's meat.

               A wave of applause catches their attention.


               ANGLE ON ELEANOR GRANT

               She and her entourage enter the Pool Deck and walk toward 
               the platform. ELEANOR GRANT gladhands people on the way.

               ANGLE ON MR. SMITH - 12:45PM

               He turns' back to GENE.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Do what you're supposed to do. Do it 
                         now.

               He grabs GENE and gives him a push. There is a general 
               movement in the crowd toward the platform. GENE is buffeted 
               along. MR. SMITH follows him, keeping him in sight, but then 
               a PACK OF PHOTOGRAPHERS move in, start snapping, lifting 
               their cameras high to shoot over the crowd. MR. SMITH 
               instinctively turns away, hiding his face. He moves around 
               the PHOTOGS and finds himself separated from GENE by the 
               mob. He searches, trying to spot him.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Shit!

               ANGLE ON GENE - 12:4 6PM

               In the crowd, GENE is bumped this way and that. His face 
               displays an inner devastation. His eyes focus desperately on 
               something ahead:

               It is the back of ELEANOR GRANT'S head. She is turning this 
               way and that, greeting supporters.

               GENE's hand slides into his pocket, grips the gun. He is at 
               the end of his rope. He is going to do it.

               ANGLE ON ROSTRUM

               A local POLITICO mounts the platform, taps the microphone.

               LOCAL POLITICO Can I have your attention Please! Please 
               welcome a man who was for 19 years the distinguished Mayor 
               of Los Angeles.  The honorable Tom Bradley.

               The CROWD reacts loudly, yells and whistles. GENE-pushes his 
               way forward.


                                     TOM BRADLEY
                         It is my extreme pleasure this 
                         afternoon to introduce to you...

               ANGLE ON GENE - 12:4 6PM

               He is now a few yards from ELEANOR GRANT. He comes up against 
               the SECURITY MAN who gave him the once-over with the metal 
               detector. The man's eyes slide over him, then he looks away. 
               He nonchalantly steps aside, moves off through the CROWD.

                                     TOM BRADLEY
                         ...a woman who can only be 
                         characterized as a one-of-a-kind.

               GENE is close to ELEANOR GRANT. She is just a few bodies 
               away, visible between them. His hand moves in his pocket. He 
               swallows. The impulse sweeps over him and...

                                     KRISTA (O.S.)
                         Feeling better?

               KRISTA BROOKS, the young woman from the elevator is next to 
               him, smiling. He looks at her in confusion.

                                     TOM BRADLEY
                         An iconoclast with class...

                                     KRISTA
                         The elevator. You weren't feeling 
                         well.

               GENE looks at ELEANOR GRANT.

                                     TOM BRADLEY
                         A genuine lady who's not afraid to 
                         get into the trenches...

                                     KRISTA
                         Are you better now?

               GENE turns, scans the crowd - no sign of MR. SMITH.

                                     TOM BRADLEY
                         ...and go to the mat with greedy 
                         special interests...

               GENE looks at KRISTA, studies her intensely. She's a bit 
               unnerved.


                                     TOM BRADLEY
                         The finest Governor our state has 
                         ever had...

               Again GENE looks at ELEANOR GRANT. She's turning around, 
               facing the crowd, facing him.

                                     TOM BRADLEY
                         My friend and yours, Governor Eleanor 
                         Grant!

               ELEANOR GRANT raises her arms. A perfect target. The CROWD 
               roars as GENE turns back to KRISTA. He leans into her, speaks.

                                     GENE
                         My wife always said I had a problem 
                         trusting people.

                                     KRISTA
                         Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara 
                         Grant.

                                     GENE
                         You don't understand. I'm going to 
                         trust you. And you have to trust me.

               Krista looks at Gene.

                                     KRISTA
                         Yes, you're right, I don't understand.

                                     GENE
                         Look...my daughter ... she's going 
                         to die...unless you can help me.

               Krista assesses Gene, his desperate tone of voice. Obviously 
               a nut case. A well-dressed nut case, but a nut case 
               nevertheless. Krista, nervous, looks around for help.

                                     KRISTA
                         Sure, sure, I'll help you. Let me 
                         get Mr. White. I'm sure he can assist 
                         you, he's our...

               Gene pulls the gun, holding it in Krista's sight only, 
               unnoticed by anyone else.


                                     GENE
                              (sotto voce)
                         No! You have to listen to me.

               Krista stares wide-eyed at the gun, at Gene.

                                     KRISTA
                         I'm listening, I'm listening.

               ANGLE ON THE ROSTRUM

               ELEANOR GRANT takes over the microphone from the beaming 
               LOCAL POLITICO.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         My friends, my good friends...

               ANGLE ON THE CROWD

               Gene and Krista are gone.

               EXT. BEHIND THE PLATFORM - DAY - 12:47PM

               Hidden by potted plants and campaign posters at the fringe 
               of the CROWD, GENE confronts KRISTA, covering her with the 
               pocketed gun. In the background, ELEANOR GRANT delivers a 
               ringing speech, accented with applause.

                                     GENE
                         Please...please...you have to believe 
                         me... They have my daughter.  They 
                         want me to kill Eleanor Grant  or 
                         they'll kill my daughter.

               KRISTA tries to edge away.

                                     KRISTA
                         All right, let's just...let's get 
                         security in on this.

                                     GENE
                         No! You can't! They're in on it.

                                     KRISTA
                         I don't see how they could be in on 
                         it. They're the best. They're hand-
                         picked.
 

                                     GENE
                         I don't know. One of them is following 
                         me. If he knew what I'd just told 
                         you they'd...

               GENE pulls the gun from his pocket. She recoils, thinking 
               he's going to shoot her.

                                     GENE
                         Look, how did I get in here with 
                         this!?

               KRISTA stares at the gun. She can't deny the fact.

                                     KRISTA
                         I don't know.

                                     GENE
                         You've got to trust me. I'm putting 
                         my daughter's life in your hands. 
                         She's only six. She's just a little 
                         girl. Please, please, trust me.

                                     KRISTA
                         It's a little hard to trust you under 
                         the circumstances.

               GENE looks at her intently.

                                     GENE
                         You're right, it is.
                              (beat)
                         Here.

               GENE offers KRISTA the gun. She is surprised, to say the 
               least. She takes it gingerly, with only the tips of her 
               fingers.

                                     GENE
                         Will you trust me now?

               She stares at the gun, at the strange man.

                                     KRISTA
                         I guess I'll have to. Come on, there's 
                         one person we can go to.
 

                                     GENE
                         The man following me has a walkie-
                         talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll 
                         call his partner. I do anything out 
                         of line and he'll send the word to 
                         kill my daughter.

                                     KRISTA
                         He'll think you're in the crowd until 
                         the end of the speech. Wait a minute.

               She steps closer to the platform/ listens. ELEANOR GRANT'S 
               voice is heard.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT (O.S.)
                         ...I remember that horrible night as 
                         if it were yesterday. A phone call 
                         pulling me out of sleep, the terrible 
                         news...

               KRISTA checks her watch.

               12:48.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT (O.S.)
                         My husband and child senselessly 
                         killed by a drunk driver.

                                     KRISTA
                         We've got about ten minutes.

                                     GENE
                         Are you sure?

                                     KRISTA
                         I've heard this speech a lot. Come 
                         on. We'll take care of him.  We will.

                                     GENE
                         But...

                                     KRISTA
                         Trust me. You asked me for help. Let 
                         me help. Trust me.

                                     GENE
                         Okay...

               She starts to lead him away.
 

                                     GENE
                         Hey.

               He stops her, points to the gun she still holds.

                                     GENE
                         I think you better put that away.

                                     KRISTA
                         I think you're right.

               She pulls out a handkerchief, covers the gun and tucks it 
               out of sight as she leads him behind the platform and away.

               EXT. POOL DECK - DAY - 12:4 9PM

               MR. SMITH still roams the crowd, looking for Gene.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         But tragedy, if it doesn't destroy 
                         us, has a curious way of giving us 
                         strength.

               He sees OFFICER TRUST who gives him a questioning look. He 
               ignores it.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         I doubt if I would be before you 
                         now, if I hadn't been put through 
                         that crucible of loss.

               MR SMITH notices the JAPANESE TOURIST COUPLE we met before. 
               The man has the video camera pointed at a sharp up angle.  
               MR. SMITH glances up toward what the man is shooting. 
               Consternation and anger fill his face.

               ANGLE ON RED BONAVENTURE TOWER - 12:4 9PM

               What he sees is one of the exterior elevators rising. KRISTA 
               stands at the glass looking down. Behind her, just glimpsed, 
               is GENE.

               ANGLE ON MR. SMITH

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         And though I can never forget William 
                         and Bill Junior or the love I felt 
                         for them...


               MR. SMITH cuts a wake through the CROWD.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         I have found joy again in serving 
                         this great state. I have found love 
                         again in my second husband Brendan...

               INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - DAY - 12:.50PM

               The elevator doors open. GENE and KRISTA bolt out and hurry 
               down the hall.

                                     GENE
                         Where are we going?

               INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - SECURITY TABLE - DAY - 12:50PM

               KRISTA leads GENE past the SECURITY GUARD stationed in the 
               hallway at a small table. GENE tries to keep his face turned 
               away. The GUARD glances up.

                                     HALL GUARD
                         Ms. Brooks ...

                                     KRISTA
                         Is he in?

                                     HALL GUARD
                         Yes, ma'am.

               They walk past him. He's a bit curious about GENE, but shrugs 
               it off.

               GENE and KRISTA reach a door and knock.

                                     GENE
                         Who is this? Are you sure we can 
                         trust him?

                                     KRISTA
                         I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her 
                         Campaign Manager.

               The door opens. BRENDAN GRANT is framed there.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         What is it? Is there a problem?
 

                                     KRISTA
                         We need to see you, Brendan.

               She grabs GENE and pushes inside.

               INT. ROOM 2503 - DAY - 12:51PM

               Upscale suite. BRENDAN GRANT'S coat is draped on a chair. 
               KRISTA moves past him, pulling GENE.

                                     GENE
                              (to KRISTA)
                         We have to hurry.

                                     KRISTA
                         I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone 
                         is trying to kill Eleanor.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         What? What are you talking about?

                                     KRISTA
                         We need people we can "trust. We 
                         only have a few moments...

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         This is...this is insane. How do you 
                         know this?

                                     GENE
                         I know it because I'm the one who's 
                         supposed to kill her.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         You are!?
                              (to KRISTA)
                         You brought this man here!? You 
                         brought this man to my room!?

                                     KRISTA
                         I had to. Her Security people may be 
                         involved...

               There is the sound of a toilet flushing in an adjacent 
               bathroom. The door opens and A MAN emerges drying his hands 
               on a hotel towel. He is late-middle-aged, white, mild-looking, 
               perhaps wearing glasses.
 

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         Is there a problem, Brendan?

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         There certainly is. This man says 
                         he's been hired to kill Eleanor.

                                     GENE
                         Not hired. They're blackmailing me.

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         Who is this "they"?

                                     GENE
                         I don't...I don't know. Please, Mr. 
                         Grant! They have my daughter. I'm 
                         not some lunatic. Your wife is in 
                         trouble.  Someone is trying to kill 
                         her. Someone is trying to make me 
                         kill her. Please, listen...

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         And on the strength of this story, 
                         you bring this man to Brendan's suite?  
                         Does that show good judgment, Ms. 
                         Brooks?  I'm just a friend of 
                         Brendan's, but it seems to me...

                                     KRISTA
                         He brought a gun onto the pool deck.

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                              (beat)
                         What?

                                     KRISTA
                         He got onto the pool deck with a 
                         gun. How did he get past her Security 
                         carrying a

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         I see. Where is this gun?

                                     KRISTA I
                         Have it.


                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         Well, is it real? Do we know anything 
                         about it?

                                     KRISTA
                         It looks real. I don't know anything 
                         about guns.

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         Could I see it?

               KRISTA gets out the gun, wrapped in the handkerchief, hands 
               it to him. It lays in the palm of his hand. He unwraps it 
               awkwardly, examines it.

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         My goodness. It certainly looks real.

               He looks beyond them, towards the entrance to the suite.

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         What's your opinion? You're the expert 
                         in these matters, supposedly.

               GENE turns, to see who he is talking to.

               ANGLE ON DOORWAY - 12:.53PM

               MR. SMITH stands by the open door. Before GENE can speak, 
               MR. SMITH moves. It is fluid and cohtroled and fast. He 
               marches across the room, detouring to grab a pillow from the 
               couch. He takes the gun, shoves" it- into the pillow and 
               goes face to face with KRISTA. She just has time to wonder 
               what is going on There is a double muffled gunshot. Shock 
               fills her eyes, she slides to the floor. GENE can only stand 
               there, unbelieving, freaked to the gills.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         Jesus Christ!

                                     MR. SMITH
                              (calmly, staring at 
                              GENE)
                         Yeah, I'd say it's real.

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         Are you out of your fucking mind!?


               The door opens. OFFICER TRUST slides in quickly.

                                     OFFICER TRUST
                         Somebody mind telling me...
                              (sees KRISTA's body))
                         What the hell happened!?

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Help me get her off the rug.

               OFFICER TRUST checks the hall, shuts the door. They begin to 
               drag her body to the bathroom. The MYSTERY MAN watches.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         What have you done to me!? Christ 
                         almighty!

               GENE's eyes follow them. As if rousing from a sleep he comes 
               to life.

                                     GENE
                         No!

               He tries to rush to the bathroom but MR. SMITH is right there, 
               gripping him. GENE struggles frantically, uselessly, watching 
               the bathroom door close. MR. SMITH is beyond anger. He grabs 
               GENE'S throat, muscles down. GENE grips the iron hand that's 
               cutting off his air.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You fucked up.

                                     MYSTERY MAN (O.S.)
                         That's enough.

               The MYSTERY MAN grabs MR. SMITH'S arm, tries to pry him loose. 
               MR. SMITH is beyond reason.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You want me to kill your kid!? You 
                         want me to kill you!?

               GENE's eyes begin to roll back in his head. Everything begins 
               fading to black.

               The blackness retreats in a rush and GENE finds himself 
               staring at the butt of MR. SMITH'S gun, visible under his 
               coat. He reaches for it, yanks it out, fires point-blank 
               into
 

               MR. SMITH, again, again. MR. SMITH'S shocked face falls away. 
               GENE heads for the door.

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         Don't let him go!

               OFFICER TRUST steps between GENE and the door. GENE shoots 
               him down and is out the door.

               INT. HALLWAY - DAY

               GENE stumbles out in the hall, gun in hand. He hurries down 
               the hall, looking back to see the MYSTERY MAN and a wounded 
               OFFICER TRUST spill out of Room 2503. The HALL OFFICER pulls 
               his weapon MYSTERY MAN Get him!

               GENE fires at the HALL OFFICER who goes down. GENE rushes 
               down the hall. One of the guest room door's opens and a MAN 
               staggers out. It is a bloody, wounded MR. SMITH! GENE stops 
               in shock.

                                     GENE
                         I killed you.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You fucked up.

               And MR. SMITH grabs him by the collar and throws him over a 
               railing.

               INT. THE LOBBY - MID-AIR - DAY

               GENE is falling, falling. He passes the ascending elevator 
               and gets a glimpse of MS. JONES and LYNN, pressed against 
               the glass, her face a mask of terror. The floor rushes up to 
               meet GENE and...

               INT. ROOM 2503 - DAY - 12:5 6PM

               ...he hits the floor, thrown there by MR. SMITH. His escape 
               has been a dream. A wrist-watch fills the frame.

               12:56.


               It is GENE's. We are seeing his P.O.V. He's laying on the 
               floor, his watch-hand in front of his face.

                                     MYSTERY MAN (O.S.)
                         You nearly killed him, too, you idiot!

                                     MR. SMITH (O.S.)
                         Nearly doesn't count.

               Lose the P.O.V.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         I'm on record. I never wanted this. 
                         I wanted simplicity; a telescopic 
                         sight, a powerful rifle, but no. 
                         What was good enough for Oswald wasn't 
                         good enough for you two. You had to 
                         get fancy. Drag some shmuck in off 
                         the street, stick a gun in his hand.

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         It's academic now. She had to be 
                         killed.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         What were you going to do, Brendan? 
                         Lock her in a closet?  You're in the 
                         fucking kitchen now. Get used to the 
                         heat. He's been seen all over the 
                         hotel, looking like some Loony Tunes. 
                         We even got him on video. It'll work. 
                         Don't worry about it.

               GENE stirs on the floor.

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         (about GENE) Is he awake?

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Yeah.

               He yanks GENE to his feet.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         Oh Great. Why don't we just give him 
                         our home phone numbers while we're 
                         at it?


                                     MR. SMITH
                         It doesn't matter what he hears.

               He pulls GENE over to the bathroom door. Throws it open. 
               GENE reacts to what he sees within.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         That's what it looks like. She was 
                         alive a minute ago. Now she's dead. 
                         Because you wouldn't do what I told 
                         you to do.

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         Get going. You've only got a few 
                         minutes to pull it together.

               MR. SMITH takes GENE out of the suite into the hall.  The 
               door closes. Brendan, the Mystery Man and Officer Trust are 
               alone BRENDAN GRANT I don't know if we should go through 
               with this.

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         It's too late for that.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         There is a dead woman on my bathroom 
                         floor!

                                     MYSTERY MAM
                         What about it? She's Eleanor's 
                         assistant and they will have been 
                         shot with the same gun, by the same 
                         lunatic.  Some, anonymous loser who 
                         went over the edge.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                              (breathing easier)
                         Only thing better would be if he 
                         were a postal worker.

                                     OFFICER TRUST
                         He won't be doing any work once I 
                         get through with him.

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         And in a few months you're in the 
                         Governor's mansion. The people'd 
                         make you king of California if they 
                         could.
 

               BRENDAN GRANT laughs.

               INT. HALLWAY - DAY - 12:57PM

               OFFICER TRUST exits from the room and engages the HALL OFFICER 
               in conversation down the hall. GENE and MR. SMITH turns the 
               other way, walk. In an undertone:

                                     GENE
                         I'm not stupid.. I know how this is 
                         supposed, to work.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Do you now, Mr. Watson?

                                     GENE
                         I kill her - and you kill me.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Keep your voice down.

                                     GENE
                         Even if you don't, Her Security men 
                         will.

               INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - ELEVATOR FOYER - DAY - 12:58PM

               They reach the elevator. MR. SMITH punches the button. GENE 
               turns on him.

                                     GENE
                         How am I supposed to get away?

                                     MR. SMITH
                         That's not my problem, Mr. Watson

               He gets out the walkie-talkie, keys it.

                                     MR. SMITH
                              (into the walkie-talkie)
                         Come back.

                                     GENE
                         How do I know you won't kill my 
                         daughter once I'm gone?


                                     MR. SMITH
                              (into the walkie-talkie)
                         Come Back....Fucking Radio.

               MR. SMITH is getting nothing but static. He angrily keys 
               off, hisses at GENE:

                                     MR.SMITH
                         I told you she'd be alright, if you 
                         do your job.

                                     GENE
                         And I'm supposed to trust you?

                                     MR. SMITH
                         What choice do you have?

               The elevator doors open. MR. SMITH gestures graciously.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         After you.

               INT. "BLUE" ELEVATOR - DAY - 12:58PM

               They step into the elevator. Stare at each other. The doors 
               close. MR. SMITH erupts. He grabs GENE slams him into the 
               outside window. GENE's face is smashed into the glass by MR. 
               SMITH'S shoulder. His body presses GENE against the glass 
               wall and he speaks, his mouth an inch from GENE's ear.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Look out there! You see the van?

               The van can be seen below on Flower Street.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You see it?!

               WHAM! He slams GENE's head against the window. He lifts up 
               the walkie-talkie.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Come back.


                                     MS. JONES (V.O.)
                              (filtered)
                         Yeah.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Do it!

               He jabs the walkie-talkie next to GENE's ear.

                                     LYNN (V.O.)
                              (filtered)
                         Daddy...?

               And then a scream. The horrible sound of a little girl in 
               terrible pain. It cuts through GENE like a stab in the heart.

                                     GENE
                         Lynn!

               He struggles to turn around. MR. SMITH kidney punches him, 
               hard! GENE goes down on one knee.

               The car stops. SOMEONE starts to board it, stops in surprise. 
               MR. SMITH sticks a badge in their face.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Security. Take the next car.

               They back off. The doors close, the car continues its descent.

               MR. SMITH lifts the walkie-talkie.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Again.

                                     GENE
                              (a gasp)
                         No, please...

               Another bone-chilling scream from the walkie-talkie. GENE is 
               ripped to his soul. MR. SMITH hauls him to his feet, shoves 
               him against the glass.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You got one last chance. Half an 
                         hour and that kid is dead. I'll kill 
                         her myself. I'll rip her fucking 
                         head off right in front of you!


               MR. SMITH releases GENE, who goes limp. The elevator doors 
               open onto the lobby.

               MR. SMITH gets out, straightening his tie, wiping the sweat 
               from his face.

               INT. THIRD FLOOR "GREEN" ELEVATOR LOBBY - DAY - 12:59PM

               GENE gets out of the elevator, almost getting caught in the 
               closing doors. He can't even fight back at the doors. They 
               pound him a couple of times before he is able to step clear 
               of the elevator. GENE stifles a retch, hurries away.

               MR. SMITH is standing there. Childish giggles erupt from the 
               walkie-talkie.

                                     LYNN (O.S.)
                              (filtered, giggling)
                         Daddy, did you hear me scream?

               INT. THE VAN - DAY - 1:00PM

               MS. JONES holds the walkie-talkie for LYNN.

                                     LYNN (O.S.)
                         She told me to scream as loud as I 
                         could. Did you hear me?

               OMIT

               INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:01PM

               GENE staggers over to the row of sinks. Leaning on one sink 
               with both hands, his body shudders violently. And he throws 
               up.

               A man exits a toilet stall and walks toward the sinks. He 
               sees GENE retching, turns away in disgust, and leaves quickly.

               GENE turns on the faucets.to wash the mess away.

               He tries to clean up, but catches his reflection in the 
               mirror. He has trouble looking himself in the eye.
 

               INT. THIRD FLOOR LOBBY - DAY - 1:01PM

               MR. SMITH is fuming. Into the walkie-talkie:

                                     MR. SMITH
                         The next time I tell you to do 
                         something, you goddamn well do it!

               INT. THE VAN - DAY - 1:01PM

               MS. JONES tries to be private on the walkie-talkie.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Hey, fuck you! You want to baby-sit 
                         a screaming kid in traffic, come out 
                         here and do it yourself. He got the 
                         message, didn't he?

               LYNN watches her, knowing something's not quite right.

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - EXT MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:02PM

               GENE comes out of the Men's Room, stands there at a loss.

                                     HUEY (O.S.)
                         Having a rough day? Down at the heels 
                         as they say? What you need is a shoe 
                         shine, shoe shine, shoe shine today.

               GENE looks around. HUEY has his nose in his magazine, calling 
               out his patter for whoever drifts by.

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOESHINE STAND - DAY - 1:02PM

               GENE walks over, climbs into a chair.

                                     HUEY
                              (still not looking up)
                         Take ten, take a break, take a seat, 
                         take a load off. Put the world in 
                         perspective.

               GENE has settled into the chair. HUEY tosses the magazine 
               aside, swings into action...

                                     HUEY
                         So, are you a visitor or are you 
                         lucky enough to...
 

               ...and freezes, staring at the familiar pair of shoes.

                                     HUEY
                              (as he looks up)
                         You got a complaint?

               GENE looks down at him.

                                     GENE
                         You remember me?

                                     HUEY
                         I remember. The big tipper.

                                     GENE
                         Something is going to happen. When 
                         it's over you'll know what I was 
                         talking about.

                                     HUEY
                         Oh, man...

                                     GENE
                         Please. Something is going to 
                         happen...

                                     HUEY
                         What? The end of the world? Man, 
                         don't give me your mad rap. I'm not 
                         a bartender. I don't want to hear 
                         it. I raise a family doing this 
                         bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your 
                         crazy white ass out of my chair.

                                     GENE
                         Please...

                                     HUEY
                         Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the 
                         right to crap in my ear. You want 
                         change?  You got it, brother. What 
                         was that you gave me, a twenty?

               HUEY kneels down, gets his cashbox, starts to open it up. 
               From behind him:

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Come on, let's get some privacy.


                                     GENE
                         He's deaf.

               It spills out of GENE almost without volition. There's a 
               note of pleading hidden in it. GENE slowly points a thumb at 
               HUEY's "Disabled Veteran" sign.

                                     GENE
                         He can't hear a word we're saying.

               MR. SMITH looks at the sign. HUEY stops what he's doing -
               "What the fuck?" He almost says it aloud, then:

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You wouldn't be kidding me now, would 
                         you, Mr. Watson?
                              (to HUEY's back)
                         Hey, nigger! Is that right? You can't 
                         hear me? Nigger?

               HUEY's face settles into something cold. What's he going to 
               do?  He stands, looks at GENE, who stares back at him, then 
               slowly turns around, looks at MR. SMITH - and breaks into a 
               jive-ass grin.

                                     HUEY
                         Why, looky-here. My customer-quotient 
                         just got multiplied by two. What do 
                         you think of that?  You'll have to 
                         forgive me, sir. Didn't hear your 
                         approach. Fact of the matter is, I'm 
                         deef as a post. Compliments of the 
                         United States Army...
                              (does a snappy salute)
                         ...Artillery Corps. Can I give you a 
                         shine, sir? You don't see your face, 
                         you don't pay.

               MR. SMITH is suspicious but he climbs into the second chair.

                                     MR. SMITH
                              (loudly)
                         Yeah, sure, give me a shine...
                              (looks at GENE)
                         ...shine.

               HUEY goes to work on his shoes.
 

                                     MR. SMITH
                         I'm putting your toy back in your 
                         pocket, Mr. Watson.

               Unseen by MR. SMITH, HUEY takes a peek and sees the gun being 
               transferred to GENE's pocket.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         It's all wound up. Now let's get out 
                         your itinerary.

               GENE does.

               "1:'30 - California Leads the Nation into the 21st Century -
               California Ballroom - Governor Eleanor Samara Grant and 
               Brendan Grant" It is the last entry.

                                     GENE
                         One thirty. California Ballroom.

                                     MR. SMITH
                              (glances at HUEY)
                         That's right. That gives you...

               He looks at his watch.

               1:04.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         ...twenty-six minutes to get your 
                         shit together.

                                     GENE
                         Let me talk to her again.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         No. 

                                     GENE
                         I want'to talk to her.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Forget about it.


                                     GENE
                         I talk to her or you can forget about 
                         it.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Don't you threaten me.

                                     GENE
                         What are you going to do about it, 
                         shoot me?

                                     MR. SMITH
                         (glances again at HUEY) You know 
                         what I'm gonna do.

                                     GENE
                         What? Walk out there and twist her 
                         arm off?

               MR. SMITH doesn't reply.

                                     GENE
                         It would be a lot less trouble just 
                         to let me talk to her.

               They stare at each other for a few beats. Then MR. SMITH 
               checks HUEY out and gets out the walkie-talkie.

                                     MR. SMITH
                              (into it)
                         Come Back.

                                     MS. JONES (O.S.)
                              (filtered)
                         Yeah.

                                     MR. SMITH

                         What gives? 

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Just put her on.

                         Daddy?

               GENE grabs the walkie-talkie.

                                     GENE
                         Yes, sweetie, it's me.

                                     GENE
                         I know you do, honey.

               INT. THE VAN - DAY -1:05PM

               MS. JONES holds the walkie-talkie for LYNN.

                                     LYNN
                         Can we go now?

                                     GENE (O.S.)

                         Not just yet, baby. There's...there's 
                         something Daddy has to do.

                         To be a hero?

               INT. BONAVENTURE LOBBY - DAY - 1:05PM

               MR. SMITH, GENE and HUEY in situ.

                                     GENE
                         No, honey, not to be a hero. But I 
                         want you to remember something for 
                         me, all right?

                                     LYNN (O.S.)
                              (filtered)
                         All right.

                                     GENE
                         He's doing it for you. No matter 
                         what anybody tells you, no matter 
                         who they are, he's doing it for you, 
                         because he loves you.


                                     MR. SMITH
                         That's enough.

               He reaches for the walkie-talkie, but GENE stares him down. 
               Back to the walkie-talkie:

                                     GENE
                         Will you promise me that?

                                     LYNN (O.S.)

                         I promise.

                                     GENE
                         All right. Kisses to you.

                         No, kisses to...

               MR. SMITH grabs the walkie-talkie.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         I don't care who the fuck you do it 
                         for just so you do it. Hey.

               He reaches down, snaps his fingers in HUEY's face. HUEY looks 
               up.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You done yet?

                                     HUEY
                         Just about.

               He gives the shoes a final wipe, stands away.

                                     HUEY
                         Two dollars, if it pleases you.


                                     MR. SMITH
                         It doesn't. I remember when it was a 
                         fuckin' quarter.

               He throws a couple dollars to HUEY. To GENE as he stalks 
               away:

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Twenty-five minutes.

               TO HIS BACK:

                                     HUEY
                         Thanks for the tip.

               HUEY turns back to GENE. They stare at each other.

                                     HUEY
                         Mister, what are you dragging me 
                         into?

                                     GENE
                         I'm not dragging you into anything. 
                         I don't expect...

                                     HUEY
                         Cover your mouth.

                                     GENE
                         What?

                                     HUEY
                         This gorilla's watching you, is that 
                         right?

                                     GENE
                         That's right.

                                     HUEY
                         Then don't let him be seeing you 
                         talking to me. I don't want him 
                         twisting my arm off.

               GENE lowers his head, covers his mouth with a hand. HUEY 
               pretends to work on his shoes.

                                     HUEY
                         That was your kid on the walkie-
                         talkie?
 

                                     GENE
                         My daughter. They have her in a van 
                         across the street. They say they'll 
                         kill her if I don't do something for 
                         them.

                                     GENE
                         There was a woman. She was trying to 
                         help me. I watched him murder her.

                                     HUEY
                         What are you supposed to do?

                                     GENE
                         Kill the Governor.

               HUEY checks his perimeters, then:

                                     HUEY
                         I knew I should have packed up and 
                         gone home as soon as I got that 
                         twenty. What am I supposed to do 
                         about this situation?

                                     GENE
                         One of them is in on it. He might 
                         even be in charge. Her Security is 
                         in on it. There's only one person I 
                         know for sure isn't in on it.

                                     HUEY
                         Who?

                                     GENE
                         The Governor. If I could just talk 
                         to her...

                                     HUEY
                         Oh, Jesus ...

                                     GENE
                         No way, there's nothing you can do 
                         to help me.


                                     HUEY
                         Then why'd you drag me into it?

                                     GENE
                              (getting emotional)
                         It's my kid. I've got to...to 
                         somehow...do right by my little girl.

               He gets out her picture, stares at it.

                                     GENE
                         It's about time I did. I was one of 
                         those guys, workaholics. I worked my 
                         ass off for them - my wife, my 
                         daughter.  That's just what I thought 
                         I was supposed to do.

                                     HUEY
                         Yeah, all right, listen...

                                     GENE
                              (running on)
                         So when she wanted a divorce...I 
                         was...I didn't know what I'd done 
                         wrong. I didn't see it. I didn't see 
                         it....

               HUEY takes his wooden brush and whacks GENE on the foot, 
               snapping him from his downward spiral.

                                     HUEY
                         Why don't you tell me about the early 
                         years some other time?

                                     GENE
                         I'm sorry. You understand I don't 
                         mind dying if I could save my 
                         daughter. I mean that.

                                     HUEY
                         Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with 
                         these shoes any more or it's gonna 
                         look funny. You go down get yourself 
                         something to drink. Make sure Godzilla 
                         there, follows you.

                                     GENE
                         What are you going to do?


                                     HUEY
                         I haven't the faintest idea. Go on 
                         now. I'll get word to you.

               GENE gets down.

                                     GENE
                         If nothing else, someone heard my 
                         story.

               He gives HUEY a twenty.

                                     GENE
                         Keep the change.

                                     HUEY
                         Don't think I won't.

               GENE just stands there. HUEY has to give him a little push.

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR - DAY - 1:09PM

               GENE turns and walks across the lobby toward the bar. His 
               mind is racing. As he passes MR. SMITH...

                                     GENE
                         I need a drink.

               MR. SMITH rises immediately, looks back at HUEY. HUEY gives 
               him a symbolic tip of the hat. MR. SMITH follows GENE.

               INT. HOTEL BAR - DAY - 1:11PM

               GENE finds a stool at the empty part of the bar. The place 
               is half-full, noisy. The television is showing a game show.

               The BARTENDER comes over.

                                     GAME SHOW HOST (O.S.)
                              (over television)
                         ...and time is running out...

                                     GENE
                         Give me a ...a gingerale?

               MR. SMITH sits -at the other end of the bar. The BARTENDER 
               gets him a beer. GENE and MR. SMITH lock eyes in the mirror.  
               Between them, a couple of T.V. NEWS TECHNICIANS are grabbing 
               a quick beer. A video camera resides on the bar by them.


               GENE notices OFFICER TRUST, walking by on a level above, 
               watching him.

                                     T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN 1
                         Man, I thought she was going to get 
                         out the violins.

                                     TV REPORTER
                         No shit. If I hear that stop the 
                         violence routine one more time I'm 
                         going to shoot somebody.

               A WAITRESS appears suddenly at GENE's elbow, surprising him. 
               She puts a basket of pretzels next to him and a coaster next 
               to his drink.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Here's your Ginger Ale, sir.

                                     DOWN THE BAR:
                         T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN 1 Politicians.

                                     TV REPORTER
                         They're all the same.

               The WAITRESS is tapping a long fingernail against the bar.

               GENE looks down and sees it. A note on the coaster. "Men's 
               Room - Huey."

               The WAITRESS turns the coaster over, and leaves. GENE looks 
               down the bar at MR. SMITH, drinking, unaware.

                         You know what bothers me?

               GENE looks at his watch.

               1:12.

                                     TV REPORTER
                         When they get all weepy eyed about 
                         the "ordinary citizen", the "regular 
                         Joe", the "normal American". Gimme a

               GENE stands.

                                     GENE
                         Well, I'm just a regular guy.

               The T.V. NEWS TECHNICIANS stare at him.

                                     TV REPORTER
                         Is that right?

                                     GENE
                         Yeah, that's right. But I've built a 
                         good solid business out of nothing. 
                         Don't underestimate the regular guy.

               He heads for the open lobby.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Sir, you haven't paid.

                                     GENE
                         It's on the Special Interest at the 
                         end of the bar.

               GENE jerks a thumb at MR. SMITH and is gone. MR. SMITH starts 
               to follow him. The BARTENDER is right with him.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Hey, Sir, don't make me call a cop.

               MR. SMITH slaps some money on the bar and leaves.

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 1:13PM

               MR. SMITH scans the lobby trying to spot Gene. OFFICER TRUST 
               comes up behind him.

                                     OFFICER TRUST
                         Where is he? Did you lose him?

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Shut up.
 

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOP ARCADE - DAY - 1:13PM

               Elsewhere, GENE circles around the lobby. There seem to be 
               clocks everywhere.

               A. set of four clocks over the registration desk with the 
               time for Tokyo, Los Angeles, New York, and Paris.

               The souvenir shop has a dozen clocks on display, with the 
               logos of various LA sports teams.

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - RESTAURANT AREA - DAY - 1:14PM

               The restaurant, the travel agency, the newsstand, all have 
               clocks.

               1:14 .

               Everywhere he turns. GENE has to look at his watch.

               1:15! GENE's watch and all the clocks tick over at once. 
               GENE winces as if he could hear all those minute hands tick 
               over one number in a thunderous chorus.

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOESHINE STAND - DAY - 1:16PM

               He's near the Men's Room. HUEY's stand has a sign on the 
               chair - "Gone to Lunch" and there is a clock face with 
               moveable hands. "We'll be back at 1:30."

                                     GENE
                              (sotto voice)
                         Let's all hope so.

               And he enters the Men's Room.

               Across the lobby MR. SMITH spots him, heads that way.

               INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:16PM

               GENE enters to find HUEY and GUSTINO the Bellboy. HUEY runs 
               to the door, keeping a lookout.

                                     HUEY
                         Quick, off with the shoes and pants. 
                         Trade with Gustino. The big guy's 
                         coming.
 

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR - DAY - 1:16PM

               MR. SMITH marching towards the Men's Room.

               INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:16PM

               HUEY turns to see GENE and GUSTINO just looking at each other, 
               uncomfortable, to say the least.

                                     HUEY
                         C'mon, ladies. No time to be shy.

               GENE kicks off his shoes, shucks his pants. He trades his 
               pants and jacket with GUSTINO, who has done the same. 
               GUSTINO's pants are too big for GENE. His pants are too small 
               for GUSTINO.

               GUSTINO goes into a stall and closes the door.

               HUEY comes back from the door.

                                     HUEY
                         Gustino! Drop 'em!

               GUSTINO has taken a seat inside the stall, but with GENE's 
               pants still up. He drops them.

                                     HUEY
                         And cover up them socks. Man, who 
                         dresses you?

               HUEY leads GENE to another door. "Service Personnel Only". 
               He taps on it. It is opened by a Latino JANITOR. HUEY and 
               GENE slip through the door, shut it. The JANITOR begins 
               mopping the floor as MR. SMITH comes in.

               His eyes come to rest on the stall. All he sees are GENE's 
               shoes and GENE's pants crumpled around the ankles.

               MR. SMITH smirks and leaves.

               The Janitor raps on GUSTINO's stall with the mop.

                                     JANITOR
                         Fue.  (Gone.)
 

               INT. SERVICE HALL - DAY - 1:17PM

               HUEY and GENE move down a drab service corridor. Boxes stacked 
               on both sides, floor buffers at rest, shelves with cleaning 
               supplies. GENE notices for the first time that HUEY has a 
               pronounced limp.

               They come upon IRENE the Cleaning Woman. She joins them moving 
               down the corridor.

                                     HUEY
                         Meet Irene.

                                     GENE
                         Hi.

                                     HUEY
                         Irene is going to help.

                                     GENE
                         Thank you.

               IRENE takes GENE's hand and leads him along at a half-trot.

                                     GENE
                         Where am I going?

               INT. BONAVENTURE - SERVICE ELEVATOR FOYER - DAY - 1:17PM

               They come through a short corridor and onto the service 
               elevator.

                                     HUEY
                         You said there was only one person 
                         you knew wasn't in on this thing.

                                     GENE
                         Yeah.

                                     HUEY
                         You're going to go see her.

                                     GENE
                         What!?

               The elevator doors close.
 

               INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - DAT - 1:17PM

               IRENE punches the button for the twenty-fifth floor.

                                     HUEY
                         You sure she's asleep?

                                     IRENE
                         I took up extra pillows. She take a 
                         nap before her big speech.

                                     GENE
                         What am I supposed to say to her?

                                     HUEY
                         It'll come to you. See if you can 
                         stop this thing 'fore it gets started. 
                         Save us all considerable 
                         embarrassment.

               HUEY takes a pillow and a blanket from IRENE'S cart and puts 
               it into GENE's arms IRENE You don't have to save me. I got 
               nothin' to do with it. You ain't gettin' no key from me.

                                     HUEY
                              (shocked)
                         Irene...?

               The service elevator stops. IRENE pushes her cart out into 
               the hall signalling them to stay put for a second. She starts 
               moving out into the hall, the card key falls on the floor.

               INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - SECURITY TABLE - 1:17PM

               At the other end of the hall the HALL OFFICER turns when he 
               hears her approach.

               INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - DAY -

               GENE and HUEY hover in the door of the service elevator. 
               Gene reaches down and snags the card key at his feet.
 

               INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - SECURITY TABLE - 1:17PM

               The HALL OFFICER has to move his table aside so Irene can 
               pass with the cart. As he turns,

               INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - DAY

               HUEY pushes GENE across the hall to the door of the Governors 
               bedroom.

               The Service Elevator door closes.

               INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - SECURITY TABLE - 1:18PM     

               HALL OFFICER turns quickly at the noise.

               INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - DAY

               GENE holds totally still in the alcove outside her room.

               INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - SECURITY TABLE - 1:18PM

               HALL OFFICER looks suspiciously, and finally sits back down.

               INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - DAY

               GENE uses the key to let himself into

               INT. ROOM 2510 - 1:18PM

               Lit only by a bedside lamp. ELEANOR GRANT is laying on the 
               bed, dressed, towel across her eyes, bare feet elevated on a 
               pair of pillows. GENE edges over slowly to her. He stands 
               over her, not knowing how to begin.

                                     GENE
                              (softly)
                         Excuse me...

               ELEANOR GRANT lifts a hand, moves the towel from her eyes.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Who the hell are you?

               She sits upright, reaches for the phone! GENE moves, putting 
               his hand on top of hers on top of the phone.
 

                                     GENE
                         No, please.

               They stare at each other for a beat.

               She bolts for the door! Gene beats her to it! She backs up 
               to the bed.

               Eleanor Grant is a strong, tough woman, but she's not 
               fearless.

                                     GENE
                         Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt 
                         you.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         My security people are right next 
                         door.

                                     GENE
                         I appreciate that.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         One loud scream will bring them in 
                         here instantly. You won't get very 
                         far. Think it over.

                                     GENE
                         If I were here to hurt you I would 
                         have done it already.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         That's...a comfort to hear.

                                     GENE
                         I have a problem.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Ah.

                                     GENE
                         Only you can help me. I'm also sorry 
                         to say, my problem is your problem, 
                         Mrs. Grant.

               She studies him.
 

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         I remember you...in the elevator.

                                     GENE
                         That's right.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         You were very nervous.

                                     GENE
                         It was because I had this...in my 
                         pocket

               He slowly pulls out the gun. She takes it in.

                                     GENE
                         I need you to listen to me. Carefully. 
                         Three lives depend on you listening 
                         very carefully to what I have to 
                         say.

               She smiles.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                              (friendly as can be)
                         Of course. But suppose we set up an 
                         appointment. I have an important 
                         speech to deliver and you're cutting 
                         into my nap time.

               Very slowly, she moves to the table, lifts the phone ELEANOR 
               GRANT My assistant, Krista Brooks, takes care of 
               constituent...

                         Krista Brooks is dead.

               She freezes, slowly replaces the phone.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         How do you know that?

                                     GENE
                         I saw her die. She was shot. With 
                         this gun.

               She turns to him.
 

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         You shot her?

                                     GENE
                         No.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Who did?

                                     GENE
                         I don't know. The only thing I know 
                         about him is that he works for your 
                         husband.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         What?

                                     GENE
                         And your husband works for somebody 
                         else.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         What the hell are you saying?

               GENE glances at the bedside clock.

               1:19.

               He looks back to the Governor.

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR - DAY - 1:19PM

               An increasingly edgy MR. SMITH is looking at the Men's Room 
               door. He glances over to OFFICER TRUST who's keeping an eye 
               on him. He looks at his watch again, then gets up and heads 
               for the Men's Room.

               INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:19PM

               MR. SMITH enters. HECTOR is at the urinal.

               MR. SMITH checks out the feet under the stall. He has to 
               bend over to check properly. GENE''s shoes, GENE' s pants 
               legs.

               HECTOR notices MR. SMITH'S actions.

               MR. SMITH is aware that he's been noticed, but he is very 
               suspicious.
 

               HECTOR flushes the urinal.

               MR. SMITH stays by the stall. He is going to look over the 
               top of the stall. He rises on his tiptoes.

               But HECTOR is staring at him like he's a pervert.

               MR. SMITH is suddenly embarrassed. He backs away from the 
               stall.

               HECTOR washes his hands, watching MR. SMITH in the mirror.

               MR. SMITH leaves.

               HECTOR dries his hands. He walks over to the stall and knocks 
               on the door.

                                     HECTOR
                         He's gone.

               And GUSTINO tosses a Bellboy jacket over the top of the stall. 
               HECTOR puts it on.

                                     HECTOR
                         Hey, Gustino, what takes you so long? 
                         You need to eat more fiber.

                                     GUSTINO (O.S.)
                         You got anything to read?

               INT. ROOM 2510 - DAY - 1:21PM

               The clock on the nightstand.

               1:21.

               ELEANOR GRANT sits against the headboard. GENE sits on the 
               edge of the bed, the gun all but forgotten, held loosely in 
               his hand.

                                     GENE
                         I knew you wouldn't believe me.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         I said I'd listen to you, not 
                         necessarily believe you. You're 
                         telling me my people are in a plot 
                         against me. You're telling me my 
                         husband wants me killed. What do you 
                         expect?
 

                                     GENE
                         I don't blame you. I don't have any 
                         proof. But nothing like this occurs 
                         in a vacuum. You can't be totally 
                         oblivious. You must suspect something. 
                         You're doing things which are making 
                         people angry. People who have been 
                         in power a long time are losing their 
                         jobs. You know them better than me. 
                         How much does it mean to them?  How 
                         far would they go to hang onto it?

               Her eyes go inward, reflecting a vague doubt. GENE sees it, 
               hurries to follow up on this possible chink in her armor. 
               Excited by it, he gets up, forgets to cover her so closely.

                                     GENE
                         There's only one way to find out for 
                         sure. Try to cancel the last speech.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                              (smiling, covering 
                              her inner thought)
                         I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as 
                         my last speech.

                                     GENE
                         It's the last chance they have for 
                         me to kill you. Try to get out of 
                         it. They won't let you. They can't. 
                         Try to change the schedule and you'll 
                         know I'm right. What have you got to 
                         lose? It comes down to who you trust, 
                         them or me? Test them.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         I love it when pistolero's talk of 
                         trust.

               GENE, across the room looks at the gun in his hand. He takes 
               the plunge.

                                     GENE
                         This? I've never even fired one.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Indeed.

               ELEANOR GRANT'S hand sweeps the lamp off the table, plunging 
               the room into blackness.


                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                              (in the blackness)
                         Franco! Franco.'

               GENE slips out into the hall as the connecting room door 
               flies open. Light from the other room spills in. FRANCO rushes 
               in, pulling a gun.

               INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - SECURITY TABLE - DAY - 1:22PM

               The HALL OFFICER jumps from his chair and runs into the suite

               INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - DAY

               GENE quickly moves to the Service Elevator and pushes the 
               button.

               INT. ROOM 2510 - DAY - 1:23PM

               ELEANOR GRANT stares up at FRANCO, back-lit by the light 
               coming from the next room. It gleams off the gun he holds in 
               his hand. She stares from the gun up to his hulking frame.

                                     FRANCO
                         What is it, Governor!? What's wrong!?

               She hesitates.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         I...I'm afraid I've had a bad dream, 
                         Franco.

               INT. SERVICE CORRIDOR - DAY - 1:23PM

               The service elevator opens and GENE rushes out. He hurries 
               down the dim service corridor. Suddenly an arm snakes out of 
               the blackness and grabs him! HUEY steps into the light.

                                     HUEY
                         Well?

                                     GENE
                         I don't know.

                                     HUEY
                         What are you going to do now?


                                     GENE
                         I don't know. I have to get back.

               GENE keeps moving fast.  HUEY limps to keep up

                                     HUEY
                         What are you going to do!?

                                     GENE
                         This is about power and you haven't 
                         got any. There's nothing more you 
                         can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.

               HUEY watches him disappear.

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 1:23PM

               MR. SMITH sees the T.V. TECHNICIAN and REPORTER leaving the 
               bar with their equipment.

                                     OFFICER TRUST (O.S.)
                              (alarmed)
                         Where is he?

               MR. SMITH looks at the man who has appeared behind him.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         In the john.

               He looks at his watch.

               1:23.

                                     OFFICER TRUST
                         Get moving.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You' oughta learn to relax. I told 
                         you I've got it under control.

                                     OFFICER TRUST
                         It's time. It's time now.

               MR. SMITH scowls and heads for the Men's Room.
 

               INT. THE VAN - DAY - 1:24PM

               A different watch. The minute hand moves to:

               1:24.

               It is MS. JONES'. She is in the driver's seat. She looks 
               back at LYNN who is trying to amuse herself one way or 
               another. She checks her gun. She pulls out her walkie-talkie, 
               puts it on the seat beside her. She starts the car.

                                     LYNN
                         Where are we going?

                                     MS. JONES
                         Not very far, honey-pie. Not far at 
                         all.

               She pulls the van out into traffic.

               INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:24PM

               MR. SMITH bursts into the Men's Room. He goes to the stall 
               and lifts his fist to pound on the door.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Out of there, Mr. Watson! Your time's 
                         up!

               The stall door opens and GENE comes out, zipping up his pants. 
               He brushes right past MR. SMITH, heads for the door. MR. 
               SMITH reaches out, grabs him.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You forgot to wash your hands.

               He throws him against the sinks. GENE washes his hands. MR. 
               SMITH leans against the sink next to him In the mirror above 
               the sink, GENE sees the stall door swings open. GUSTINO Is 
               huddled in the corner, feet up on the toilet. MR. SMITH 
               doesn't notice.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         I've got faith in you, Mr. Watson. I 
                         know you're not just a regular guy, 
                         see, I know that. Even if you don't 
                         know it yourself. Maybe that's why I 
                         picked you.
 

               GENE steps between MR. SMITH and the open stall door.

                                     GENE
                         I know what I have to do. I'll do 
                         it. Let's go.

               And'they exit the Men's Room. GUSTINO slumps with relief.

               INT. ROOM 2510 - DAY - 1:25PM

               Other lights have been turned on. ELEANOR GRANT is fixing 
               her hair in the mirror. FRANCO is cleaning up the broken 
               lamp. There is a perfunctory knock on the hall door and it 
               opens, revealing BRENDAN GRANT. The MYSTERY MAN hovers in 
               the background.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         Hey, El, how's the head?

               She turns, locks eyes with the MYSTERY MAN.

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         Eleanor.

               She nods, turns back to the mirror.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm 
                         thinking of canceling the speech.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         It's an important speech.

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         I'd say critical, not that it's any 
                         of my business.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         It's just another speech in a Tower 
                         of Babel so high that Nimrod himself 
                         would be put to shame. Cancel. Make 
                         my apologies.

               In the mirror she takes note of BRENDAN GRANT and the MYSTERY 
               MAN exchange a look.
 

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         Excuse me.

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         I'll trot along. Nice to see you, 
                         Eleanor.

               BRENDAN steps into the room, shuts the door.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         During a campaign every speech is 
                         important. This is free media 
                         exposure. Primetime news coverage 
                         that we couldn't buy.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         What's he doing here?

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         Who, him? Just visiting.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT T
                         Hings have changed, Brendan. I thought 
                         you understood that.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         He's my friend. And he did help you 
                         to get elected, after all.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Don't remind me.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                              (re the broken lamp)
                         What happened here?

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Nothing. I broke a lamp.

               Brendan steps behind Eleanor and puts his arms around her 
               affectionately.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         Eleanor, please. I'll put it this 
                         way. This speech or a half-dozen 
                         rubber chicken-fund raisers. What do 
                         you say?


                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Truth is, besides the headache I've 
                         come down with a little lower 
                         intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll 
                         get you some Pepto, you'll make one 
                         of your patented tributes to the 
                         common person, then back to 
                         Sacramento. This is no time to lay 
                         down on the job. I don't care what 
                         the polls say, you can't afford to 
                         relax. Look what happened to Bush. 
                         Tell you what, if you want to blow 
                         off the Sacramento speech, fine. But 
                         do this one and we'll get out of the 
                         smog.

               ELEANOR GRANT looks at him, almost sadly. She steps toward 
               the dressing table to fix her hair

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         All right, I'll do it.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         That's my girl.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         But I want to make some changes. Get 
                         Krista in here right away won't you?

               BRENDAN looks at her for a beat, then snaps his fingers like 
               he just remembered something.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         You sent my assistant on an errand.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                              (trying to look 
                              sheepish)
                         I've been a bad boy.

               ANGLE ON ELEANOR

               It was not what she wanted to hear.


               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 1:26PM

               Mr. Smith pushes Gene toward the escalators.

               INT. CALIFORNIA BALLROOM - DAY - 1:27PM

               All sorts of MEDIA PEOPLE hover around, CAMPAIGN WORKERS 
               wearing political buttons and REGULAR FOLKS round out the 
               crowd. People are eating, drinking, and talking.

               There are a couple of bars, one at each end of the room. 
               Dessert tables are strategically placed around the room. On 
               the speaker's platform at one end is a podium with some chairs 
               arranged behind it.

               One of the POLITICO'S takes the podium microphone.

                                     POLITICO
                         Ladies, gentlemen, it is my great 
                         pleasure to introduce to you the 
                         esteemed spouse of our Governor. 
                         Let's give a big L.A. welcome to Mr. 
                         Brendan Grant.

               The crowd applauds warmly.

               INT. HALLWAY - DAY - 1:27PM

               GENE and MR. SMITH move down the hall, following the signs 
               to the California Ballroom. The entrance to it looms ahead.

               INT. CALIFORNIA BALLROOM - DAY - 1:27PM

               BRENDAN GRANT at the podium.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         Ladies and gentlemen of the press, 
                         campaign volunteers, and those of 
                         you who were looking for any excuse 
                         to take off work for the afternoon...

               Polite laughter.

               INT. HALLWAY - DAY - 1:27PM

               GENE is pushed up to the doorway where he is met by our 
               friend, the SECURITY MAN with the metal detector. He gives 
               MR. SMITH a nod over GENE's shoulder and sends GENE to join 
               the crowd beyond.


               INT. CALIFORNIA BALLROOM - DAY - 1:28PM

               VIEW THROUGH CAMERA

               The Video Camera clumsily tracks past the CROWD, and comes 
               tosettle on GENE who is walking into the room, not quite 
               sure where he is going.

               UP ON THE PODIUM:

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         We have with us today the first woman 
                         Governor of our great state...

               GENE is pushing forward into the crowd. He looks back, seems 
               surprised, begins turning, searching for someone as:

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         Governor Eleanor Samara Grant. What 
                         can I say about her....that won't 
                         get me in trouble when I get home 
                         tonight.

               Laughter.

               Lose the video camera effect.

               ANGLE ON GENE - 1:28PM

               GENE, in the midst of the crowd, can't locate MR. SMITH. 
               Confusion clouds his face.

               He finds himself near the T.V.TECHNICIAN from the bar. The        
               TECHNICIAN is talking into a walkie-talkie.

                                     T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN
                         Charlie. Charlie. Charlie, are you 
                         reading me?

               He gets nothing but static. GENE's eyes move to the back of 
               the room.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         She's a woman who loves our great 
                         state.

                                     T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN
                         Charlie...
                              (gives it up)
                         I can't get shit on this stupid radio.


               GENE looks up to a spotlight booth set up in the back.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         A brilliant legislator.

               GENE sees the GLINT of something. A gun? His eyes widen. Is 
               that MR SMITH there? He looks from the spotlight booth to 
               the stage.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         ...who will soon win her second term 
                         as the greatest Governor California 
                         has ever seen!

                                     T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN
                         Somebody's going to ave to run down 
                         to the truck. Tell them this radio's 
                         fucked.

               GENE looks away from the stage and locks eyes with OFFICER 
               TRUST. He's at the front of the ballroom to one side of the       
               speaker's platform.

               OFFICER TRUST stares at GENE like a hungry wolf, clutching 
               his gun in his pocket. They both hear:

                                     T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN
                         I can't get through. Walkie-Talkies 
                         don't work from here. There's too 
                         much concrete and stuff.

               Realization floods GENE'S eyes. He looks back at Mr. Smith 
               in he booth.

               ANGLE ON MR. SMITH - EXTREME CLOSEUP

               The camera pans along the barrel of the weapon until it comes     
               to Mr. Smith who is settling into firing position.

               ANGLE ON CROWD

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         Ladies and gentlemen...

                                     T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN
                         Nothin's getting out.

               OFFICER TRUST, presses forward, hand in pocket. Gene is his 
               target.


               ANGLE ON PODIUM - 1:29PM

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         I am honored to present to you our 
                         esteemed Governor and my beloved 
                         wife, Eleanor Samara Grant!

               ANGLE ON ELEANOR GRANT

               The crowd erupts in .applause and cheering as ELEANOR GRANT 
               comes from the rear of the auditorium and begins to work her 
               way down the center aisle. She waves and nods to all the 
               lyal supporters who surround her.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Thank you! Thank you all!

               Ballons are released above her onto the center of the floor.

               ANGLE ON WAITER-GUSTINO

               He is pushing a large high cart filled with hundreds of 
               finished plates back towards the kitchen area.

               ANGLE ON GENE - 1:30PM

               GENE looks at Mr. Smith and Officer Trust and the impending       
               disaster. He has to do something...anything...NOW!

               GENE begins frantically clawing his way toward the podium.

                                     GENE
                         Look out! Look out!

               But it is lost in the uproar.

               Fighting to be heard above the noise:

               GENE clawing forward, screaming hopelessly. He pulls the gun 
               out.

               ANGLE ON ELEANOR GRANT

               She spots Gene in the crowd, pushing toward her, gun drawn. 
               Her eyes widen in fear.


               BRENDAN GRANT follows her gaze. His eyes widen in something 
               other than fear.

               GENE aims his gun at the ceiling and fires.

               BAM! BAM!

                                     GENE
                         Look out!

               Pandemonium.  Total chaos. People scattering.

               The Gun in the booth swings from Gene to ELEANOR GRANT.

               Mr. Smith fires, but his target is blocked by a panicked 
               guest who is hit.

               From behind her, FRANCO runs to protect ELEANOR GRANT as 
               more gunfire erupts.

               Mr. Smith's aim is clear and he pulls...BAM!  BAM!

               FRANCO is hit in the center of the back and in the shoulder.  
               He falls onto ELEANOR GRANT and they both fall down hard on 
               the steps. Blood is everywhere.

               ANGLE ON GENE

               He looks over and sees ELEANOR GRANT, beneath FRANCO, looking 
               very dead.

               He careens toward a door.

               ANGLE ON PODIUM

               On the dais, BRENDAN GRANT crawls over to where FRANCO lays, 
               half on top of ELEANOR GRANT. They are both still, eyes 
               closed. BRENDAN looks down at his wife's face, splattered        
               with blood.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         My God, he did it!

               The Governor suddenly and violently gasps for breath.  Her 
               eyes snap open and burn into BRENDAN. She has heard her worst     
               suspicions confirmed.


               BRENDAN'S a great liar, but even he can't hide the shock and 
               fear on his face.

               INT. BACK HALLWAY - DAY

               GENE bursts through a door. He is followed speedily by OFFICER 
               TRUST.

                                     OFFICER TRUST
                         You little son of a bitch.

               His attack is interrupted by a noise from the darkness. The 
               HUGE DISH PLATE CART, fully loaded, comes flying toward them 
               pushed by GUSTINO. The cart smashes into OFFICER TRUST, 
               throwing him against a wall, dishes clatter and smash.

               GENE raises a hand to the darkness and takes off.

               INT. CALIFORNIA BALLROOM - DAY

               The dais. FRANCO takes a shuddering breath. ELEANOR GRANT 
               pulls herself free, leans over him. She rips opens his shirt 
               revealing a slightly-used bullet-proof vest with a bullet 
               hole that missed the vest and hit his upper arm. His eyes 
               flutter open.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Are you all right, Franco?

                                     FRANCO
                              (painfully)
                         I'd be better if they'd put sleeves 
                         on these damn vests.

               She touches his face, looks over to where her husband stands. 
               Their eyes lock. It's curtains for BRENDAN.

               EXT. HOTEL TAXI STAND - DAY

               The van pulls into a waiting area.

               INT. LOBBY - NEAR SHOESHINE STAND - DAY

               Huey turns and spots a van arriving outside the hotel. He 
               realizes who it could be.


               INT. THE LOBBY - DAY - 1:30PM

               GENE 'bangs out of a door, comes to a failing and sees:

               MR. SMITH has reached the spiral stairway. He starts down 
               it, two and three steps at a time.

               GENE moves along the railing.

               MR. SMITH is a whole floor below him. He looks up, sees GENE 
               and lifts the walkie-talkie to his mouth.

               GENE pockets the gun climbs the parapet. And jumps!

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 1:30PM

               GENE lands right on top of MR. SMITH. The walkie-talkie flies 
               over the railing and into the water of the central fountain.

               INT. THE VAN - DAY - 1:30PM

                                     MS. JONES
                              (on the walkie talkie)
                         It's time....You read me?  I don't 
                         hear from you I'm going ahead now.

               CHECKS HER WATCH:

               1:30

               INT. THE LOBBY - DAY - 1:31PM

               MR. SMITH and GENE roll down the steps, fighting. MR. SMITH 
               basically beats the crap out of him and gets up to continue 
               on. GENE somehow pulls himself up and tackles MR. SMITH. He 
               gets in a few lucky shots before MR. SMITH overpowers him, 
               beats him again finally .sending him flying into the fountain 
               pool.

               INT. THE VAN - DAY - 1:31PM

               MS JONES looks to the back seat at LYNN.

                                     LYNN
                         Why do you keep looking at me?


                                     MS. JONES
                         That's my job. I'm your babysitter.

               As they talk MS. JONES screws a silencer on her gun.

                                     LYNN
                         I'm not a baby.

                                     MS. JONES
                         You're a big girl, huh?

                                     LYNN
                         I'm not a big girl but I'm not a 
                         baby.

               MS JONES turns to face LYNN.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Close your eyes.

                                     LYNN
                         Why?

                                     MS. JONES
                         I've got something for you.

                                     LYNN
                         A surprise?

                                     MS. JONES
                         You ask too many questions. You want 
                         the surprise or not?

               LYNN closes her eyes. MS. JONES makes to do the deed.

               Suddenly, HUEY appears behind her at the windshield.

                                     HUEY
                         Good afternoon, madam. Hello there, 
                         little girl.

               With a crumpled up newspaper he begins vigorously rubbing 
               the window. LYNN's eyes pop open.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Hey, hey, what are you doing!?


                                     HUEY
                         Just giving you the gift of a clean 
                         windshield. Only cost you a dollar.

                                     MS. JONES
                         I don't want my windshield cleaned.

                                     HUEY
                         You just think you don't want your 
                         windshield cleaned.

                                     MS. JONES
                         No, I know I don't want it cleaned. 
                         Get out of here.

                                     HUEY
                         Don't be like that. Think of me as 
                         the Moses of dirty windshields leading 
                         you through the desert of dead bugs.

               LYNN laughs.

                                     MS. JONES
                         For the last time, I don't want it 
                         cleaned. Now get the hell out of 
                         here!

                                     HUEY
                         It's already done. I've already done 
                         it. You have to pay me now.

                                     MS. JONES
                         I don't have to pay you nothin'.

                                     HUEY
                         You're going to deny me a lousy dollar 
                         after I've sweated like a pig giving 
                         you the gift of a clean windsheild?

                                     MS. JONES
                         Fuckin' A.

                                     HUEY
                         I don't think so.

               He reaches in the passenger's window.


                                     MS. JONES
                         Hey!

                                     HUEY
                         I think this is worth a dollar.

               He snatches the walkie-talkie off the seat.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Goddamnit! Gimme that!

               She lunges across. HUEY dangles the walkie-talkie before 
               her.

                                     HUEY
                         Oh, we'll have to do better than 
                         that.

                                     MS. JONES
                         You worthless piece of shit! Gimme 
                         that!

               She throws open the passenger door, climbs out.

               EXT. TAXI STAND - DAY

               HUEY backs away, taunting her with the walkie-talkie. She is 
               caught between the van and HUEY, trying to keep her gun under 
               wraps.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Goddamnit, you fuckin' bum, come 
                         here!

                                     HUEY
                         Gimme a dollar.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Fuck you!

               She loses it, hauls out her cannon.

               BAM!

               HUEY's leg is shot out from under him. He ends up on his 
               back. MS. JONES swoops down on him, trying to grab the walkie-
               talkie..

                                     MS. JONES
                         Gimme that thing!


               HUEY's wounded leg is twisted under him.

               INT. THE VAN - DAY

               Lynn is terrified by the gunfire and looks for someplace to 
               go.

               EXT. THE VAN - DAY

               MS. Jones jumps on the wounded HUEY who is stunned but bravely 
               clutches the Walkie Talkie under him.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Goddammit, give it to me, you 
                         Sunnavabitch!

               She sticks the gun in HUEY's face. He tries to take it away 
               from her, but she's really tough...and mad.  The gun fires 
               wildly, hitting a passing vehicle which careens left causing 
               a chain reaction of COLLISIONS on the street.

               INT. THE VAN - DAY

               LYNN tries to open the van door to escape. The van's door 
               flies open. MR. SMITH stands there, gun in hand.-

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Daddy blew it.

               He points the gun. Lynn jumps back in terror and clambers 
               back in the van.  She goes over the seat as he FIRES...

               The back window SHATTERS.

               MR SMITH steps inside the van a step and aims over the seat. 
               This time he won't miss.

               LYNN has nowhere to hide.

               BAM! BAM!

               But it isn't his gun firing. He stands, staring surprised, 
               wide-eyed. He pivots...


               EXT. TAXI STAND - DAY

               ...and stares at GENE, soaking wet, holding the gun. MR. 
               SMITH'S gun slides from his hand.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Very good...Mr. Watson. I told 
                         them...I could make a killer out of 
                         you.

               He drops to his knees, pauses, then tree-falls onto his face.

               ANGLE ON GENE

               He rushes forward into the van and reaches over the seat to 
               pick Lynn up.

               ANGLE ON MS JONES AND HUEY

               She has heard the gunfire and turns her attention from HUEY 
               to GENE. She raises her gun and aims at GENE and LYNN inside 
               the van.

               HUEY reaches down, grabs his ankle and pulls his shattered 
               artificial leg out of the pants-leg and applies it to the 
               side of her head. She is knocked aside and out.

                                     HUEY
                         There's nothing like a good wing-
                         tip.

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOESHINE STAND - LATER - 2:26PM

               At HUEY's shoe-shine stand, GENE and HUEY sit in the shoe- 
               shining chairs. They are variously bandaged. LYNN is on GENE'S 
               lap. She clings to him, .her face buried against him.

               They are guarded by COPS.

                                     HUEY
                         What time is it?

               GENE looks at his wrist, gives an ironic smile.

                                     GENE
                         Lost my watch.

               A hub bub catches their attention.


               ANGLE ON LOBBY AREA-BELOW - 2:26PM

               A handcuffed BRENDAN GRANT is lead out by STATE POLICE. PRESS 
               flock around them - shouting questions.

               ELEANOR GRANT watches her husband taken out.

               The PRESS descends on her like ducks on bread crumbs. 
               Questions litter the air like confetti.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Any comment at this time would be 
                         most premature. Please, we'll have 
                         something for you in a couple of 
                         hours. Please...

               ELEANOR GRANT finally makes her way toward GENE. COPS keep 
               the PRESS back.

               INT. BONAVENTURE - SHOESHINE STAND - 2:27PM

               ELEANOR GRANT looks at GENE for a long moment.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         I...1 would like to...thank you, 
                         Mister Wat... Gene.

               GENE NODS, SMILES.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         I would also like to apologize.

                                     GENE
                         For what?

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         For not believing you.

                                     GENE
                         Believe me, I don't blame you.
                              (to LYNN)
                         This is the Governor, Lynn. Say hello.

               LYNN lets go of her father with one of her hands, gives a 
               shy little wave.

               The Governor reaches out, strokes the little girl's hair.


                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         You have a very brave father, Lynn.

               LYNN looks up.

                                     LYNN
                         He's a hero.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Yes, yes he is.

                                     LYNN
                         Dads are like that.

               She goes back to clinging to her father.  Gene looks like he 
               might cry he, loves her so much.

                                     GENE
                         Can we go now?

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Of course. I'll get a car to drive 
                         you.

                                     GENE
                         No, that's... That's OK. We don't 
                         need any help. We'll be just fine. 
                         Won't we, Lynn?

               LYNN nods. ELEANOR GRANT offers her hand to GENE.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Good luck.

                                     GENE
                         Same to you.

               ELEANOR GRANT walks away. The PRESS renews their assault.

               HUEY and GENE look at each other. Then:

                                     GENE
                         Thanks for the shine.

                                     HUEY
                         Thanks for the tip.


                                     GENE
                              (to LYNN)
                         Come on, kid. I gotta make a phone 
                         call.

               He gets up wearily, carrying his daughter, grabs his 
               briefcase, and heads away. LYNN peeks back over his shoulder 
               at HUEY, shyly waves. HUEY points at her.

                                     HUEY
                         Kisses to you.

               LYNN laughs, comes to life.

                                     LYNN
                         No, kisses to you!

                                     HUEY
                         No, kisses to you.

               INT. BONAVENTURE - LOBBY - DAY - 2:30PM

               Across the lobby, GENE's watch lays on the ground. The crystal 
               is smashed, the hands stopped.

               1:31.

               A shoe steps on the watch, crushing it further. It belongs 
               to the MYSTERY MAN. He stops, checks his perimeters and walks 
               slowly toward the exit.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END

  Title

  EXT. VARIOUS DAYS

  'She' plays through the credits.

  Exquisite footage of Anna Scott -- the great movie star of our
  time -- an ideal -- the perfect star and woman -- her life full of
  glamour and sophistication and mystery.

  EXT. STREET - DAY

  Mix through to William, 35, relaxed, pleasant, informal.  We
  follow him as he walks down Portobello Road, carrying a load of
  bread.  It is spring.

        WILLIAM (V.O.)
    Of course, I've seen her films and
    always thought she was, well,
    fabulous -- but, you know,
    million miles from the world I live
    in.  Which is here -- Notting Hill
    -- not a bad place to be...

  EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY

  It's a full fruit market day.

        WILLIAM (V.O.)
    There's the market on weekdays,
    selling every fruit and vegetable
    known to man...

  EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY

  A man in denims exits the tattoo studio.

        WILLIAM (V.O.)
    The tattoo parlour -- with a guy
    outside who got drunk and now can't
    remember why he chose 'I Love Ken'...

  EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY

        WILLIAM (V.O.)
    The racial hair-dressers where
    everyone comes out looking like the
    Cookie Monster, whether they like
    it or not...

  Sure enough, a girl exits with a huge threaded blue bouffant.

  EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - SATURDAY

        WILLIAM (V.O.)
    Then suddenly it's the weekend, and
    from break of day, hundreds of stalls
    appears out of nowhere, filling
    Portobello Road right up to Notting
    Hill Gate...

  A frantic crowded Portobello market.

        WILLIAM (V.O.)
    ... and thousands of people buy
    millions of antiques, some genuine...

  The camera finally settles on a stall selling beautiful stained
  glass windows of various sizes, some featuring biblical scenes
  and saints.

        WILLIAM (V.O.)
    ... and some not so genuine.

  EXT. GOLBORNE ROAD - DAY

        WILLIAM (V.O.)
    And what's great is that lots of
    friends have ended up in this part of
    London -- that's Tony, architect
    turned chef, who recently invested
    all the money he ever earned in a new
    restaurant...

  Shot of Tony proudly setting out a board outside his restaurant,
  the sign still being painted.  He receives and approves a huge
  fresh salmon.

  EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY

        WILLIAM (V.O.)
    So this is where I spend my days
    and years -- in this small village in
    the middle of a city -- in a house
    with a blue door that my wife and I
    bought together... before she left
    me for a man who looked like Harrison
    Ford, only even handsomer...

  We arrive outside his blue-doored house just off Portobello.

        WILLIAM (V.O.)
    ... and where I now lead a strange
    half-life with a lodger called...

  INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - DAY

        WILLIAM
    Spike!

  The house has far too many things in it.  Definitely two-
  bachelor flat.

  Spike appears.  An unusual looking fellow.  He has unusual
  hair, unusual facial hair and an unusual Welsh accent: very
  white, as though his flesh has never seen the sun.  He wears
  only shorts.

        SPIKE
    Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me
    with an incredibly important
    decision, could you?

        WILLIAM
    This is important in comparison to,
    let's say, whether they should
    cancel third world debt?

        SPIKE
    That's right -- I'm at last going out
    on a date with the great Janine and I
    just want to be sure I've picked the
    right t-shirt.

        WILLIAM
    What are the choices?

        SPIKE
    Well... wait for it...
      (He pulls on a t-shirt)
    First there's this one...

  The t-shirt is white with a horrible looking plastic alien
  coming out of it, jaws open, blood everywhere.  It says 'I Love
  Blood.'

        WILLIAM
    Yes -- might make it hard to strike a
    really romantic note.

        SPIKE
    Point taken.

  He heads back up the stairs... talks as he changes...

        SPIKE
    I suspect you'll prefer the next one.

  And he re-enters in a white t-shirt, with a large arrow,
  pointing down to his flies, saying, 'Get It Here.'

        SPIKE
    Cool, huh?

        WILLIAM
    Yes -- she might think you don't have
    true love on your mind.

        SPIKE
    Wouldn't want that...
      (and back up he goes)
    Okay -- just one more.

  He comes down wearing it.  Lots of hearts, saying, 'You're the
  most beautiful woman in the world.'

        WILLIAM
    Well, yes, that's perfect. Well
    done.

        SPIKE
    Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.

        WILLIAM
    Good luck.

  Spike turns and walks upstairs proudly.  Revealing that on the
  back of the t-shirt, also printed in big letters, is written
  'Fancy a fuck?'

  EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY

        WILLIAM (V.O.)
    And so it was just another hopeless
    Wednesday, as I set off through the
    market to work, little suspecting
    that this was the day which would
    change my life forever.  This is
    work, by the way, my little travel
    book shop...

  A small unpretentious store... named 'The Travel Book Co.'

        WILLIAM (V.O.)
    ... which, well, sells travel books
    -- and, to be frank with you, doesn't
    always sell many of those.

  William enters.

  INT. THE BOOKSHOP - DAY

  It is a small shop, slightly chaotic, bookshelves everywhere,
  with little secret bits round corners with even more books.
  Martin, William's sole employee, is waiting enthusiastically.
  He is very keen, an uncrushable optimist.  Perhaps without
  cause.  A few seconds later, William stands gloomily behind the
  desk.

        WILLIAM
    Classic.  Absolutely classic.
    Profit from major sales push -- minus
    $B!r(J347.

        MARTIN
    Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the
    pain.

        WILLIAM
    Yes, better get me a half.  All I can
    afford.

        MARIN
    I get your logic.  Demi-capu coming up.

  He salutes and bolts out the door -- as he does, a woman walks in.
  We only just glimpse her.

  Cut to William working.  He looks up casually.  And sees
  something.  His reaction is hard to read.  After a pause...

        WILLIAM
    Can I help you?

  It is Anna Scott, the biggest movie star in the world -- here --
  in his shop.  The most divine, subtle, beautiful woman on earth.
  When she speaks she is very self-assured and self-contained.

        ANNA
    No, thanks.  I'll just look around.

        WILLIAM
    Fine.

  She wanders over to a shelf as he watches her -- and picks out a
  quite smart coffee table book.

        WILLIAM
    That book's really not good -- just
    in case, you know, browsing turned to
    buying.  You'd be wasting your money.

        ANNA
    Really?

        WILLIAM
    Yes.  This one though is... very
    good.

  He picks up a book on the counter.

        WILLIAM
    I think the man who wrote it has
    actually been to Turkey, which helps.
    There's also a very amusing incident
    with a kebab.

        ANNA
    Thanks.  I'll think about it.

  William suddenly spies something odd on the small TV monitor
  beside him.

        WILLIAM
    If you could just give me a second.

  Her eyes follow him as he moves toward the back of the shop and
  approaches a man in slightly ill-fitting clothes.

        WILLIAM
    Excuse me.

        THIEF
    Yes.

        WILLIAM
    Bad news.

        THIEF
    What?

        WILLIAM
    We've got a security camera in this
    bit of the shop.

        THIEF
    So?

        WILLIAM
    So, I saw you put that book down your
    trousers.

        THIEF
    What book?

        WILLIAM
    The one down your trousers.

        THIEF
    I haven't got a book down my trousers.

        WILLIAM
    Right -- well, then we have something
    of an impasse.  I tell you what --
    I'll call the police -- and,  what can
    I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole
    book-down-the-trousers scenario, I
    really apologize.

        THIEF
    Okay -- what if I did have a book down
    my trousers?

        WILLIAM
    Well, ideally, when I went back to
    the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan
    guide to Bali from your trousers, and
    either wipe it and put it back, or
    buy it.  See you in a sec.

  He returns to his desk.  In the monitor we just glimpse, as does
  William, the book coming out of the trousers and put back on the
  shelves.  The thief drifts out towards the door.  Anna, who has
  observed all this, is looking at a blue book on the counter.

        WILLIAM
    Sorry about that...

        ANNA
    No, that's fine.  I was going to
    steal one myself but now I've changed
    my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.

        WILLIAM
    Yes, we couldn't stop him.  If you
    can find an unsigned copy, it's
    worth an absolute fortune.

  She smiles.  Suddenly the thief is there.

        THIEF
    Excuse me.

        ANNA
    Yes.

        THIEF
    Can I have your autograph?

        ANNA
    What's your name?

        THIEF
    Rufus.

  She signs his scruffy piece of paper.  He tries to read it.

        THIEF
    What does it say?

        ANNA
    Well, that's the signature -- and
    above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you
    belong in jail.'

        THIEF
    Nice one.  Would you like my phone
    number?

        ANNA
    Tempting but... no, thank you.

  Thief leaves.

        ANNA
    I think I will try this one.

  She hands William a $B!r(J20 note and the book he said was rubbish.
  He talks as he handles the transaction.

        WILLIAM
    Oh -- right -- on second thoughts
    maybe it wasn't that bad.  Actually
    -- it's a sort of masterpiece really.
    None of those childish kebab
    stories you get in so many travel
    books these days.  And I'll throw in
    one of these for free.

  He drops in one of the signed books.

        WILLIAM
    Very useful for lighting fires,
    wrapping fish, that sort of things.

  She looks at him with a slight smile.

        ANNA
    Thanks.

  And leaves.  She's out of his life forever.  William is a little
  dazed.  Seconds later Martin comes back in.

        MARTIN
    Cappuccino as ordered.

        WILLIAM
    Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe
    who was just in here.

        MARTIN
    Who?  Someone famous?

  But William's innate natural English discretion takes over.

        WILLIAM
    No. No-one -- no-one.

  They set about drinking their coffees.

        MARTIN
    Would be exciting if someone famous
    did come into the shop though,
    wouldn't it?  Do you know -- this is
    pretty incredible actually -- I once
    saw Ringo Starr.  Or at least I think
    it was Ringo.  It might have been
    that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof,'
    Toppy.

        WILLIAM
    Topol.

        MARTIN
    That's right -- Topol.

        WILLIAM
    But Ringo Starr doesn't look
    anything like Topol.

        MARTIN
    No, well... he was quite a long way
    away.

        WILLIAM
    So it could have been neither of them?

        MARTIN
    I suppose so.

        WILLIAM
    Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes,
    is it?

        MARTIN
    Not classic, no.

  Martin shakes his head.  William drains his cappuccino.


        WILLIAM
    Right -- want another one?

        MARTIN
    Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy --
    I'll have an orange juice.

  EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY

  William sets off.

  INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

  William collects his juice in a coffee shop on Westbourne Park
  Road.

  EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY

  William swings out of the little shop -- he turns the corner of
  Portobello Road and bumps straight into Anna.  The orange
  juice,  in its foam cup, flies.  It soaks Anna.

        ANNA
    Oh Jesus.

        WILLIAM
    Here, let me help.

  He grabs some paper napkins and starts to clean it off -- getting
  far too near her breasts in the panic of it...

        ANNA
    What are you doing?!

  He jumps back.

        WILLIAM
    Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just
    over the street -- you could get
    cleaned up.

        ANNA
    No thank you.  I need to get my car
    back.

        WILLIAM
    I also have a phone.  I'm confident
    that in five minutes we can have you
    spick and span and back on the street
    again... in the non-prostitute sense
    obviously.

  In his diffident way, he is confident, despite her being
  genuinely annoyed.  She turns and looks at him.

        ANNA
    Okay.  So what does 'just over the
    street' mean -- give it to me in yards.

        WILLIAM
    Eighteen yards.  That's my house
    there.

  He doesn't lie -- it is eighteen yards away.  She looks down.
  She looks up at him.

  INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - CORRIDOR - DAY

  They enter.  She carries a few stylish bags.

        WILLIAM
    Come on in.  I'll just...

  William runs in further -- it's a mess.  He kicks some old shoes
  under the stairs, bins an unfinished pizza and hides a plate of
  breakfast in a cupboard.  She enters the kitchen.

        WILLIAM
    It's not that tidy, I fear.

  And he guides her up the stairs, after taking the bag of books
  from her...

        WILLIAM
    The bathroom is right at the top of
    the stairs and there's a phone on the
    desk up there.

  She heads upstairs.

  INT. KITCHEN - DAY

  William is tidying up frantically.  Then he hears Anna's feet on
  the stairs.  She walks down, wearing a short, sparkling black
  top beneath her leather jacket.  With her trainers still on.  He
  is dazzled by the sight of her.

        WILLIAM
    Would you like a cup of tea before
    you go?

        ANNA
    No thanks.

        WILLIAM
    Coffee?

        ANNA
    No.

        WILLIAM
    Orange juice -- probably not.

  He moves to his very empty fridge -- and offers its only contents.

        WILLIAM
    Something else cold -- coke, water,
    some disgusting sugary drink
    pretending to have something to do
    with fruits of the forest?

        ANNA
    Really, no.

        WILLIAM
    Would you like something to nibble --
    apricots, soaked in honey -- quite
    why, no one knows -- because it stops
    them tasting of apricots, and makes
    them taste like honey, and if you
    wanted honey, you'd just buy honey,
    instead of apricots, but nevertheless
    -- there we go -- yours if you want
    them.

        ANNA
    No.

        WILLIAM
    Do you always say 'no' to everything?

  Pause.  She looks at him deep.

        ANNA
    No.
      (pause)
    I better be going.  Thanks for your
    help.

        WILLIAM
    You're welcome and, may I also say...
    heavenly.

  It has taken a lot to get this out loud.  He is not a smooth-
  talking man.

        WILLIAM
    Take my one chance to say it.  After
    you've read that terrible book,
    you're certainly not going to be
    coming back to the shop.

  She smiles.  She's cool.

        ANNA
    Thank you.

        WILLIAM
    Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.

  He guides her towards the door.

        WILLIAM
    Nice to meet you.  Surreal but nice.

  In a slightly awkward moment, he shows her out the door.  He
  closes the door and shakes his head in wonder.  Then...

        WILLIAM
    'Surreal but nice.'  What was I
    thinking?

  ... He  shakes his head again in horror and wanders back along
  the corridor in silence.  There's a knock on the door.  He moves
  back, casually...

        WILLIAM
    Coming.

  He opens the door.  It's her.

        WILLIAM
    Oh hi.  Forget something?

        ANNA
    I forgot my bag.

        WILLIAM
    Oh right.

  He shoots into the kitchen and picks up the forgotten shopping
  bag.  Then returns and hands it to her.

        WILLIAM
    Here we go.

        ANNA
    Thanks.  Well...

  They stand in that corridor -- in that small space.  Second time
  saying goodbye.  A strange feeling of intimacy.  She leans
  forward and she kisses him.  Total silence.  A real sense of the
  strangeness of those lips, those famous lips on his.  They part.

        WILLIAM
    I apologize for the 'surreal but nice'
    comment.  Disaster...

        ANNA
    Don't worry about it.  I thought the
    apricot and honey business was the
    real lowpoint.

  Suddenly there is a clicking of a key in the lock.

        WILLIAM
    Oh my God.  My flatmate.  I'm sorry --
    there's no excuse for him.

  Spike walks in.

        SPIKE
    Hi.

        ANNA
    Hi.

        WILLIAM
    Hi.

  Spike walks past unsuspiciously and heads into the kitchen.

        SPIKE
    I'm just going to go into the kitchen
    to get some food -- and then I'm going
    to tell you a story that will make your
    balls shrink to the size of raisins.

  And leaves them in the corridor.

        ANNA
    Probably best not tell anyone about
    this.

        WILLIAM
    Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell
    myself sometimes but... don't worry
    -- I won't believe it.

        ANNA
    Bye.

  And she leaves, with just a touch of William's hand.  Spike
  comes out of the kitchen, eating something white out of a
  styrofoam container with a spoon.

        SPIKE
    There's something wrong with this
    yogurt.

        WILLIAM
    It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.

        SPIKE
    Well, there you go.
      (takes another big spoonful)
    On for a video fest tonight?  I've
    got some absolute classic.

  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

  The lights are off.  William and Spike on the couch, just the
  light from the TV playing on their faces.  Cut to the TV full
  screen.  There is Anna.  She is in a stylish Woody Allen type
  modern romantic comedy, 'Gramercy Park,' in black and white.

  INT. MANHATTAN ART GALLERY - DAY

  Anna's character -- Woody Anna -- is walking around the gallery
  with her famous co-star, Michael.  They should be the perfect
  couple, but there is tension.  Anna is not happy.

        MICHAEL
    Smile.

        ANNA
    No.

        MICHAEL
    Smile.

        ANNA
    I've got nothing to smile about.

        MICHAEL
    Okay in about 7 seconds, I'm going to
    ask you to marry me.

  And after a couple of seconds -- wow -- she smiles.

  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

        SPIKE
    Imagine -- somewhere in the world
    there's a man who's allowed to kiss
    her.

        WILLIAM
    Yes, she is fairly fabulous.

  INT. BOOKSHOP - DAY

  The next day.  William and Martin quietly co-existing.  An annoy-
  ing customer enters.  Mr. Smith.

        MR. SMITH
    Do you have any books by Dickens?

        WILLIAM
    No, we're a travel bookshop.  We only
    sell travel books.

        MR. SMITH
    Oh right.  How about that new John
    Grisham thriller?

        WILLIAM
    No, that's a novel too.

        MR. SMITH
    Oh right.  Have you got a copy of
    'Winnie the Pooh'?

  Pause.

        WILLIAM
    Martin -- your customer.

        MARTIN
    Can I help you?

  William looks up.  At that moment the entire window is suddenly
  taken up by the huge side of a bus, obscuring the light -- and
  entirely covered with a portrait of Anna -- from her new film,
  'Helix.'

  INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - CONDOR/LIVING ROOM - DAY

  William heads upstairs and pauses.  Spike coming down, wearing
  full body scuba diving gear.

        SPIKE
    Hey.

        WILLIAM
    Hi...

  INT. WILLIAM'S KITCHEN - DAY

  The two of them fixing a cup of tea in the kitchen.

        WILLIAM
    Just incidentally -- why are you
    wearing that?

        SPIKE
    Ahm -- combination of factors really.
    No clean clothes...

        WILLIAM
    There never will be, you know, unless
    you actually clean your clothes.

        SPIKE
    Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was
    like rooting around in your things,
    and found this, and I thought -- cool.
    Kind of spacey.

  EXT. WILLIAM'S TERRACE - DAY

  The two of them on the rooftop terrace, passing the day.
  William is reading 'The bookseller.'  The terrace is small and
  the plants aren't great -- but it overlooks London in a rather
  wonderful way.  Spike still in scuba gear, goggles on.

        SPIKE
    There's something wrong with the
    goggles though...

        WILLIAM
    No, they were prescription, so I could
    see all the fishes properly.

        SPIKE
    Groovy.  You should do more of this
    stuff.

        WILLIAM
    So -- any messages?

        SPIKE
    Yeh, I wrote a couple down.

        WILLIAM
    Two?  That's it?

        SPIKE
    You want me to write down all your
    messages?

  William closes his eyes in exasperation.

        WILLIAM
    Who were the ones you didn't write
    down from?

        SPIKE
    Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone
    completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was --
    one from your mum: she said don't
    forget lunch and her leg's hurting
    again.

        WILLIAM
    Right.  No one else?

        SPIKE
    Absolutely not.

  Spike leans back and relaxes.

        SPIKE
    Though if we're going for this
    obsessive writing-down-all-messages
    thing -- some American girl called
    Anna called a few days ago.

  William freezes -- then looks at Spike.

        WILLIAM
    What did she say?

        SPIKE
    Well, it was genuinely bizarre...
    she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then
    she said, call me at the Ritz -- and
    then gave herself a completely
    different name.

        WILLIAM
    Which was?

        SPIKE
    Absolutely no idea.  Remembering one
    name's bad enough...

  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

  William on the phone.  We hear the formal man at the other end of
  the phone.  And then intercut with him.

        WILLIAM
    Hello.

        RITZ MAN (V.O.)
    May I help you, sir?

        WILLIAM
    Ahm, look this is a very odd
    situation.  I'm a friend of Anna
    Scott's -- and she rang me at home the
    day before yesterday -- and left a
    message saying she's staying with
    you...

  INT. RITZ RECEPTION - DAY

        RITZ MAN
    I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of
    that name here, sir.

        WILLIAM
    No, that's right -- I know that.  She
    said she's using another name -- but
    the problem is she left the message
    with my flatmate, which was a serious
    mistake.

  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM

        WILLIAM (cont'd)
    Imagine if you will the stupidest
    person you've ever met -- are you
    doing that...?

  Spike happens to be in the foreground of this shot.  He's read-
  ing a newspaper.

        RITZ MAN
    Yes, sir.  I have him in my mind.

        WILLIAM
    And then double it -- and that is the
    -- what can I say -- git I'm living
    with and he cannot remember...

        SPIKE
    Try 'Flintstone.'

        WILLIAM
      (to Spike)
    What?

        SPIKE
    I think she said her name was
    'Flintstone.'

        WILLIAM
    Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to
    you?

        RITZ MAN
    I'll put you right through, sir.

  Flintstone is indeed the magic word.

        WILLIAM
    Oh my God.

  He practices how to sound.

        WILLIAM
    Hello.  Hi.  Hi.

        ANNA (V.O.)
    Hi.

  We hear her voice -- don't see her.

        WILLIAM
      (caught out)
    Oh hi.  It's William Thacker.  We,
    ahm I work in a bookshop.

        ANNA (V.O.)
    You played it pretty cool here,
    waiting for three days to call.

        WILLIAM
    No, I've never played anything cool
    in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll
    stab to death later, never gave me the
    message.

        ANNA (V.O.)
    Oh -- Okay.

        WILLIAM
    Perhaps I could drop round for tea or
    something?

        ANNA (V.O.)
    Yeh -- unfortunately, things are
    going to be pretty busy, but... okay,
    let's give it a try.  Four o'clock
    could be good.

        WILLIAM
    Right.  Great.
      (he hangs up)
    Classic.  Classic.

  EXT. RITZ - DAY

  William jumps off a bus and walks toward the Ritz.  He carries a
  small bunch of roses.

  INT. RITZ HOTEL - DAY

  He approaches the lifts.  At the lift, he pushes the button and
  the doors open.  As he is getting in, William is joined by a young
  man.  His name is Tarquin.

        WILLIAM
    Which floor?

        TARQUIN
    Three.

  William pushes the button.  They wait for the doors to close.

  INT. RITZ CORRIDOR - DAY

  The lift lands.  William gets out.  So does Tarquin.  Rooms
  30-35 are to the left.  35-39 to the right.  William heads right.
  So does Tarquin.

  William is puzzled.  He slows down as he approaches room 38.  So
  does Tarquin.  William spots, so does Tarquin.  William points
  at the number.

        WILLIAM
    Are you sure you...?

        TARQUIN
    Yes.

        WILLIAM
    Oh.  Right.

  He knocks.  A bright, well-tailored American girl opens the door.

        KAREN
    Hello, I'm Karen.  Sorry -- things
    are running a bit late.  Here's the
    thing...

  She hands them a very slick, expensively produced press kits,
  with the poster picture of Anna, for the film 'Helix.'

  INT. THE TRAFALGAR SUITE ANTE-ROOM - DAY

  A few seconds later -- they enter the main waiting room.  There
  are a number of journalists waiting for their audience.

        KAREN
    What did you think of the film?

        TARQUIN
    Marvellous.  'Close Encounters'
    meets 'Jean De Florette.'  Oscar-
    winning stuff.

  They both turn to William for his opinion.

        WILLIAM
    I agree.

        KAREN
    I'm sorry.  I didn't get down what
    magazines you're from.

        TARQUIN
    'Time Out.'

        KAREN
    Great.  And you...

        WILLIAM
      (seeing it on a coffee
       table)
    'Horse and Hound.'  The name's
    William Whacker.  I think she might
    be expecting me.

        KAREN
    Okay -- take a seat.  I'll check.

  They sit down as Karen goes off.

        TARQUIN
    You've brought her flowers?

  William goes for the cover-up.

        WILLIAM
    No -- they're... for my grandmother.
    She's in a hospital nearby.  Thought
    I'd kill two birds with one stone.

        TARQUIN
    I'm sorry.  Which hospital?

  Pause.  He's in trouble.

        WILLIAM
    Do you mind me not saying -- it's a
    rather distressing disease and the
    name of the hospital rather gives it
    away.

        TARQUIN
    Oh sure.  Of course.

        KAREN
    Mr. Thacker.

  Saved by the bell.

  INT. TRAFALGAR SUIT CORRIDOR - DAY

        KAREN
    You've got five minutes.

  He is shown in through big golden doors.  Karen stays outside.

  INT. THE TRAFALGAR SUITE SITTING ROOM - DAY

  There Anna is, framed in the window.  Glorious.

        WILLIAM
    Hi.

        ANNA
    Hello.

        WILLIAM
    I brought these, but clearly...

  There are lots of other flowers in the room.

        ANNA
    Oh no, ho -- these are great.

  A fair amount of tension.  These two people hardly know each
  other -- and the first and last time they met, they kissed.

        WILLIAM
    Sorry about not ringing back.  The
    whole two-names concept was totally too
    much for my flatman's pea-sized
    intellect.

        ANNA
    No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I
    always choose a cartoon character --
    last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.

  At which moment Jeremy, Karen's boss, comes in.  A fairly grave,
  authoritative fifty-year-old PR man consulting a list.

        JEREMY
    Everything okay?

        ANNA
    Yes, thanks.

        JEREMY
    And you are from 'Horse and Hound'
    magazine?

  William nods.

        ANNA
    Is that so?

  William shrugs his shoulders.  Jeremy settles at a little desk
  in the corner and makes notes.  A pause.  William feels he has to
  act the part.  They sit in chairs opposite each other.

        WILLIAM
    So I'll just fire away, shall I?

  Anna nods.

        WILLIAM
    Right.  Ahm... the film's great...
    and I just wondered -- whether you
    ever thought of having more...
    horses in it?

        ANNA
    Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to
    -- but it was difficult, obviously,
    being set in space.

        WILLIAM
    Obviously.  Very difficult.

  Jeremy leaves.

  William puts his head in his hands.  He was panic.

        WILLIAM
    I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they
    thrust this thing into my hand -- I
    didn't know what to do.

        ANNA
    No, it's my fault, I thought this
    would all be over by now.  I just
    wanted to sort of apologize for the
    kissing thing.  I seriously don't
    know what got in to me.  I just wanted
    to make sure you were fine about it.

        WILLIAM
    Absolutely fine about it.

  Re-enter Jeremy.

        JEREMY
    Do remember that Miss Scott is also
    keen to talk about her next project,
    which is shooting later in the summer.

        WILLIAM
    Oh yes -- excellent.  Ahm -- any horses
    in that one?  Or hounds, of course.  Our
    readers are equally intrigued by both
    species.
        ANNA
    It takes place on a submarine.

        WILLIAM
    Yes.  Right... But if there were horses,
    would you be riding them yourself or
    would you be getting a stunt horse person
    double sort of thing?

  Jeremy exits.

        WILLIAM
    I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry.
    This is the sort of thing that happens
    in dreams -- not in real life.  Good
    dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to
    see you.

        ANNA
    And what happens next in the dream?

  It's a challenge.

        WILLIAM
    Well, I suppose in the dream dream
    scenario.  I just... ahm, change my
    personality, because you can do that
    in dreams, and  walk across and kiss the
    girl but you know it'll never happen.

  Pause.  Then they move towards each other when... Jeremy
  enters.

        JEREMY
    Time's up, I'm afraid.  Sorry it was
    so short.  Did you get what you wanted?

        WILLIAM
    Very nearly.

        JEREMY
    Maybe time for one last question?

        WILLIAM
    Right.

  Jeremy goes out -- it's their last seconds.

        WILLIAM
    Are you busy tonight?

        ANNA
    Yes.

  They look at each other.  Jeremy enters, with another journalists
  in tow.  Anna and William stand and shake hands formally.

        ANNA
    Well, it was nice to meet you.
    Surreal but nice.

        WILLIAM
    Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's'
    favorite actress.  You and Black
    Beauty.  Tied.

  INT. TRAFALGAR SUITE CORRIDOR - DAY

  William exits fairly despondent and heads for the door.  Tarquin
  is in the corridor calling on his mobile phone.

        TARQUIN
    How was she?

        WILLIAM
    Fabulous.

        TARQUIN
    Wait a minute -- she took your
    grandmother's flowers?

  William can't think his way out of this.

        WILLIAM
    Yes.  That's right.  Bitch.

  He turns to go, but is accosted by Karen.

        KAREN
    If you'd like to come with me we can
    rush you through the others.

        WILLIAM
    The others?

  INT. RITZ INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

        KAREN
    Mr. Thacker's from 'Horse and Hound.'

  A forty-year-old actor with great presence warmly shakes
  William's hand.

        MALE LEAD
    Pleased to meet you.  Did you like the
    film?

        WILLIAM
    Ah... yes, enormously.

        MALE LEAD
    Well, fire away.

        WILLIAM
    Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy
    making the film?

        MALE LEAD
    I did.

        WILLIAM
    Any bit in particular?

        MALE LEAD
    Well, you tell me which bit you liked
    most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed
    making it.

        WILLIAM
    Ahm right, right, I liked the bit in
    space very much.  Did you enjoy
    making  that bit?

  INT. RITZ INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

  Same room same seat, minutes later, with a monolingual foreign
  actor and an interpreter.

        WILLIAM
    Did you identify with the character
    you were playing?

        INTERPRETER
    Te identicaste con el personaje que
    interpretabas?

        FOREIGN ACTOR
    No.

        INTERPRETER
    No.

        WILLIAM
    Ah.  Why not?

        INTERPRETER
    Por que no?

        FOREIGN ACTOR
    Porque es un robot carnivoro
    psicopata.

        INTERPRETER
    Because he is playing a psychopathic
    flesh-eating robot.

        WILLIAM
    Classic.

  INT. RITZ INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

  And now William is sitting opposite an eleven-year-old American
  girl.

        WILLIAM
    Is this your first film?

        GIRL
    No -- it's my 22nd.

        WILLIAM
    Of course it is.  Any favourite among
    the 22?

        GIRL
    Working with Leonardo.

        WILLIAM
    Da Vinci?

        GIRL
    Di Caprio.

        WILLIAM
    Of course.  And is he your favourite
    Italian film director?

  INT. RITZ CORRIDOR - DAY

  William emerges traumatized into the corridor.  It is full of
  camera crews.  And there is Karen.

        KAREN
    Mr. Thacker?

        WILLIAM
      (so weary)
    Yes?

        KAREN
    Have you got a moment?

  INT. ANNA'S SUITE SITTING ROOM - DAY

  They knock on her door.

        ANNA (V.O.)
    Come in.

  William enters.  A certain nervousness.  They are alone again.

        ANNA
    Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight
    -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told
    them I had to spend the evening with
    Britain's premier equestrian
    journalist.

        WILLIAM
    Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no --
    shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's
    birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be
    having dinner.

        ANNA
    Okay -- fine.

        WILLIAM
    But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.

        ANNA
    No, I mean, if it's fine with you,
    I'll, you know, be your date.

        WILLIAM
    You'll be my date at my little sister's
    birthday party?

        ANNA
    If that's all right.

        WILLIAM
    I'm sure it's all right.  My friend
    Max is cooking and he's acknowledged
    to be the worst cook in the world, but
    you know, you could hide the food in
    your handbag or something.

        ANNA
    Okay.

        WILLIAM
    Okay.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

  Bella and Max are in the kitchen.

        MAX
    He's bringing a girl?

        BELLA
    Miracles do happen.

        MAX
    Does the girl have a name?

        BELLA
    He wouldn't say.

        MAX
    Christ, what is going on in there?

  The oven seems to be smoking a little.  Then the bell rings.

        MAX (cont'd)
      Oh God.

  It's bad timing.  Max shoots out of the kitchen.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT

  Max heads for the door impatiently.  He opens it and turns back
  without looking at William and Anna standing there.

        MAX
    Come on in.  Vague food crisis.

  William and Anna move along the corridor to the kitchen.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

  Bella is there.

        BELLA
    Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is
    proving more complicated than
    expected.

        WILLIAM
    He's cooking guinea fowl?

        BELLA
    Don't even ask.

        ANNA
    Hi.

        BELLA
    Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting
    image of...

        WILLIAM
    Bella -- this is Anna.

        BELLA
    Right.
      (pause)

        MAX
    Okay.  Crisis over.

  He rises from his stove position.

        WILLIAM
    Max.  This is Anna.

        MAX
    Hello, Anna ahm...
      (He recognizes her -- the
       word just falls out)
    Scott -- have some wine.

        ANNA
    Thank you.

  Door bell goes.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT

  Max opens the door -- it is Honey.

        MAX
    Hi.

  She does a little pose, having worn a real party dress.

        MAX
    Yes, Happy Birthday.

  They head back along the corridor.

        MAX
    Look, your brother has brought this
    girl, and ahm...

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

  They enter the kitchen.

        HONEY
    Hi guys.
      (sees Anna)
    Oh holy fuck.

        WILLIAM
    Hun -- this is Anna.  Anna -- this is
    Honey -- she's my baby sitter.

        ANNA
    Hiya.

        HONEY
    Oh God this is one of those key moments
    in life, when it's possible you can be
    really, genuinely cool -- and I'm going
    to fail a hundred percent.  I absolutely
    and totally and utterly adore you and I
    think you're the most beautiful woman
    in the world and more importantly I
    genuinely believe and have believed for
    some time now that we can be best
    friends.  What do you think?

        ANNA
    Ahm... I think that sounds -- you know
    -- lucky me.  Happy Birthday.

  She hands her a present.

        HONEY
    Oh my God.  You gave me a present.
    We're best friends already.  Marry
    Will -- he's a really nice guy and
    then we can be sisters.

        ANNA
    I'll think about it.

  The front door bell goes.

        MAX
    That'll be Bernie.

  He heads out into the corridor to the front door.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT

  Max opens the door.

        MAX
    Hello, Bernie.

        BERNIE
    I'm sorry I'm so late.  Bollocksed up
    at work again, I fear.  Millions down
    the drain.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

  They enter the room.

        MAX
    Bernie -- this is Anna.

        BERNIE
    Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.

  Doesn't recognize her -- turns to Honey.

        BERNIE
    Honey Bunny -- happy birthday to you.
      (hands her a present)
    It's a hat.  You don't have to wear
    it or anything.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

  A minute or two later -- they are standing, drinking wine before
  dinner.  Bernie with Anna on their own -- William helping Max in
  the kitchen.

        MAX
    You haven't slept with her, have you?

        WILLIAM
    That is a cheap question and the answer
    is, of course, no comment.

        MAX
    'No comment' means 'yes.'

        WILLIAM
    No, it doesn't.

        MAX
    Do you ever masturbate?

        WILLIAM
    Definitely no comment.

        MAX
    You see -- it means 'yes.'

  Then on to Bernie's conversation.

        BERNIE
    So tell me Anna -- what do you do?

        ANNA
    I'm an actress.

        BERNIE
    Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock-
    market, so not really similar fields,
    though I have done some amateur stuff
    -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce,
    all that.  'Ooh -- careful there,
    vicar.'  Always imagined it's a
    pretty tough job, though, acting.
    I mean the wages are a scandal,
    aren't they?

        ANNA
    Well, they can be.

        BERNIE
    I see friends from university --
    clever chaps -- been in the business
    longer than you -- they're scraping
    by on seven, eight thousand a year.
    It's no life.  What sort of acting
    do you do?

        ANNA
    Films mainly.

        BERNIE
    Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the
    pay in movies?  I mean, last film you
    did, what did you get paid?

        ANNA
    Fifteen million dollars.

        BERNIE
    Right.  Right.  So that's... fairly
    good.  On the high side... have you
    tried the nuts?

        MAX
    Right -- I think we're ready.

  They all move towards the kitchen.

        ANNA
      (to Bella)
    I wonder if you could tell me where
    the...?

        BELLA
    Oh, it's just down the corridor on
    the right.

        HONEY
    I'll show you.

  A moment's silence as they leave -- then in a split second the
  others all turn to William.

        BELLA
    Quickly, quickly -- talk very quickly
    what are you doing here with Anna
    Scott?

        BERNIE
    Anna Scott?

        BELLA
    Yes.

        BERNIE
    The movie star?

        BELLA
    Yup.

        BERNIE
    Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.

  The horror of his remembered conversation slowly unfolds.
  Honey re-enters.

        HONEY
    I don't believe it.  I walked into the
    loo with her.  I was still talking when
    she started unbuttoning her jeans...
    She had to ask me to leave.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CONSERVATORY - NIGHT

  A little later.  They are sat at dinner.  Bella next to Anna.

        BELLA
    What do you think of the guinea fowl?

        ANNA
      (whispering)
    I'm a vegetarian.

        BELLA
    Oh God.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CONSERVATORY - NIGHT

  Moving on through the evening -- they are very relaxed, as they
  eat dinner.  A few seconds watching the evening going well -- Anna
  is taking this in -- real friends -- relaxed -- easy, teasing.
  And there's a cake.  Honey wears Bernie's unsuitable hat.  Anna
  watches William laughing at something and then putting his head
  in his hands with mock shame.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CONSERVATORY - NIGHT

  Coffee time.

        MAX
    Having you here, Anna, firmly
    establishes what I've long suspected,
    that we really are the most desperate
    hot of under-achievers.

        BERNIE
    Shame!

        MAX
    I'm not saying it's a bad thing, in
    fact, I think it's something we should
    take pride in.  I'm going to give the
    last brownie as a prize to the saddest
    act here.

  A little pause.  Then William turns to Bernie.

        WILLIAM
    Bernie.

        BERNIE
    Well, obviously it's me, isn't it --
    I work in the City in a job I don't
    understand and everyone keeps getting
    promoted above me.  I haven't had a
    girlfriends since... puberty and,
    well, the long and short of it is,
    nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks
    get any chubbier, they never will.

        HONEY
    Nonsense.  I fancy you.  Or I did
    before you got so far.

        MAX
    You see -- and unless I'm much mistaken,
    your job still pays you rather a lot of
    money, while Honey here, she earns
    nothing flogging her guts out at
    London's seediest record store.

        HONEY
    Yes.  And I don't have hair -- I've got
    feathers, and I've got funny goggly
    eyes, and I'm attracted to cruel men and
    ... no one'll ever marry me because my
    boosies have actually started
    shrinking.

        MAX
    You see -- incredibly sad.

        BELLA
    On the other hand, her best friend is
    Anna Scott.

        HONEY
    That's true, I can't deny it.  She
    needs me, what can I say?

        BELLA
    And most of her limbs work.  Whereas
    I'm stuck in its thing day and night,
    in a house full of ramps.  And to add
    insult to serious injury -- I've
    totally given up smoking, my favourite
    thing, and the truth is... we can't
    have a baby.

  Dead silence.

        WILLIAM
    Bella.

  Bella shrugs her shoulders.  Bernie is totally grief-struck.

        BERNIE
    No.  Not true...

        BELLA
    C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots
    of ways, but... Surely it's worth a
    brownie.

  William reaches for her hand.  Max breaks the sombre mood.

        MAX
    Well, I don't know.  Look at
    William.  Very unsuccessful
    professionally.  Divorced.  Used to
    be handsome, now kind of squidgy
    around the edges -- and absolutely
    certain never to hear from Anna again
    after she's heard that his nickname
    at school was Floppy.

  They all laugh.  Anna smiles across at William.

        WILLIAM
    So I get the brownie?

        MAX
    I think you do, yes.

        ANNA
    Wait a minute.  What about me?

        MAX
    I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the
    brownie?

        ANNA
    Well... a shot at it.

        WILLIAM
    You'll have to prove it.  This is a
    great brownie and I'm going to fight
    for it.  State your claim.

        ANNA
    Well, I've been on a diet since I was
    nineteen, which means basically I've
    been hungry for a decade.  I've had a
    sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one
    of whom hit me: and every time my heart
    gets broken it gets splashed across
    the newspapers as entertainment.
    Meantime, it cost millions to get me
    looking like this...

        HONEY
    Really?

        ANNA
    Really -- and one day, not long from
    now...

  While she says this, quiet settles around the table.  The thing
  is -- she sort of means it and is opening up to them.

        ANNA
    ... my looks will go, they'll find out
    I can't act and I'll become a sad
    middle-aged woman who looks a bit like
    someone who was famous for a while.

  Silence... they all look at her... then.

        MAX
    Nah!!!  Nice try, gorgeous -- but you
    don't fool anyone.

  The mood is instantly broken.  They all laugh.

        WILLIAM
    Pathetic effort to hog the brownie.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM/CORRIDOR - NIGHT

  Anna and William are leaving.

        ANNA
    That was such a great evening.

        MAX
    I'm delighted.

  He holds out his hand to shake.  She kisses him on the cheek.
  He stumbles back with joy.

        ANNA
    And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.

        MAX
    Now you're lying.

        ANNA
    You're right.  I told you I was bad
    at acting.

  Max loves this.

        ANNA
      (to Bella)
    Lovely to meet you.

        BELLA
    And you.  I'll wait till you've gone
    before I tell him you're a
    vegetarian.

        MAX
    No!

        ANNA
    Night, night, Honey.

        HONEY
    I'm so sorry about the loo thing.
    I meant to leave but I just...
    look, ring me if you need someone to
    go shopping with.  I know lots of
    nice, cheap places... not that money
    necessarily...
      (gives up)
    nice to meet you.

  And Honey gives her a huge hug.

        ANNA
    You too -- from now on you are my
    style guru.

  Anna and William head out... Bernie tries to save some dignity.

        BERNIE
    Love your work.

  They move to the door and wave goodbye.

  EXT. MAX AND BELLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

  William and Anna step outside.  From inside they hear a massive
  and hysterical scream of the friends letting out their true
  feelings.  William is a little embarrassed.

        WILLIAM
    Sorry -- they always do that when I
    leave the house.

  The house is in Lansdowne Road, on the edge of Notting Hill.
  They walk for a moment.  A bit of silence.

        ANNA
    Floppy, huh?

        WILLIAM
    It's the hair!  It's to do with the
    hair.

        ANNA
    Why is she in a wheelchair?

        WILLIAM
    It was an accident -- about eighteen
    months ago.

        ANNA
    And the pregnancy thing -- is that to
    do with the accident?

        WILLIAM
    You know, I'm not sure.  I don't
    think they'd tried for kids before,
    as fate would have it.

  They walk in silence for a moment.  Then...

        WILLIAM
    Would you like to come... my house is
    just...?

  She smiles and shakes her head.

        ANNA
    Too complicated.

        WILLIAM
    That's fine.

        ANNA
    Busy tomorrow?

        WILLIAM
    I thought you were leaving.

        ANNA
    I was.

  EXT. NOTTING HILL GARDEN - NIGHT

  A little later in the walk.

        ANNA
    What's in there?

  They are now walking by a five foot railing, with foliage
  behind it.

        WILLIAM
    Gardens.  All these streets round
    here have these mysterious communal
    gardens in the middle of them.
    They're like little villages.

        ANNA
    Let's go in.

        WILLIAM
    Ah no -- that's the point -- they're
    private villages -- only the people
    who live round the edges are allowed
    in.

        ANNA
    You abide by rules like that?

        WILLIAM
    Ahm...

  Her look makes it clear that she is waiting with interest on
  the answer to this.

        WILLIAM
    Heck no -- other people do -- but not
    me -- I just do what I want.

  He rattles the gate, then starts his climb -- but doesn't quite
  make it, and falls back onto the pavement...

        WILLIAM
      (casually)
    Whoopsidaisies.

        ANNA
    What did you say?

        WILLIAM
    Nothing.

        ANNA
    Yes, you did.

        WILLIAM
    No, I didn't.

        ANNA
    You said 'whoopsidaisies.'

  Tiny pause.

        WILLIAM
    I don't think so.  No one has said
    'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean
    unless they're...

        ANNA
    There's no 'unless.'  No one has said
    "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and
    even then it was only little girls
    with blonde ringlets.

        WILLIAM
    Exactly.  Here we go again.

  He fails, and unfortunately, spontaneously...

        WILLIAM
    Whoopsidaisies.

  They look at each other.

        WILLIAM
    It's a disease I've got -- it's a
    clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and
    having injections -- it won't last
    long.

        ANNA
    Step aside.

  She starts to climb.

        WILLIAM
    Actually be careful Anna -- it's
    harder than it looks...

  But she's already almost over.

        WILLIAM
    Oh no it's not -- it's easy.

  A few seconds later.  Anna jumps down into the garden.

        ANNA
    Come on, Flops.

  William clambers over with terrible difficulty, dusts himself
  off, and heads towards where she stands.

        WILLIAM
    Now seriously -- what in the world
    in this garden could make that
    ordeal worthwhile?

  She leans forward -- and, for the firs time since the first
  time -- she kisses him.  This time a proper kiss.  A tiny pause.

        WILLIAM
    Nice garden.

  EXT. MAGIC GARDEN - NIGHT

  They walk around the garden.  It's a moonlit dream.  We see
  the lights of the houses that surround the garden.  They come
  across a single, simple wooden bench.

        ANNA
    'For June, who loved this garden --
    from Joseph who always sat beside
    her.'

  We cut in and see an inscription carved into the wood.  She
  doesn't read the dates, carved below -- 'June Wetherby, 1917
  - 1992.'  She is slightly chocked by it.

        ANNA
    Some people do spend their whole
    lives together.

  He nods.  They are standing on either side of the bench,
  looking at each other.  The camera glides away from them, up
  into the night sky, leaving them alone in the garden.  Music
  plays.

  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

  William in a towel rushes downstairs, having just had a shower.
  He shoots past Spike.

        WILLIAM
    Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have
    you seen my glasses?

        SPIKE
    No, 'fraid not.

        WILLIAM
    Bollocks.
      (still searching --
       with no help from
       Spike)
    This happens every time I go to the
    cinema.  Average day, my glasses are
    everywhere -- everywhere I look,
    glasses.  But the moment I need them
    they disappear.  It's one of life's
    real cruelties.

        SPIKE
    That's compared to, like,
    earthquakes in the Far East or
    testicular cancer?

        WILLIAM
    Oh shit, is that the time?  I have to
    go.

  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM/CORRIDOR - EVENING

  He sprints downstairs, now fully dressed.

        WILLIAM
      (not meaning it)
    Thanks for your help on the glasses
    thing.

        SPIKE
      (sincerely)
    You're welcome.  Did you find them?

        WILLIAM
    Sort of.

  INT. CINEMA - NIGHT

  Mid-film.  We move across the audience.  And there is in the
  middle of it, we see Anna, watching the screen, and next to
  her, William, watching the film keenly, through his scuba-
  diving goggles.

  INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

  A very smart Japanese restaurant.  We see Anna and William
  sitting, near the end of their meal.

        ANNA
    So who left who?

        WILLIAM
    She left me.

        ANNA
    Why?

        WILLIAM
    She saw through me.

        ANNA
    Uh-oh.  That's not good.

  We've been aware of the conversation at a nearby table --
  now we can hear it.  Two slightly rowdy men.

        LAWRENCE
    No - No- No!  Give me Anna Scott any
    day.

  William and Anna look at each other.

        GERALD
    I didn't like that last film of hers.
    Fast asleep from the moment the
    lights went down.

  Again -- Anna reacts.

        LAWRENCE
    Don't really care what the films are
    like.  Any film with her in it --
    fine by me.

        GERALD
    No -- not my type at all really.  I
    prefer that other one -- blonde --
    sweet looking -- has an orgasm every
    time you take her out for a cup of
    coffee.

  Anna mouths 'Meg Ryan.'

        LAWRENCE
    Meg Ryan.

  William and Anna smile -- they're enjoying it.

        GERALD
    Drug-induced, I hear -- I believe
    she's actually in rehab as we speak.

        LAWRENCE
    Whatever, she's so clearly up for it.

  Anna's twinkle fades.

        LAWRENCE
    You know -- some girls, they're all
    'stay away chum' but Anna, she's
    absolutely gagging for it.  Do you
    know that in over fifty percent of
    languages the word for "actress" is
    the same as the word for "prostitute."

  This is horrible.

        LAWRENCE
    And Anna is your definitive actress
    -- someone really filthy you can just
    flip over...

        WILLIAM
    Right, that's it.

  He gets up and goes round the corner to the men.  There are in
  fact four of them, the two meeker men, Gavin and Harry, hanging
  on the other guys' witty words.

        WILLIAM
    I'm sorry to disturb you guys but --

        LAWRENCE
    Can I help you?

        WILLIAM
    Well, yes, I wish I hadn't overheard
    your conversation -- but I did and I
    just think, you know...

  He's not a very convincing or frightening figure.

        WILLIAM
    ...the person you're talking about
    is a real person and I think she
    probably deserves a little bit more
    consideration, rather than having
    jerks like you drooling over her...

        LAWRENCE
    Oh sod off, mate.  What are you, her
    dad?

  Anna suddenly appears at his side and whips him away without
  being recognized.

        WILLIAM
    I'm sorry.

        ANNA
    No, that's fine.  I love that you
    tried... time was I'd have done the
    same.

  They walk on and then...

        ANNA
    In fact -- give me a second.

  And she walks straight back to their table.

        ANNA
    Hi.

        LAWRENCE
    Oh my God...

        ANNA
    I'm sorry about my friend -- he's
    very sensitive.

        LAWRENCE
    No, look, I'm sorry...

        ANNA
    Please, please -- let's just leave
    it there.  I'm sure you meant no harm,
    and I'm sure it was just friendly
    banter and I'm sure you dicks are all
    the size of peanuts.  A perfect match
    for the size of your brains.  Enjoy
    your meal.  The tuna's really good.

  And she walks away.  Gerald turns to Lawrence.

        GERALD
    You prick.

  EXT. RITZ ARCADE - NIGHT

  They are walking.

        ANNA
    I shouldn't have done that.  I
    shouldn't have done that.

        WILLIAM
    No, you were brilliant

        ANNA
    I'm rash and I'm stupid and what
    am I doing with you?

        WILLIAM
    I don't know, I'm afraid.

        ANNA
    I don't know either.

  They have arrived at the end of the arcade.

        ANNA
    Here we are.
      (pause)
    Do you want to come up?

        WILLIAM
      (he hoes)
    There seem to be lots of reasons
    why I shouldn't.

        ANNA
    There are lots of reasons.  Do you
    want to come up?

  His look says yes.

        ANNA
    Give me five minutes.

  He watches her go -- and stands in the street.  Music plays.

  INT. RITZ CORRIDOR/ANNA'S SUITE - NIGHT

  William coming along the hotel corridor.  He knocks on the
  door.

        ANNA
    Hiya.

  There's something slightly awry.  He doesn't notice.

        WILLIAM
    Hi.

  He kisses her gently on the cheek.

        WILLIAM
    To be able to do that is such a
    wonderful thing.

        ANNA
      (pause)
    You've got to go.

        WILLIAM
    Why?

        ANNA
    Because my boyfriend, who I thought
    was in America, is in fact in the
    next room.

        WILLIAM
    Your boyfriend?

  He is duly shocked.  She's trying to be calm.

        ANNA
    Yes...

        JEFF (V.O.)
    Who is it?

  Jeff drifts into view behind.  He is a very famous film star and
  looks the part -- well built, very handsome.  Unshaven, he has
  magic charm, whatever he says.  Over a t-shirt, he wears a
  shirt, which he unbuttons as he talks.

        WILLIAM
    Ahm... room service.

        JEFF
    How you doing?  I thought you guys
    all wore those penguin coats.

        WILLIAM
    Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just
    changed to go home -- but I thought
    I'd just deal with this final call.

        JEFF
    Oh great.  Could you do me a favour
    and try to get us some really cold
    water up here?

        WILLIAM
    I'll see what I can do.

        JEFF
    Still, not sparkling.

        WILLIAM
    Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.

        JEFF
    Unless it's illegal in the UK to
    serve liquids below room temperature:
    I don't want you going to jail just
    to satisfy my whims...

        WILLIAM
    No, I'm sure it'll be fine.

        JEFF
    And maybe you could just adios the
    dishes and empty the trash.

        WILLIAM
    Right.

  And he does just that.  Scoops up the two used plates and heads
  to the bin.

        ANNA
    Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure
    this is not his job.

        JEFF
    I'm sorry.  Is this a problem?

        WILLIAM
    Ah -- no.  It's fine.

        JEFF
    What's your name?

        WILLIAM
    Ahm... Bernie.

  Jeff slips him a fiver.

        JEFF
    Thank you, Bernie.
      (to Anna)
    Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty
    surprise?

        ANNA
    Nice surprise.

  He kisses her.

        JEFF
    Liar.
      (to William)
    She hates surprises.  What are you
    ordering?

        ANNA
    I haven't decided.

        JEFF
    Well, don't over-do it.  I don't want
    people saying, 'There goes that
    famous actor with the big, fat
    girlfriend."

  He wanders off taking off his t-shirt.

        WILLIAM
    I better leave.

  Anna just nods.

        WILLIAM
    -- this is a fairly strange reality
    to be faced with.  To be honest, I
    don't realize...

        ANNA
    I'm sorry... I don't know what to
    say.

        WILLIAM
    I think goodbye is traditional.

  INT. RITZ CORRIDOR - NIGHT

  William walks away.

  EXT. RITZ - NIGHT

  William walks down the arcade outside the hotel.  He is
  stunned.

  EXT. LONDON BUS - NIGHT

  William sits alone on a bus.  We see him through the side
  window.  As it drives away, we see that the whole back of the
  bus is taken up with a huge picture of Anna.

  INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

  He gets into his room and sits on the bed.

  INT. SPACESHIP - NIGHT

  Space Anna, in the very hi-tech environment and a serious
  moods, fastens the last clasps on her uniform.  She takes a
  helmet type thing, and places it on her head.

  INT. CONNECT CINEMA - NIGHT

  Cut round to the Coronet cinema where this film is showing.
  It's not full.  The camera moves and finds, sitting on his
  own...William.  Just watching.  We see a momentous flash of
  light from the screen explode, reflected in his eye.

  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

  William is looking out the window, lost in thought.  Spike
  enters.

        SPIKE
    Come on -- open up -- this is me --
    Spikey -- I'm in contact with some
    quite important spiritual vibrations.
    What's wrong?

  Spike settles on the arm of a chair.  William decides to open
  up a bit...

        WILLIAM
    Well, okay.  There's this girl...

        SPIKE
    Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe.
    Good.  Speak on, dear friend.

        WILLIAM
    She's someone I just can't -- someone
    who... self-evidently can't be mine --
    and it's as if I've taken love-heroin
    -- and now I can't even have it again.
    I've opened Pandora's box.  And there's
    trouble inside.

  Spike nods thoughtfully.

        SPIKE
    Yeh.  Yeh... tricky... tricky... I
    knew a girl at school called Pandora
    ... never got to see her box though.

  He roars with laughter.  William smiles.

        WILLIAM
    Thanks.  Yes -- very helpful.

  INT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT

  Only two tables are being used.  William and his friends are
  on their first course.  Bernie reads an "Evening Standard,"
  with a picture of Anna and Jeff at Heathrow Airport.

        MAX
    You didn't know she had a boyfriend?

        WILLIAM
    No -- did you?

  Their looks make it obvious that everyone did.

        WILLIAM
    Bloody hell, I can't believe it --
    my whole life ruined because I don't
    read 'Hello' magazine.

        MAX
    Let's face facts.  This was always a
    no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess
    and you know what happens to mortals
    who get involved with the gods.

        WILLIAM
    Buggered?

        MAX
    Every time.  But don't despair -- I
    think I have the solution to your
    problems.

        WILLIAM
    Really?

  They all look to him for wise words.

        MAX
    Her name is Tessa and she works in
    the contracts department.  The hair,
    I admit, is unfashionable frizzy --
    but she's as bright as a button and
    kisses like a nymphomaniac on death
    row.  Apparently.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

  The kitchen.  William is looking uneasy.  A doorbell rings.

        MAX
    Now -- try.

  William nods.  Max heads off to the door.  We stay with William
  -- and just hear the door open and a voice come down the
  corridor.

        TESSA (V.O.)
    I got completely lost -- it's real
    difficult, isn't it?  Everything's
    got the word 'Kensington' in it --
    Kensington Park Road, Kensington
    Gardens, Kensington bloody Park
    Gardens...

  They reach the kitchen.  Tessa is a lush girl with huge hair.

        MAX
    Tessa -- this is Bella my wife.

        TESSA
    Oh hello, you're in a wheelchair.

        BELLA
    That's right.

        MAX
    And this is William.

        TESSA
    Hello William.  Max has told me
    everything about you.

        WILLIAM
      (frightened)
    Has he?

        MAX
    Wine?

        TESSA
    Oh yes please.  Come on, Willie, let's
    get sloshed.

  She turns to take the wine and William has a split second to send
  a message of panic to Bella.  She agrees -- it's bad.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/CONSERVATORY - NIGHT

  Max walks over to the table.  Honey, Bella, William and another
  girl.

        MAX
    Keziah -- some woodcock?

        KEZIAH
    No, thank you  -- I'm a fruitarian.

        MAX
    I don't realize that.

  It is left to William, who has been set up here, to fill the
  pause.

        WILLIAM
    And ahm -- what's a fruitarian exactly?

        KEZIAH
    We believe that fruits and vegetables
    have feelings so we think cooking is
    cruel.  We only eat things that have
    actually fallen from the tree or bush
    -- that are, in fact, dead already.

        WILLIAM
    Right.  Right.  Interesting stuff.
      (pause)
    So these carrots...

        KEZIAH
    Have been murdered, yes.

        WILLIAM
    Murdered?  Poor carrots.  How beastly.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CONSERVATORY - NIGHT

  Time for coffee and chocolates.  Beside William sits the final,
  perfect girl.  She is Rosie, quite young, smartly dressed,
  open-hearted.  It is just Max and William and Bella and her.

        ROSIE
    Delicious coffee.

        MAX
    Thank you.  I'm sorry about the lamb.

        ROSIE
    No -- I thought it was really, you know,
    interesting.

        WILLIAM
    Interesting means inedible.

        ROSIE
    Really inedible -- yes that's right.

  They all laugh.  It's going very well.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT

  William is with Rosie by the door -- just about to say goodbye.

        ROSIE
    Maybe we'll meet again some time.

        WILLIAM
    Yes.  That would be... great.

  She kisses him gently on the cheek.  He opens the door -- she
  walks out.  He shuts the door quietly and heads back into the
  living room...

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

  Max and Bella wait excitedly.

        MAX
    Well?

        WILLIAM
    She's perfect, perfect.

        BELLA
    And?

  William makes a gentle, exasperated gesture, then...

        WILLIAM
    I think you have forgotten...
      (he looks at them)
    what an unusual situation you have
    here -- to find someone you actually
    love, who'll love you -- the chances
    are... always miniscule.  Look at me
    -- not counting the American -- I've
    only loved two girls in my whole life,
    both total disasters.

        MAX
    That's not fair.

        WILLIAM
    No really, one of them marries me and
    then leaves me quicker than you can
    say Indiana Jones -- and the other,
    who seriously ought to have known
    better, casually marries my best
    friend.

        BELLA
      (pause)
    Still loves you though.

        WILLIAM
    In a depressingly asexual way.

        BELLA
      (pause)
    I never fancied you much actually...

  They all roar with laughter.

        BELLA
    I mean I loved you -- you were terribly
    funny.  But all that kissing my ears...

        WILLIAM
    Oh no -- this is just getting worse.
    I am going to find myself, 30 years
    from now, still on this couch.

        BELLA
    Do you want to stay?

        WILLIAM
    Why not -- all that awaits me at home
    is a masturbating Welshman.

  Music starts to play to take us through these silent scenes.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

  Max lifts Bella off her couch and carries her upstairs.

  Mix through -- William sits on the couch downstairs -- eyes wide
  open -- thinking.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - DAY

  Morning.  Max, all in his suit for the city... Bella kisses him
  goodbye.  William sees this from the kitchen.  She is also
  dressed for work -- and moves back into the kitchen to pack her
  briefcase with law books from the kitchen table.

  EXT. MAX AND BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY

  William emerges from the house, a little ruffled from a night
  away from home, a heads off.

  EXT. NEWSAGENT - DAY

  William walks past the newsagent, heading for home.  We see,
  though he doesn't, a rack of tabloid papers, all of which seem
  to have very grainy, grabbed pictures of Anna on their front
  page.  Headlines --'Anna Stunna'-- 'It's Definitely Her!'
  and 'Scott of Pantartica.'

  INT. WILLIAM'S BATHROOM - DAY

  William is shaving.  The bell goes.  He heads out to answer it.

  EXT./INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE -DAY

  William arrives at the door and opens it.  There stands a dark-
  glassed Anna.

        ANNA
    Hi.  Can I come in?

        WILLIAM
    Come in.

  She moves inside.  Her hair is a mess -- her eyes are tired.
  Nothing idealized.

  INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

  The two of them.

        ANNA
    They were taken years ago -- I know
    it was... well, I was poor and it
    happens a lot -- that's not an excuse
    -- but to make things worse, it now
    appears someone was filming me as
    well.  So what was a stupid photo-
    shoot now looks like a porno film.
    And well... the pictures have been
    solid and they're everywhere.

  William shakes his head.

        ANNA
    I don't know where to go.  The hotel
    is surrounded.

        WILLIAM
    This is the place.

        ANNA
    Thank you.  I'm just in London for two
    days -- but, with your papers, it's the
    worse place to be.

  She's very shaken.

        ANNA
    These are such horrible pictures.
    They're so grainy... they make me
    look like...

        WILLIAM
    Don't think about it.  We'll sort it
    out.  Now what would you like -- tea
    ... bath...?

        ANNA
    A bath would be great.

  INT. WILLIAM'S CORRIDOR - DAY

  Spike enters through the front door.  William doesn't hear him.
  Spike is reading newspapers with the Anna pictures in it.

        SPIKE
    Christ alive... brilliant... fantastic
    .... magnificent...

  He heads up the stairs.  Opens the bathroom door, walks in.

  INT. WILLIAM'S BATHROOM - DAY

  Spike heads for the toilet -- undoes his zip...

        ANNA
    You must be Spike.

  She's in the bath.  Spike turns in shock -- and sidles out of the
  bathroom.

  INT. WILLIAM'S CORRIDOR - DAY

  Spike calms himself down.  He then opens the bathroom door
  again -- and looks in.

  INT. WILLIAM'S BATHROOM - DAY

  Anna is still lying low in the bath.

        ANNA
    Hi.

        SPIKE
    Just checking.

  INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

  Spike comes back out into the corridor.  Looks to heaven.

        SPIKE
    Thank you, God.

  INT. WILLIAM'S KITCHEN - DAY

  William and Anna at the kitchen table, eating toast, dringking
  tea.

        ANNA
    I'm really sorry about last time.  He
    just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact,
    I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.

        WILLIAM
    No, that's fine.  It's not often one
    has the opportunity to adios the plates
    of a major Hollywood star.  It was a
    thrill for me.
      (she smiles.  Pause)
    How is he?

        ANNA
    I don't know.  It got to the point where
    I couldn't remember any of the reasons
    I loved him.  And you... and love?

        WILLIAM
    Well, there's a question -- without
    an interesting answer.

        ANNA
    I have thought about you.

        WILLIAM
    Oh no no -- no.

  He doesn't think she has to talk about this.

        ANNA
    Just anytime I've tried to keep
    things normal with anyone normal --
    it's been a disaster.

        WILLIAM
    I appreciate that absolutely.
      (changing subject
       tactfully)
    Is that the film you're doing?

        ANNA
    Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.

        WILLIAM
    Would you like me to take you through
    your lines?

        ANNA
    Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.

        WILLIAM
    Hand it over.  Basic plot?

        ANNA
    I'm a difficult but brilliant junior
    officer who in about twenty minutes
    will save the world from nuclear
    disaster.

        WILLIAM
    Well done you.

  EXT. TERRACE - DAY

  A little later.  They're in the thick of the script.

        WILLIAM
    'Message from command.  Would you like
    them to send in the HKs?'

        ANNA
    'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we
    need radar feedback before the KFT's
    return at 19 hundred -- then inform the
    Pentagon that we'll be needing black
    star cover from ten hundred through
    12.15' -- and don't you dare say one
    word about how many mistakes I made in
    that speech or I'll pelt you with
    olives.

        WILLIAM
    'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that
    on straightaway.'

        ANNA
    'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I
    make?

        WILLIAM
    Eleven.

        ANNA
    Damn.  'And Wainwright...'

        WILLIAM
    Cartwright.

        ANNA
    'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever
    your name is, I promised little Jimmy
    I'd be home for his birthday -- could
    you get a message through that I may
    be a little late.'

        WILLIAM
    'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'

        ANNA
    My son's name is Johnny?

        WILLIAM
    Yup.

        ANNA
    Well, get a message through to him
    too.

        WILLIAM
    Brilliant.
      (the scene's over)
    Word perfect I'd say.

        ANNA
    What do you think?

        WILLIAM
    Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's
    not Henry James, but it's gripping.

        ANNA
    You think I should do Henry James
    instead?

        WILLIAM
    I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James.
    But, you know -- this writer's pretty
    damn good too.

        ANNA
    Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone
    in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve
    to say 'inform the Pentagon that we
    need black star cover.'

        WILLIAM
    And I think the book is the poorer for
    it.

  Anna smiles her biggest smile of the day.  He is helping.

  INT. WILLIAM'S DINING ROOM

  Anna and William.  Sat down at table.  There's a picture
  hanging on the wall behind.

        ANNA
    I can't believe you have that picture
    on your wall.

  It is a poster of a Chagall painting of a floating wedding couple,
  with a goat as company.

        WILLIAM
    You like Chagall?

        ANNA
    I do.  It feels like how being in love
    should be.  Floating through a dark
    blue sky.

        WILLIAM
    With a goat playing a violin.

        ANNA
    Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness
    without a violin-playing goat.

  Spike enters with three pizzas.

        SPIKE
    Voila.  Carnival Calypso, for the
    Queen of Notting Hill -- pepperoni,
    pineapple and a little more
    pepperoni.

        ANNA
    Fantastic.

        WILLIAM
    I don't mention that Anna's a
    vegetarian, did I?

        SPIKE
      (pause)
    I have some parsnip stew from last week.
    If I just peel the skin off, it'll be
    perfect.

  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

  Later in the evening.  William and Anna on their own.  They're
  sipping coffee.  A few seconds of just co-existing.  Anna looks
  up.

        ANNA
    You've got big feet.

        WILLIAM
    Yes.  Always have had.

        ANNA
    You know what they say about men with
    big feet?

        WILLIAM
    No.  What's that?

        ANNA
    Big feet -- large shoes.

  He laughs.

  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

  A few hours later -- eating ice-cream out of the tub.

        ANNA
    The thing that's so irritating is that
    now I'm so totally fierce when it comes
    to nudity clauses.

        WILLIAM
    You actually have clauses in your
    contact about nudity?

        ANNA
    Definitely.  'You may show the dent at
    the top of the artist's buttocks -- but
    neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt
    person being used, the artist must have
    full consultation.'

        WILLIAM
    You have a stunt bottom?

        ANNA
    I could have a stunt bottom, yes.

        WILLIAM
    Would you be tempted to go for a
    slightly better bottom than your own?

        ANNA
    Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.

        WILLIAM
    It's one hell of a job.  What do you put
    on your passport?  Profession -- Mel
    Gibson's bottom.

        ANNA
    Actually, Mel does his own ass work.
    Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.

        WILLIAM
    The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?

        ANNA
    Both.

  INT. WILLIAM'S UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - NIGHT

  They are walking up the stairs -- and stop at the top.

        ANNA
    Today has ben a good day.  Which under
    the circumstances is... unexpected.

        WILLIAM
    Well, thank you.
      (awkward pause)
    Anyway -- time for bed.  Or...
    sofa-bed.

        ANNA
    Right.

  Pause.  She leans forward, kisses him gently, then steps into
  the bedroom and closes the door.

  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

  William downstairs -- on a sofa -- under a duvet.  Eyes open.
  Thinking.  Pause and pause.

  He waits and waits -- the ultimate 'yearn.'  But nothing
  happens.  William gets off the sofa decisively.  Sits on the
  side of it.  Then gets back in again.

  Pause, pause, then... in the darkness, a stair creaks.  There's
  someone there.

        WILLIAM
      (to himself)
    Oh my God...
      (then...)
    Hello.

        SPIKE
    Hello.  I wonder if I could have a
    little word.

  He drifts round the corner, half-naked.

        WILLIAM
    Spike.

        SPIKE
    I don't want to interfere, or anything
    ... but she's split up from her boy-
    friend, that's right isn't it?

        WILLIAM
    Maybe.

        SPIKE
    And she's in your house.

        WILLIAM
    Yes.

        SPIKE
    And you get on very well.

        WILLIAM
    Yes.

        SPIKE
    Well, isn't this perhaps a good
    opportunity to... slip her one?

        WILLIAM
    Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in
    trouble -- get a grip.

        SPIKE
    Right.  Right.  You think it's the
    wrong moment.  Fair enough.
      (pause)
    Do you mind if I have a go?

        WILLIAM
    Spike!

        SPIKE
    No -- you're right.

        WILLIAM
    I'll talk to you in the morning.

        SPIKE
    Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but
    okay.

  Back to William thinking again.  Dreamy atmosphere.  And then...
  more footsteps on the stairs.

        WILLIAM
    Oh please sod off.

        ANNA
    Okay.

        WILLIAM
    No! No.  Wait.  I... thought you were
    someone else.  I thought you were Spike.
    I'm delighted you're not.

  The darkness of the living room.  We see Anna in the shadow.

  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

  A few moments later.  William and Anna stand in the middle of
  the room.  He kisses her neck.  Then her shoulder.  What a
  miracle it is just to be able to touch this girl's skin.  Then
  he looks at her face.  That face.  He is suddenly struck by who
  it is.

        WILLIAM
    Wow.

        ANNA
    What?

  And then gets over it straight away.

        WILLIAM
    Nothing.

  And kisses her.

  INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

  The middle of the night.  They are both asleep -- a yard apart.
  In sleep, her arm reaches out, touches his shoulder and then
  she wriggles across and re-settles herself, tenderly, right
  next to him.  He is not asleep and knows how extraordinary this
  all is.

  INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - DAY

  The morning.

        WILLIAM
    It still strikes me as, well, surreal,
    that I'm allowed to see you naked.

        ANNA
    You and every person in this country.

        WILLIAM
    Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.

        ANNA
    What is it about men and nudity?
    Particularly breasts -- how can you be so
    interested in them?

        WILLIAM
    Well...

        ANNA
    No seriously.  I mean, they're just
    breasts.  Every second person in the
    world has got them...

        WILLIAM
    More than that actually, when you think
    about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very
    nice pair...

        ANNA
    But... they're odd-looking.  They're
    for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You
    must have seen a thousand of them --
    what's the fuss about?

        WILLIAM
      (pause)
    Actually, I can't think really -- let
    me just have a quick look...

  He looks under the sheet at her breasts.

        WILLIAM
    No, beats me.

  She laughs...

        ANNA
    Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to
    bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.'
    Do you feel that?

        WILLIAM
    Who was Gilda?

        ANNA
    Her most famous part -- men went to bed
    with the dream -- and they didn't like
    it when they woke up with the reality --
    do you feel that way with me?

        WILLIAM
      (pause)
    You're lovelier this morning than you
    have ever been.

        ANNA
      (very touched)
    Oh.

  She looks at him carefully.  Then leaps out of bed.

        ANNA
    I'll be back.

  INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - MORNING

  William on the bed.  The door opens.  It is Anna with a tray of
  toast and tea.

        ANNA
    Breakfast in bed.  Or lunch, or brunch.

  She heads across.  She smiles and sits on the bed.

        ANNA
    Can I stay a bit longer?

        WILLIAM
    Stay forever.

        ANNA
    Damn, I forgot the jam.

  The doorbell goes.

        ANNA
    You get the door, I'll get the jam.

  INT./EXT. WILLIAM'S CORRIDOR - DAY

  William heads down the corridor and opens the door.  Outside
  are hundreds of paparazzi -- an explosion of cameras and
  questions, of noise and light.  The press seem to fill the
  entire street.

        WILLIAM
    Jesus Christ.

  He comes back inside, snapping the door behind him.  Anna is in
  the kitchen.

        ANNA
    What?

        WILLIAM
    Don't ask.

  She heads back the corridor, with no suspicion.

        ANNA
    You're up to something...

  She thinks he's fooling around.  She opens the door, the same
  explosion.  In a split second she's inside.

        ANNA
    Oh my God.  And they got a photo of you
    dressed like that?

        WILLIAM
    Undressed like this, yes.

        ANNA
    Jesus.

  INT. WILLIAM'S KITCHEN - DAY

  Anna is on the phone.  Spike is blithely heading downstairs to
  the kitchen in just his underpants.

        SPIKE
    Morning, daring ones.

  He does a thumbs up to William -- very excited about what he knows
  was a 'result.'

        ANNA
      (on the phone)
    It's Anna.  The press are here.  No,
    there are hundreds of them.  My
    brilliant plan was not so brilliant
    after all.  Yeh, I know, I know.  Just
    get me out then.
      (she hangs up)
    Damnit.

  She heads upstairs.

        WILLIAM
    I wouldn't go outside.

        SPIKE
    Why not?

        WILLIAM
    Just take my work for it.

  The moment William goes upstairs, Spike heads for the front
  door.

  EXT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - DAY

  From outside -- we see this scrawny bloke in the frame of the
  doorway, in his grey underpants.  A thousand photos.  Spike
  poses athletically.

  INT. WILLIAM'S CORRIDOR - DAY

  Spike closes the door and wanders along to a mirror in the hall-
  way, muttering.

        SPIKE
    How did I look?

  Inspects himself.

        SPIKE
    Not bad.  No bad at all.  Well-chosen
    briefs, I'd say.  Chicks love grey.
    Mmmmm.  Nice firm buttocks.

  INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - DAY

  William enters.  He's unhappy for her.  She's almost dressed.

        WILLIAM
    How are you doing?

        ANNA
    How do you think I'm doing?

        WILLIAM
    I don't know what happened.

        ANNA
    I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd
    make a buck or two telling the papers
    where I was.

  She's packing.

        WILLIAM
    That's not true.

        ANNA
    Really?  The entire British press just
    woke up this morning and thought 'Hey --
    I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in
    that house with the blue door in Notting
    Hill.'  And then you go out in your
    goddamn underwear.

        SPIKE
      (dropping in)
    I went out in my goddamn underwear too.

        WILLIAM
    Get out, Spike.
      (he does)
    I'm so sorry.

        ANNA
    This is such a mess.  I come to you to
    protect myself against more crappy
    gossip and now I'm landed in it all
    over again.  For God's sake, I've got
    a boyfriend.

        WILLIAM
    You do?

  It's a difficult moment -- defining where they stand.

        ANNA
    As far as they're concerned I do.  And
    now tomorrow there'll be pictures of
    you in every newspapers from here to
    Timbuktu.

        WILLIAM
    I know, I know -- but... just -- let's
    stay calm...

        ANNA
    You can stay calm -- it's the perfect
    situation for you -- minimum input,
    maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever
    bump into will know.  'Well done you --
    you slept with that actress -- we've
    seen the pictures.'

        WILLIAM
    That's spectacularly unfair.

        ANNA
    Who knows, it may even help business.
    Buy a boring book about Egypt from the
    guy who screwed Anna Scott.

  She heads out.

  INT. STAIRS/LIVING ROOM - DAY

        WILLIAM
    Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down.
    Have a cup of tea.

        ANNA
    I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I
    want to go home.

  The doorbell goes.

        WILLIAM
    Spike, check who that is... and for
    God's sake put some clothes on.

  Spike leans merrily out of the window.

        SPIKE
    Looks like a chauffeur to me.

  INT. WILLIAM'S KITCHEN/CORRIDOR - DAY

  They move from the kitchen into the corridor.

        ANNA
    And remember -- Spike owes you an
    expensive dinner.  Or holiday --
    depending if he's got the brains to get
    the going rate on betrayal.

        WILLIAM
    That's not true.  And wait a minute...
    this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just
    laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the
    huge sweep of things, this stuff
    doesn't matter.

        SPIKE
    What he's going to say next is -- there
    are people starving in the Sudan.

        WILLIAM
    Well, there are.  And we don't need to
    go anywhere near that far.  My best
    friend slipped -- she slipped down-
    stairs, cracked her back and she's in a
    wheelchair for the rest of her life.
    All I'm asking for is a normal amount
    of perspective.

        ANNA
    You're right: of course, you're right.
    It's just that I've dealt with this
    garbage for ten years now -- you've had
    it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives
    are different.

        WILLIAM
    I mean -- today's newspapers will be
    lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.

        ANNA
    Excuse me?

        WILLIAM
    Well, you know -- it's just one day.
    Today's papers will all have been
    thrown away tomorrow.

        ANNA
    You really don't get it.  This story
    gets filed.  Every time anyone writes
    anything about me -- they'll dig up
    these photos.  Newspapers last forever.
    I'll regret this forever.

  He takes this in.  That's the end.

        WILLIAM
    Right.  Fine.  I will do the opposite,
    if it's all right by you -- and always be
    glad you came.  But you're right -- you
    probably better go.

  She looks at him.  The doorbell goes again.  She opens the door.
  Massive noise and photos.  Outside are her people, including
  Karen, a chauffeur, two bodyguards.  And then the door is shut
  and they're all gone.  Silence.

  INT. WILLIAM'S KITCHEN/CORRIDOR - DAY

  Spike and William sitting there.  Pause.

        WILLIAM
    Was it you?

        SPIKE
    I suppose I might have told one or two
    people down the pub.

        WILLIAM
    Right.

  He puts his head in his hands.  It's over now.

  EXT. LONDON - DAY

  As full, sad music plays -- William begins to walk through
  Notting Hill.

  This walk takes six months... as he walks, the seasons actually
  and magically change, from summer, through autumn and winter,
  back into spring...

  First it is summer -- summer fruits and flowers -- a six-month
  pregnant woman -- Honey with another leather-jacket boyfriend.

  As he walks on the rain starts to fall -- he turns up his coat
  collar -- umbrellas appear.  Followed by winter coats --
  chestnuts roasting -- Christmas trees on sale and the first hint
  of snow.

  Then he comes to Blenheim Crescent, which is startling snowscape,
  for the hundred yard, right across Ladbroke Grove.

  By the time he reaches the purple cafe, the snow is melting and
  in a few yards, it is spring again.  He passes Honey again --
  arguing with her boyfriend, walking away tearful.  Then turns
  past 'the pregnant woman' -- now holding her three-month baby.
  The camera holds on her.

  INT. BOOKSHOP - DAY

  A grey day in the bookshop.  Martin and William.  As ever.  A
  feeling that things in there ever change.

  Ten seconds pass.  Honey rushes in.  Spike, still feeling in
  disgrace, comes in with her but lingers in the doorway.

        HONEY
    Have we got something for you.
    Something which will make you love me so
    much you'll want to hug me every single
    day for the rest of my life.

        WILLIAM
    Blimey.  What's that?

        HONEY
    The phone number of Anna Scott's agent
    in London and her agent in New York.
    You can ring her.  You think about her
    all the time -- now you can ring her!

        WILLIAM
    Well, thanks, that's great.

        HONEY
    It is great, isn't it.  See you tonight.
    Hey, Marty-- sexy cardy.

  And she rushes out.  William looks at the piece of paper, folds
  it and then places it gently in the garbage bin.

  INT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT

  Bella bangs a spoon on a wine bottle.  All the friends are
  gathered in the restaurant.

        BELLA
    I have a little speech to make -- I won't
    stand up because I can't... be bothered.
    Exactly a year ago today, this man here
    started the finest restaurant in London.

        TONY
    Thank you very much.

        BELLA
    Unfortunately -- no one ever came to eat
    here.

        TONY
    A tiny hiccough.

        BELLA
    And so we must face the fact that from
    next week, we have to find somewhere
    near to eat.

  Tony's brave face breaks.  The dream is over.

        BELLA
    I just want to say to Tony -- don't take
    it personally.  The more I think about
    things, the more I see no rhyme or reason
    in life -- no one knows why some things
    work out, and some things don't -- why
    some of us get lucky -- and some of us...

        BERNIE
    ... get fired.

        BELLA
    No!

        BERNIE
    Yes, they're shifting the whole outfit
    much more towards the trading side --
    and of course...
      (he owns up)
    I was total crap.

  They're all rather stunned.

        TONY
    So we go down together!  A toast to
    Bernie -- the worst stockbroker in the
    whole world!

  They toast him.

        HONEY
    Since it's an evening of announcements
    ... I've also got one, Ahm... I've
    decided to get engaged.

  Total bewilderment from the others.

        HONEY
    I've found myself a nice, slightly odd
    looking bloke who I know is going to
    make me happy for the rest of my life.

  Special cut to Bernie -- the shot shows he had special feelings
  for Honey.

        WILLIAM
    Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I
    don't know anything about this.

        MAX
    Is it someone we know?

        HONEY
    Yes.  I will keep you informed.

  As she sits down, Honey leans towards Spike and whispers.

        HONEY
    By the way -- it's you.

        SPIKE
    Me?

        HONEY
    Yes.  What do you think?

        SPIKE
    Well, yes.  Groovy.

        MAX
    Any more announcements?

        WILLIAM
    Yes -- I feel I must apologize to
    everyone for my behavior for the last
    six months.  I have, as you know, been
    slightly down in the mouth.

        MAX
    There's an understatement.  There are
    dead people on better form.

        WILLIAM
    But I wish to make it clear I've turned
    a corner and henceforward intend to be
    impressively happy.

  INT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT

  Two hours later.  They've had a very good time.  There's been a
  chocolate cake.  Lots of alcohol.  Tony is playing 'Blue Moon'
  on the piano, and Bernie joins him, singing.

  At one table Bella and Honey sit -- beer and wine on the table.

        BELLA
    I'm really horribly drunk.

  Elsewhere, Max an William are relaxed together.

        MAX
    So -- you've laid the ghost.

        WILLIAM
    I believe I have.

        MAX
    Don't give a damn about the famous girl.

        WILLIAM
    No, don't think I do.

        MAX
    Which means you won't be distracted by
    the fact that she's back in London,
    grasping her Oscar, and to be found
    filming most days on Hampstead Heath.

  He puts down a copy of the 'Evening Standard' with a picture of
  Anna on its cover.

        WILLIAM
      (immediate gloom)
    Oh God no.

        MAX
    So not over her, in fact.

  EXT. HAMPSTEAD HEATH - DAY

  Cut to the wide sweep of Hampstead Heath.  William entirely
  alone.  He marches up a hill... goes over the crest of it -- and
  sees a huge film crew and hundreds of extras in front of the
  radiant white of Kenwood House, with its lawn and its lakes.

  EXT. KENWOOD HOUSE - DAY

  Now closer to the house, William approaches a barrier -- where
  he is himself approached.

        SECURITY
    Can I help you?

        WILLIAM
    Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...

        SECURITY
    Does she know you're coming?

        WILLIAM
    No, no.  She doesn't.

        SECURITY
    I'm afraid I can't really let you
    through then, sir.

        WILLIAM
    Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm
    not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...

        SECURITY
    ... can't let you through.

  At that moment -- thirty yards away, William sees trailer door
  open.  Out of it comes Anna -- looking extraordinary -- in a
  velvet dress; full, beautiful make-up; rich, extravagant hair.
  She has a necessary cluster of people about her.  Hair, make-up,
  costume and the third assistant who has collected her.

  She walks a few yards, and then casually turns her head.  And
  sees him.  Her face registers not jut surprise, certainly not a
  simple smile.  His being there is a complicated thing.
  Cut back to him.  He does a small wave.  She pauses as the whole
  paraphernalia of the upcoming scene passes between them.  The
  movie divides them.  But then she begins to walk through it, and
  followed by her cluster, she makes her way towards him.  When
  she reaches him, the security guard stands back a pace, and her
  people hold back.  She doesn't really know what to say...

        ANNA
    This is certainly... ah...

        WILLIAM
    I only found out you were here
    yesterday.

        ANNA
    I was going to ring... but... I didn't
    think you'd want to...

  The third assistant is under pressure.

        THIRD
    Anna.

  She looks around.  The poor third is nervous -- and the first is
  approaching.

        ANNA
      (to William)
    It's not going very well -- and it's
    our last day.

        WILLIAM
    Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.

        ANNA
    But... wait... there are things to say.

        WILLIAM
    Okay.

        ANNA
    Drink tea -- there's lots of tea.

  She is swept away, four people touching her hair and costume.

        KAREN
    Come and have a look...

  EXT. KENWOOD PARK - DAY

  As they make towards the set...

        KAREN
    Are you a fan of Henry James?

        WILLIAM
    This is Henry James film?

  EXT. KENWOOD HOUSE - DAY

  A complicated shot is about to happen -- with waves of extras --
  and a huge moving crane.  They end up next to the sound desk.

        KAREN
    This is Harry -- he'll give you a pair of
    headphones so you can hear the dialogue.

  Harry the sound man is a pleasant, fifty-year-old balding
  fellow.  He hands him the headphones.

        HARRY
    Here we go.  The volume control is on
    the side.

        WILLIAM
    That's great.

  William, the headphones on, surveys the scene -- the cluster is
  a full 100 yards from the action, to allow a gracious sweeping
  wide-shot.  He watches Anna.  She is with her co-star in the
  Henry James film -- let's call him James.

        JAMES
    We are living in cloudcuckooland --
    we'll never get this done today.

        ANNA
    We have to.  I've got to be in New York
    on Thursday.

        JAMES
    Oh, stop showing off.

  He studies an actress a few yards to the left.

        JAMES
    God, that's an enormous arse.

        ANNA
    I'm not listening.

        JAMES
    No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so
    many tragic young teenagers with
    anorexia -- and that girl has an arse
    she could perfectly well share round
    with at least ten other women -- and
    still be beg-bottomed.

        ANNA
    I said I'm not listening -- and I think,
    looking at something that firm, you and
    your droopy little excuse for an 'arse'
    would be well-advised to keep quiet.

  Back by the desk, William is listening and laughs.  That's his
  girl.  Anna prepares.

        ANNA
    So I ask you when you're going to tell
    everyone, and you say...?

        JAMES
    'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'

        ANNA
    And then I... right.

        JAMES
    Who was that rather difficult chap you
    were talking to on the way up?

        ANNA
    Oh... no one... no one.  Just some...
    guy from the past.  I don't know what
    he's doing here.  Bit of an awkward
    situation.

  EXT. HAMPSTEAD HEATH - DAY

  Cut back to William -- he has heard.

        WILLIAM
    Of course.

  He takes off the headphones and puts them gently down.

        WILLIAM
    Thank you.

        HARRY
    Anytime.

  William walks away.  The moment of hope is gone.  He couldn't
  have had a clear reminder.

  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

  William is emptying Anna Scott videos into a box.

        SPIKE
    What's going on?

        WILLIAM
    I'm going to throw out these old videos.

        SPIKE
    No.  You can't bin these.  They're
    classics.  I'm not allowing this.

        WILLIAM
    Right -- let's talk about rent...

        SPIKE
    Let me help.  We don't want all this
    shit cluttering up our lives.

  INT. BACKROOM OF THE BOOKSHOP - DAY

  The next day.  William is hard at work, doing the accounts in a
  dark small room with files in it.  Martin pops his head in.

        MARTIN
    I have to disturb you when you're
    cooking the books, but there's a
    delivery.

        WILLIAM
    Martin, can't you just deal with this
    yourself?

        MARTIN
    But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.

        WILLIAM
    Okay.  Tell me, would I have to pay a wet
    rag as much as I pay you?

  They head out, Martin behind him, incomprehensively rubbing
  his hands -- he's in a very good mood.

  INT. BOOKSHOP - DAY

  William enters -- and there stands Anna -- in a simple blue
  skirt and top.

        ANNA
    Hi.

        WILLIAM
    Hello.

        ANNA
    You disappeared.

        WILLIAM
    Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I
    didn't want to disturb you.

        ANNA
    Well... how have you been?

        WILLIAM
    Fine.  Everything much the same.  When
    they change the law Spike and I will
    marry immediately.  Whereas you...
    I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory
    ...

        ANNA
    Oh no.  It's all nonsense, believe me.
    I had no idea how much nonsense it all
    was -- but nonsense it all is...
      (she's nervous)
    Well, yesterday was our last day
    filming and so I'm just off -- but I
    brought you this from home, and...

  It's quite a big wrapped parcel, flat -- 3 foot by 4 foot,
  leaning against a bookshelf.

        ANNA
    I thought I'd give it to you.

        WILLIAM
    Thank you.  Shall I...

        ANNA
    No, don't open it yet -- I'll be
    embarrassed.

        WILLIAM
    Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know
    what it's for.  But thank you anyway.

        ANNA
    I actually had it in my apartment in New
    York and just thought you'd... but,
    when it came to it, I didn't know how to
    call you... having behaved so... badly,
    twice.  So it's been just sitting in the
    hotel.  But then... you came, so I
    figured... the thing is... the thing is
    ...

        WILLIAM
    What's the thing?

  Then the door pings.  In walks the annoying customer, Mr. Smith.

        WILLIAM
    Don't even think about it.  Go away
    immediately.

  Mr. Smith is taken aback and therefore completely obedient.

        MR. SMITH
    Right.  Sorry.

  And he leaves.

        WILLIAM
    You were saying...

        ANNA
    Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away
    today but I wondered, if I didn't,
    whether you might let me see you a bit...
    or, a lot maybe... see if you could...
    like me again.

  Pause as William takes this in.

        WILLIAM
    But yesterday... that actor asked you
    who I was... and you just dismissed me
    out of hand... I heard -- you had a
    microphone... I had headphones.

        ANNA
    You expect me to tell the truth about my
    life to the most indiscreet man in
    England?

  Martin edges up.

        MARTIN
    Excuse me -- it's your mother on the
    phone.

        WILLIAM
    Can you tell her I'll ring her back.

        MARTIN
    I actually tried that tack -- but she
    said you said that before and it's been
    twenty-four hours, and her foot that
    was purple is now a sort of blackish
    color...

        WILLIAM
    Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold
    the fort for a second will you, Martin?

  Martin is left with Anna.

        MARTIN
    Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a
    wonderful film.

        ANNA
    Is that right?

        MARTIN
    Yes... I've always wondered what
    Patrick Swayze is like in real life.

        ANNA
    I can't say I know Patrick all that
    well.

        MARTIN
    Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the
    filming?

        ANNA
    Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly --
    to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in
    'Ghost.'

  She's kind in here, not sarcastic.

        MARTIN
    Oh right.  Right.  Sorry.  Always been
    a bit of an ass.

  William returns a little uneasy.

        MARTIN
    Anyway... it's lovely to meet you.  I'm
    a great fan of yours.  And Demi's, of
    course.

  Martin leaves them.

        WILLIAM
    Sorry about that.

        ANNA
    That's fine.  There's always a pause
    when the jury goes out to consider its
    verdict.

  She's awaiting an answer.

        WILLIAM
    Anna.  Look -- I'm a fairly level-
    headed bloke.  Not often in and out of
    love.  But...

  He can't really express what he feels.

        WILLIAM
    ... can I just say 'no' to your kind
    request and leave it at that?

        ANNA
    ... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I...
    you know... of course... I'll just...
    be getting along then... nice to see
    you.

        WILLIAM
    The truth is...

  He feels he must explain.

        WILLIAM
    ... with you, I'm in real danger.  It
    took like a perfect situation, apart
    from that foul temper of yours -- but my
    relatively inexperienced heart would,
    I fear, not recover if I was once again
    ... cast aside, which I would
    absolutely expect to be.  There are too
    many pictures of you everywhere, too
    many films.  You'd go and I'd be...
    well, buggered, basically.

        ANNA
    I see.
      (pause)
    That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?

        WILLIAM
    I live in Notting Hill.  You live in
    Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world
    knows who you are.  My mother has
    trouble remembering my name.

        ANNA
    Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.

  Pause.

        ANNA
    The fame thing isn't really real, you
    know.  Don't forget -- I'm also just a
    girl.  Standing in front of a boy.
    Asking him to love her.

  Pause.  She kisses him on the cheek.

        ANNA
    Bye.

  Then turns and leaves.  Leaving him.

  INT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - DAY

  The restaurant is in the middle of being deconstructed.  The
  pictures are gone off the walls -- a kettle on a long extension
  lead is on the bare table behind.  They're all sitting there.

        WILLIAM
    What do you think?  Good move?

        HONEY
    Good move: when all is said and done,
    she's nothing special.  I saw her
    taking her pants off and I definitely
    glimpsed some cellulite down there.

        BELLA
    Good decision.  All actresses are mad
    as snakes.

        WILLIAM
    Tony -- what do you think?

        TONY
    Never met her, never want to.

        WILLIAM
    Brilliant.  Max?

        MAX
    Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.

        WILLIAM
    Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.

  Spike enters.

        SPIKE
    I was called and I came.  What's up?

        HONEY
    William has just turned down Anna Scott.

        SPIKE
    You daft prick!

  Bella is casually looking at the painting that sits beside
  William.  It is the original of the Chagall, the poster of which
  was on his wall.

        BELLA
    This painting isn't the original, is
    it?

        WILLIAM
    Yes, I think that one may be.

        BERNIE
    But she said she wanted to go out with
    you?

        WILLIAM
    Yes -- sort of...

        BERNIE
    That's nice.

        WILLIAM
    What?

        BERNIE
    Well, you know, anybody saying they
    want to go out with you is... pretty
    great... isn't it...

        WILLIAM
    It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean,
    I know she's an actress and all that, so
    she can deliver a line -- but she said
    that she might be as famous as can be --
    but also... that she was just a girl,
    standing in front of a boy, asking him
    to love her.

  They take in the line.  It totally reverses their attitudes.
  A pause.

        WILLIAM
    Oh sod a dog.  I've made the wrong
    decision, haven't I?

  They look at him.  Spike does a big nod.

        WILLIAM
    Max, how fast is your car?

  EXT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - DAY

  Max's car arrives in the street outside.  They pile into the
  car.

        MAX
    If anyone gets in our way -- we have
    small nuclear devices.

        BERNIE
    And we intend to use them!

        MAX
    Where's Bella?

        HONEY
    She's not coming.

        MAX
    Sod that.  Bernie -- in the back!

  He shoots out of his door, rushes round and grabs Bella out of
  the chair.

        MAX
    Come on, babe.

  EXT./INT. CAR. STANLEY CRESCENT/NOTTING HILL GATE - DAY

  Max's car is shooting up Stanley Crescent.  We are inside and
  outside the car.

        BELLA
    Where are you going?

        MAX
    Down Kensington Church Street, then
    Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.

        BELLA
    Crazy.  Go along Bayswater...

        HONEY
    That's right -- then Park Lane.

        BERNIE
    Or you could go right down to Cromwell
    Road, and left.

        WILLIAM
    No!

  Suddenly the car slams to a halt.

        MAX
    Stop right there!  I will decide the
    route.  All right?

        ALL
    All right.

        MAX
    James Bond never has to put up with this
    sort of shit.

  EXT. PICCADILLY - DAY

  The car turns illegally right across Piccadilly the wrong way
  down a one-way street and ends up outside the Ritz.  William
  sprints into the hotel.  Bernie follows.

        BERNIE
    Bloody hell, this is fun.

  IT. RITZ LOBBY - DAY

        WILLIAM
    Is Miss Scott staying here?

  It is the same man.

        RITZ MAN
    No, sir.

        WILLIAM
    How about Miss Flintstone?

        RITZ MAN
          No, sir.

        WILLIAM
    Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or
    Butthead?

  Man shakes his head.

        RITZ MAN
    No, sir.

        WILLIAM
    Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.

  He turns despondent and takes two steps when the Ritz Man stops
  him in his tracks.

        RITZ MAN
    There was a Miss Pocahontas in room 126
    -- but she checked out an hour ago.  I
    believe she's holding a press
    conference at The Savoy before flying to
    America.

  William is very grateful.  He kisses the Ritz Man.  Bernie's also
  gratuful.  He kisses him too.

        BERNIE
    We have lift off!!

  A Japanese guest assumes this is the way to behave and the Ritz
  Man gets kissed a third time.

  EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY

  The car speeds through London.  It gets totally stuck at a
  junction where no one will let them in.

        SPIKE
    Bugger this for a bunch of bananas.

  He gets out of the car and boldly stops the traffic coming in the
  opposite direction.  Our car shoots past him.

        SPIKE
    Go!

  They leave him behind.  Honey leans out the window and shouts...

        HONEY
    You're my hero.

  Spike waves wildly -- he loses concentration and is very nearly
  hit by a car.

  EXT. THE SAVOY - DAY

  They pull to a stop.  William leaps out.

        MAX
    Go!

  INT. THE SAVOY - DAY

  William rushes up to the main desk.

        WILLIAM
    Excuse me, where's the press
    conference?

        MAN AT SAVOY
    Are you an accredited member of the
    press?

        WILLIAM
    Yes...

  He flashes a card.

        MAN AT SAVOY
    That's a Blockbuster video membership
    card, sir.

        WILLIAM
    That's right... I work for their in-
    house magazine.
      (mimes quotation marks)
    'Movies are our business.'

        MAN AT SAVOY
    I'm sorry, sir...

  Honey shoots into shot, pushing Bella's chair.

        BELLA
    He's with me.

        MAN AT SAVOY
    And you are?

        BELLA
    Writing an article about how London
    hotels treat people in wheelchairs.

        MAN AT SAVOY
    Of course, madam.  It's in the
    Lancaster Room.  I'm afraid you're very
    late.

        HONEY
      (to William)
    Run!

  INT. SAVOR ROOM - DAY

  William runs, searching.  At last finds the room, and enters.

  INT. LANCASTER ROOM - DAY

  Huge room -- full of press.  Row after row of journalists,
  cameras at the front, TV cameras at the back.  Anna clearly
  gives press conferences very rarely, because this one is
  positively presidential.  She sits at a table at the end of the
  room, beside Karen: on her other side is Jeremy, the PR boss,
  firmly marshalling the questions.

        JEREMY
    Yes... You -- Dominic.

        QUESTIONER 1
    How much longer are you staying in the
    UK then?

        ANNA
    No time at all.  I fly out tonight.

  She's in a slightly melancholic and therefore honest mood.

        JEREMY
    Which is why we have to round it up now.
    Final questions.

  He points at a journalist he knows.

        QUESTIONER  2
    Is your decision to take a year off
    anything to do with the rumours about
    Jeff and his present leading lady?

        ANNA
    Absolutely not.

        QUESTIONER 2
    Do you believe the rumours?

        ANNA
    It's really not my business any more.
    Though I will say, from my experience,
    that rumours about Jeff... do tend to
    be true.

  They love that answer, and all scribble in their note books.
  Next question comes from someone straight right next to
  William.

        QUESTIONER 3
    Last time you were here, there were some
    fairly graphic photographs of you and a
    young English guy -- so what happened
    there?

        ANNA
    He was just a friend -- I think we're
    still friends.

        JEREMY
    Yes, the gentleman in the pink shirt.

  He is pointing straight at William, who has his hand up.

        WILLIAM
    Yes -- Miss Scott -- are there any
    circumstances in which you two might be
    more than just friends?

  Anna sees who it is asking.

        ANNA
    I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm
    assured there aren't.

        WILLIAM
    And what would you say...

        JEREMY
    No, it's just one question per person.

        ANNA
    No, let him... ask away.  You were
    saying?

        WILLIAM
    Yes, I just wondered whether if it
    turned out that this... person...

        OTHER JOURNALIST
      (to William)
    His name is Thacker.

        WILLIAM
    Thanks.  I just wondered if Mr. Thacker
    realized he'd been a daft prick and got
    down on his knees and begged you to
    reconsider, whether you would...
    reconsider.

  We cut to Max, Bella, Bernie and Honey, all watching.  Then back
  to Anna.

        ANNA
    Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.

        WILLIAM
    That's very good news.  The readers of
    'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely
    delighted.

  Anna whispers something to Jeremy.

        JEREMY
    Dominic -- if you'd like to ask your
    question again?

        QUESTIONER 1
    Yes -- Anna -- how long are you
    intending to stay here in Britain?

  Pause.  Anna looks up at William.  He nods.

        ANNA
    Indefinitely.

  They both smile -- suddenly the press gets what's going on --
  music -- noise -- they all turn and flash, flash, flash photos
  of William.  Max and Bella kiss.  Bernie kisses a total stranger.
  Spike finally makes it -- he's bright red from running.

        SPIKE
    What happened?

        HONEY
    It was good.

  Honey hugs him.  It's a new experience for Spike.

  Cut to William's face -- flash after flash -- still looking at
  Anna.  They are both smiling.

  INT./EXT. THE HEMPEL ZEN GARDEN WITH MARQUEEN - DAY

  Anna and William at their wedding -- they kiss and walk into the
  crowd.

  Honey, a bridesmaid in peach satin -- she is surrounded by at
  least four other bridesmaids, all under five.

  Nearby, Tony standing, glowing, beside his fabulous,
  pyramidical wedding cake.

  William's mother is not quite happy with how he's looking.  She
  tries to brush his hair.

  Max, dressed in the most devastating Bond-like white tuxedo is
  dancing with Anna -- thrilled.  He does a rather flashy little
  move.  Cut to Bella who is watching and laughing.

  Martin, in an awkward tweed suit, is jiggling to the beat of a
  song, entirely happy in the corner.

  EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE - NIGHT

  A huge premier -- screaming crowds -- Anna and William get out
  of the car, she holding his hand --  looking ultimately gorgeous
  -- he in a black tie that doesn't quite fit.  He's startled.

  EXT. GARDEN - DAY

  A pretty green communal garden.  Children are playing, watched
  by mothers, one of whom holds a new baby in a papoose.  A very
  old couple wander along slowly.

  A small tai chi group moves mysteriously.  And as the camera
  glides, it passes a couple sitting on a single, simple wooden
  bench overlooking the garden.  He is reading, she is just
  looking out, totally relaxed, holding his hand, pregnant.  It
  is William and Anna.

          EXT. CAROLINA MALL - MORNING
          
          ONE LONG TRACKING SHOT FROM THE BACK.
          
          A PERVERT in a trench coat runs along the edge of the
          mall. A group of OLD WOMEN is coming toward the MAIN
          ENTRANCE. The Pervert opens his trench coat and flashes
          the old women. They SCREAM!
          
          The Pervert ducks behind the bushes and runs with the
          skill of a Navy SEAL. A FAMILY is walking down the
          sidewalk. The Pervert opens his trench coat and flashes
          them.
          
          The Pervert ducks behind a dumpster. He keeps running
          and sees a car driving by. The Pervert flashes the CAR.
          
          The Pervert takes a two-step run, sees ANOTHER LADY,
          flashes her. He dives behind a car. Then pops up and
          flashes ANOTHER GIRL.
          
          It's an all-out Pervert assault!
          
          The Pervert then runs across the parking lot, jumps a
          fence, and darts from the property -- vanishing as
          quickly as a Ninja who just perfectly executed an
          assassination.

          MARK, the Mall Manager, walks by a group of women, who     
          were exposed to the Pervert. They crowd around and         
          complain loudly.

          Mark walks down the hallway that houses all of the         
          business affair offices. He stops at the RECEPTIONIST'S    
          desk.

          INT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY
          
          The Mall Manager comes into the surveillance room. It's
          a small office with monitors that show the different
          security cameras around the mall. DENNIS, a Mall
          Security guard with sunglasses who will not utter a word
          ever, turns around in the chair.

          INT. GARAGE - DAY
          
          Blackness. White shafts of light sporadically shoot
          through the dark and we see IMAGES. A GIANT FLASHLIGHT
          is inserted into a UTILITY BELT. MACE is inserted in the
          other side. A WALKIE-TALKIE is turned on. A TASER is
          sparked. MIRRORED SUNGLASSES are pushed over the nose.
          
          A garage door raises and bright light spills in...
          
          
          EXT. GARAGE - DAY
          
          A garage door opens slowly and reveals a souped-up ORANGE
          GOLF CART. There's a siren on top that spins around.
          The man driving is RONNIE BARNHARDT (28), a stocky mall
          security guard whose expression reads all business.
          Ronnie pulls out of the garage...

          EXT. MALL - DAY
          
          HEAVY METAL MUSIC. A group of anarchist SKATERS rages
          through the mall parking lot tearing up everything they
          see. A couple of them smoke cigarettes. One skater
          grinds over a bench. One kid ollies onto the hood of a
          car. Another slams into an old man and knocks him over.
          
          Meanwhile, Ronnie sits in his golf cart -- waiting. He
          looks eerily like Mel Gibson at the beginning of Mad Max.
          
          The skaters ride past a set of construction cones. One
          skater picks up the cone and tosses it across the parking
          lot.
          
          The skaters soar past Ronnie, who flips on the silent
          orange siren and gives chase.
          
          As the skaters ride through the parking lot, Ronnie pulls
          up and drives alongside of them.
          
                                  RONNIE

          STEVIE, the leader of the skaters, yells back.

          HECTOR, another skater, joins in.

          The skateboarders flip Ronnie off and push hard to get       
          away from him. Ronnie guns it and an all out chase
          ensues.

          Ronnie pulls up alongside of a SLOW SKATER. Ronnie side-
          swipes the skater, forcing the skater to run into a trash
          can and fall.
          
          Ronnie catches up to ANOTHER SKATER. This time, Ronnie
          tries to hit the skater on the side again, but he is too
          fast. Ronnie swerves trying to get him, but he dodges
          and ducks. Ronnie hits the brake. The skater thinks he
          has escaped, but looks up and sees that a car is in his
          way. The skater nails the car and is thrown over the
          hood.
          
          Ronnie is back in the chase and only Hector and Stevie
          are left. Ronnie guns the golf cart and zooms up closely
          behind the two kids.
          
          Ronnie rams Hector over and over from behind. Hector
          wobbles. Ronnie rams him again. Hector goes swerving
          off and falls down hard.
          
          Ronnie doesn't break his pace and guns it toward Stevie.
          
          Stevie is good. He turns and rides through cars, ollies
          over parking blocks, and through pedestrians. Ronnie
          burns down the lane beside him.
          
          Stevie looks behind and Ronnie is nowhere in sight.    He's
          in the clear.
          
          Stevie turns back around and sees Ronnie, driving in
          reverse straight towards him. Ronnie rams into the
          skater and knocks the poor kid on his ass.

                       trespassing. At that point, I

          BRANDI, the make-up counter girl, globs on tons of make-          
          up. She's a hot girl who looks like she's spent a few             
          sticky nights in the bed of a truck.                              
          
          Ronnie stands back and watches Brandi.       Finally, he walks
          up to her.

          Brandi looks up from her mirror and then goes back to             
          applying make-up.

                       That color looks great on your                       
                       skin. Not just that color, but                       
                       I've noticed that all make-up                        
                       looks really good on you.                            
                       Especially the blue around your                      
                       eyes. I bet it drives the men                        
                       crazy.

          Ronnie lives in a boy's room. There's all kind of
          posters up with instructions on how to execute choke
          holds, wrist locks, and other assorted death blows.
          However, the biggest decoration is a large diagram of the

          Ronnie stands in the middle of his room with his MOM
          across from him. She's an old, thick boozer, with the
          strength of a father and the love of a mother. She downs
          a full beer and throws it against the wall.

          slam her to the ground. Ronnie's Mom flips out of it on
          the ground. However, Ronnie holds onto her wrist and          
          stands up, thus locking in the submission hold.

                       they remember anything.

                       That's highly unlikely. These                      
                       incidents are usually random and                   
                       unpredictable. I'm sure you'll be                  
                       safe.

                       I'm afraid I'm going to have to                     
                       disagree with you there,                            
                       Detective. By my math, it seems                     
                       pretty clear that Brandi's been                     
                       targeted.

                       Well, how about the fact that she
                       was the first employee to get                       
                       assaulted? Not to mention the
                       fact that she is the prettiest
                       girl who works at this mall. To
                       me it seems obvious that this is
                       some sort of methodical villain
                       that plans on returning to finish
                       what he started by murdering
                       Brandi.

                       That's not going to happen.
          
          Ronnie looks at Brandi and nods his head "yes."

                       and I'm going to do everything in
                       my power to bring this guy down.

                       Look, I've got to get going.
                       Here's my card. I'll even write                     
                       my home phone number on the back,

          The living room is dark. Ronnie and Nell are on the              
          couch making out. Ronnie is starting to get frisky. His          
          hands go to Nell's boobs, but only outside of the shirt.         
          She allows it.                                                   
          
          Ronnie decides to push it. He takes his hand and tries

                       is one of the finest men I know,

                       barking up the wrong tree. Now,

                       Ronnie, nobody is accusing
                       anybody, but I would like to stick
                       around for a while and interview
                       some of the employees.

                       it quietly, so that the hoopla is

                       Harrison is here, doesn't mean

                       cool to hang out with. He carries                   
                       a badge and a gun. He probably                      
                       owns a boat. Over time, we'll

          Ronnie and Detective Harrison are in the hardware
          department talking to the SEARS MANAGER. Detective                
          Harrison sits on the ground. He has completely given up           
          on the investigation at this point, as Ronnie controls it         
          all.                                                              
          
          Ronnie picks up a hammer.

                       Now, maybe I'm crazy or maybe I'm
                       the smartest man alive, but it

          Ronnie tacks up pictures of all of the      robbery "suspects"    
          on a bulletin board. It's pictures of       Saddamn and the       
          Devil Worshipper guy. Beside him is a       sketch of the         
          Pervert. The images are on the bottom       points of a           
          Pyramid.                                                          
          
          On top of the Pyramid is a combination drawing/picture of         
          Ronnie. The body is drawn with his arms folded across             
          his chest and a photo of his face is tacked on top. The           
          whole thing adds up to nonsense, with the only clear idea         
          is that he defeats them all. Ronnie sits back in his              
          chair and stares at the board.                                    
          
          All of a sudden, there is a KNOCK at the door.      The door      
          opens and BRANDI peeps her head in.

                       I know, but let's just pretend you                 
                       drove a Toyota. Now, this Toyota                   
                       runs really good. It always                        
                       starts when you need it to and it                  
                       gets good gas mileage and you                      
                       don't have to do much to maintain                  
                       it. Then you get a really                          
                       important job like Astronaut, no                   
                       that won't work, you get a job as                  
                       the head of Wall Street. Well,                     
                       you may really like that Toyota,                   
                       but you're going to feel weird                     
                       about driving it to work every                     
                       day, right? Now let's say that                     
                       somebody offers you a chance to                    
                       get rid of that Toyota and instead                 
                       you get a Ferrari. It may be more                  
                       expensive and harder to drive, but                 
                       I mean, it just looks good as                      
                       hell. What would you do?

                       me up for our first date. I swear
                       he was the most handsome man that

                       to do good for the world. I want                   
                       you to know that if you hurt him

                       If you pass these tests, you will
                       be admitted to the police academy.
                       Now, I like to tell all new
                       recruits that they should complete
                       a ride along before making this
                       decision. It's where you actually
                       ride along with a real police
                       officer during a routine patrol.
                       It helps give you an idea of the
                       kind of situations you'll be

                       justice and protect, not just our

          to the kids...

                       attorney, one will be appointed to

                       here for my ride to come back.
          
          Ronnie turns around to look for Harrison's return, but
          instead he sees that he is surrounded by a large group of
          pissed-off GANG MEMBERS.

                       Well, I hate to be the one to tell
                       you this, but it appears that your
                       little brother has tried to sell
                       me illegal drugs. I know it's
                       hard for you to hear that.

          The Gang Members all pull out their guns and point them
          at Ronnie.

          Gang Member #1 puts the gun right up to Ronnie's head.

          Ronnie goes down on his knees.

          Ronnie reaches into his boot and pulls out a small rod.
          He flips his wrist and it extends into a night stick.
          Ronnie's begging was a trap. Ronnie pops up and begins
          dropping all those motherfuckers with lightning-fast
          precision.
          
          Ronnie breaks arms and busts heads like a fucking ninja.
          Gang Member #1 comes in and hits Ronnie with a sucker
          punch, busting his nose wide open.
          
          Ronnie stands up and goes mano y mano in a fist fight
          with Gang Member #1. He starts kicking Ronnie's ass.
          Ronnie goes down again and Gang Member #1 starts stomping
          Ronnie.
          
          Ronnie grabs Gang Member #1's leg and twists it. He
          takes him down. Ronnie jumps on top of him and begins
          beating him senseless.
          
          SLOW MOTION: Ronnie stands up and looks around at the
          pool of beaten bodies. This is Ronnie at his most primal
          and also at his best.

          SPRINT: The TESTING OFFICER blows a whistle and starts
          the 100 meter dash. Ronnie jumps off the starting line
          and hauls ass down the track. The other Trainees fall
          behind Ronnie as he smokes their asses.
          
          PULL-UPS: Ronnie jumps on the bar and begins to do pull-
          up after pull-up.
          
          SIDE SLIDE: The Testing Officer blows a whistle and
          Ronnie begins to shuffle side to side like an ice skater
          that never moves forward.
          
          SIT-UPS:     Ronnie goes hard on the sit-ups.
          
          OBSTACLE COURSE: Ronnie sprints up a wall and flips to
          the other side. He charges a body of water, then jumps

          The shadow breaks into the SHOE STORE and grabs as many           
          pairs of sneakers that it can carry. The shadow opens             
          the sliding cage and closes it from the other side. Then          
          bends down and locks it.

          slides the bars up and walks out.
          
          
          INT. MALL - DAY
          Ronnie walks through the mall and looks at the lights of
          the different shops. Everything looks colorful and
          weird. Ronnie is in his own head. This isn't the
          exciting world as before, now it's a disgusting
          fabricated make-believe land.

          The mall is kind of winding down for the day.      The stores    
          are closing and people are going home.                           
          
          Ronnie sees Nell putting her apron away and preparing to         
          leave. Ronnie walks up to her.

          Ronnie sits in his golf cart staring at the mall as the          
          last of the customers leave. That's when Ronnie sees             
          Brandi come out of the door. Brandi looks around and             
          darts across the parking lot.

          Ronnie drives around, but he can't find Brandi anywhere.         
          
          Ronnie sees a lone black car at the outer edge of the            
          parking lot. He pulls his golf cart over and climbs out.         
          
          Ronnie creeps up to the car and peers in the window.             
          Inside, Ronnie sees Brandi and Detective Harrison banging        
          like a couple of wild animals.

                       Fine, fuck you! Fuck all of you!                
                       And, Harrison, you better be glad               
                       you have a gun or I'd kick your                 
                       ass too. And you know what? I'm                 
                       taking my friendship back because               
                       you don't deserve it! And,                      
                       Brandi, I'm taking my love back                 
                       too. I'm gonna leave now and you                
                       two can just have fun. Have fun                 
                       sleeping tonight because something              
                       tells me, you won't be able to.

                       a big deal out of it.

          INT. RONNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                
          
          ON THE TELEVISION: There's an update on the CAROLINA         
          MALL FLASHER. It says he has exposed himself to more         
          girls.
          
          As the TV blares the headline, Ronnie lays in his bed and    
          watches. The images shine COLOR on him, but Ronnie is in     
          his own world.

          INT. MALL - FOOD COURT - DAY
          
          Ronnie has the Special Elite Task Force assembled.

                    I'm disbanding the task force.
          
                                  CHARLES                              
                    Hey, Ronnie, that's crazy talk.                    
                    Are you cool?                                      
          
                                  RONNIE
                    No, I'm not cool, Charles. In
                    fact, shit is seriously fucked up.
                    I've got to protect the whole mall
                    by myself. Now, I got you this
                    fucking job, when are you going to
                    stop being a little baby and do
                    something for a change.
                            (MOCKING)
                    'I don't want to do anything hard.
                    I just want to be a little bitch
                    and brag about dropping out of
                    college.' Grow a fucking pair,
                    will you, Chucky?
          
                                  CHARLES
                    I'm gonna go check the parking
                    lot.
          
          Charles walks away.
          
                                  RONNIE
                            (calling out)
                    I'm sorry, Charles! I didn't mean
                    it, buddy!
          
          Ronnie puts his head on the table.
          
                                  RONNIE
                    You know, Dennis, for the longest
                    time I made this job my whole
                    life. I looked at this mall as a
                    kingdom and I looked at Mark as
                    the King. I thought of myself as
                    the first Knight and the
                    customers, well, they were the
                    peasants. I lived by an old code
                    where one was bound by duty and
                    honor. But now I don't know if I
                    believe in that code anymore.
                    I've lost my way. Now I just feel
                    like it's one big kingdom of shit.
                    Right now, I got half a mind just                  
                    to let this whole place burn.                      
                    Burn it to the fucking ground!

          Dennis stares down at the desk. Dennis takes off his hat
          and reveals that he has bleached white Eminem hair
          underneath. Next, he reaches under his collar and flips
          out a thin gold necklace. He kicks up his shoes and
          reveals the newest and freshest basketball kicks.
          
          This is the REAL DENNIS and for the first time ever, he
          speaks...

                               (high ghetto voice)
                       I've been waiting on you to get on
                       my page this whole time. You                         
                       look at this mall as a Kingdom?!
                       Shit! I look at this place like a
                       motherfucking jail sentence. You
                       put on that uniform every morning,
                       but what are you really protecting?
                       Commerce and corporations and money.
                       Well I say, fuck that! I'm                           
                       a fucking outlaw and I'm going to
                       live that until the day I die. Now,
                       I can show you the way, but you've
                       got to be willing to accept it. So
                       I'm gonna ask you now, Ronnie. Are
                       you ready for a trip to the other side?
          
                                     RONNIE

          Dennis and Ronnie hang in the back of the mall by the
          dumpsters. Dennis sucks down a fat joint. He passes it
          to Ronnie.
          
                                     DENNIS
                       So, yeah, usually I take a joint
                       straight to the head before I
                       start work in this motherfucker,
                       but on really stressful days, I
                       like to get drunk too.
          
          Dennis pulls out a flask and gulps it down. Ronnie is
          still staring at the joint. Finally he takes a puff and
          begins violently coughing. He finally stops.

                       So then I usually come in here and
                       perv out on girls for about an
                       hour or two. I hooked up twice
                       last week. One was this Asian
                       chick and the other was this mom.
                       She wasn't that hot, but what else
                       do I got to do?
          
          Two high school girls walk by.

                                     DENNIS
                       Dressing rooms are a great place
                       to hide out, because nobody is
                       really going to think of looking
                       for me here. You can nap or just
                       kind of hang out and just really
                       have some personal time. Hey,
                       hand me that camera.
          
          Ronnie picks up a shitty camera and hands it to Dennis.
          
                                     DENNIS
                       Thanks, Ronnie.
          
          Dennis stands up on the bench and looks into the other
          changing room. The two high school girls are changing
          into other clothes. Dennis starts taking pictures of
          them without them knowing.

                       It seems only natural that 'some
                       people' would want to blame me and
                       truth be told I do put a lot of
                       that blame on myself. But some
                       people might say that the cops are
                       to blame for not catching them.
                       Some people might say that the
                       reason this happened was the
                       undeniable fact that I was under-
                       equipped and quite frankly,
                       lacking a sufficient firearm. But
                       not me. I carry this loss alone
                       deep inside my heart.

                       Just like your father did. But                      
                       not you, Ronnie. Look, whiskey                      
                       was always the way I dealt with

          Ronnie's Mom leaves and Ronnie looks at himself in the           
          mirror. Then something catches his eye. Ronnie sees a            
          newspaper laying on the ground. He picks it up and               
          reads.

          to a prisoner on the opposite side of a Plexiglas                
          divider. Ronnie sits down in wait. Then, two GUARDS              
          appear escorting a handcuffed Dennis. Dennis takes a

          Ronnie comes into the mall and makes his way down the
          center of it, feeling naked without his uniform.

          Ronnie picks himself up and starts to run again. He only
          makes it a little ways before he hits something slippery.         
          Ronnie falls onto the ground and cracks his head.
          
          Ronnie lays on the ground and sees Ramon laughing against         
          a wall with a mop in his hands.

          THE PERVERT
          
          runs past VICTORIA'S SECRET. He stops at the doorway and
          as if he can't resist, flashes the ladies in the store.
          He takes off running again.

          has made his way through the whole mall at this point,
          but Ronnie is right on his ass. The Pervert is heading
          toward the DEPARTMENT STORE.
          
          
          INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
          
          The Pervert comes barreling in and the ladies at the
          perfume and make-up counters SCREAM.
          
          He looks like he's charging straight at Brandi.    He's         
          getting closer.
          
          BOOM! Ronnie comes in from the side and nails the
          Pervert with the flashlight. Ronnie jumps on top of the
          Perv and beats the ever-living shit out of him. This is
          a vision of a man leaving all out on the field.
          
          Ronnie stops pounding and looks up. He sees Brandi              
          staring at him. Ronnie is overcome by anger and beats on
          the Pervert harder than ever before. Finally, Charles           
          comes in and pulls Ronnie off of him.
          
          A huge crowd has gathered around. Ronnie has blood all
          over him. Ronnie picks the Pervert up and holds him
          tightly by the arms. Mark comes running up.

                       with Ronnie Barnhardt, head of                       
                       Mall Security here at Carolina                       
                       Mall. Last week, Ronnie was able                     
                       to catch The CAROLINA MALL FLASHER                   
                       single-handed and bring him to                       
                       justice. Ronnie, how did you                         
                       manage to find the identity of The                   
                       Pervert and take him down?
          
                                     RONNIE
                       Well, being a mall security guard
                       basically requires the same skill
                       set that someone in say the FBI
                       has. You have to use logic and
                       evidence and old-fashioned common
                       sense as well as the latest
                       technology to deduce the criminal
                       mind. It's what I do.
          
          All of a sudden, STEVIE AND THE SKATERS come up behind            
          Ronnie. They look into the camera lens and start                  
          smiling. Ronnie turns around and sees them, but tries to          
          focus on the reporter.                                            
          
                                     FEMALE REPORTER
                       Any last words for the folks at
                       home.
          
                                     RONNIE
                       Yeah, I'd just like to say that
                       Carolina Mall is back on track and
                       safer than ever...
          
          The Skaters start flipping off the camera.       Ronnie keeps     
          getting distracted.                                               
          
                                     RONNIE                                 
                       In fact, there are some wonderful
                       sales taking place right now.                        
          
          Stevie walks up behind Ronnie and pretends to hump him.           
          
                                     RONNIE                                 
                       So for all you families out there,
                       come on down and see us. It's a                      
                       wonderful place.                                     
          
          Ronnie turns around angrily.                                      
          
                                     RONNIE                                 
                       THAT'S IT, YOU LITTLE SHIT!

          THE SKATERS jump on their skateboards and skate off.            
          Ronnie runs after them. He jumps into his GOLF CART and         
          gives chase.

          A two-story California Craftsman with a SOLD sign in the
          front yard. Yukon SUV pulls into the drive and stops.
          
          The driver's door opens and DEREK CHARLES steps out, a
          handsome and likable African-American in his early 30's; a
          guy who's fought hard to make himself a success in business
          and life. Derek wears a business suit and the first thing he
          does is cross the lawn to the SOLD sign.
          
          With a new homeowner's look of satisfaction, Derek grips the
          SOLD sign and pulls it out of the ground.
          
                                  WOMAN'S VOICE
                       Derek?
          
          D erek looks over to where his pretty wife BETH is standing
          beside the SUV, holding their cute 2 year old son KYLE in her
          arms. Beth shakes her head with amusement.
          
                                BETH
                      What are you going to do with that?
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER
          The SOLD sign, now in pieces, burns brightly in the
          fireplace. The rest of the room is empty except for KYLE who
          is nearby, asleep in his stroller. Derek and Beth's VOICES
          drift down from upstairs.
          
                                BETH'S VOICE
                      This is coming down.
          
                                DEREK'S VOICE
                      Why?
                               BETH'S VOICE
                      Do you want people to think we put it up?

                             (soft chuckle)
                        I don't know. I kind of like it.
          
                                 BETH'S VOICE
                     Please tell me you're joking.
          
                                                                             2.

          Derek and Beth stare up at their own reflections in a huge
          ceiling mirror. The rest of the room is vacant.
          
                              DEREK
                    All I'm saying, before we take it down...
                    maybe we should try it out.
                        (PLAYFUL)
                    You know. Christen the new house.
          
                              BETH
                    And what do you suggest we use for a bed?
          
                              DEREK
                    What do we need a bed for when we've got
                    a fine shag carpet?
          
                              BETH

                    tattoos all over my --
          
          Derek puts his arms around her waist and pulls her close.
          Beth resists -- but only slightly.
          
                              BETH (cont'd)
                    Don't you have to go to work?
          
                              DEREK
                        (nuzzling her neck)
                    Told `em I'd be late.
          
                              BETH
                    What about...
          
                              DEREK
                    Kyle? That boy wouldn't wake up if a
                    nuclear bomb went off.
          
                              BETH
                    Maybe not, but the movers...
          
                              DEREK
                    Won't be here for another hour.
          
          Beth smiles, giving in. They look up at themselves in the
          mirror like naughty teenagers.
          
                              BETH
                    Derek, you are so bad.

                    Somebody's got to pay for all this.
          
          They share a quick kiss and then Beth swings over to find her
          clothes.
          
          As Beth dresses, Derek stares up at himself.    He smiles with
          satisfaction. Life is good.

          load of thick files. She's in her mid-20's, white,
          beautiful, glasses and hair pulled back projecting an
          efficient, smart and sophisticated look; simple blouse and
          skirt, high heels, great legs.
          
          Lisa glances over at Derek, intrigued.

                    wrong. We haven't even gotten close to
                    that point yet. Hedge fund demand is
                    coming from individual investors which is
                    why it's gaining mainstream acceptance.
                    You know Ganz. He gets paranoid when
                    anything goes mainstream. He started
                    making Auf Wiedersehen noises but I
                    managed to talk him into a private equity
                    portfolio instead... to the tune of 155

          sneak out, Kyle lets out A CRY. They look at each other.

          the LA basin sparkles like a diamond in the night.

                       of their spouses, less likely to kick

          Derek enters, opens the refrigerator and takes out a lunch

          surprised to find Lisa seated a corner table, a little
          tearful.
          
          Lisa looks up, quickly wipes her eyes with her hand and puts
          on a smile.

                    You're no fun.
          
          Derek heads down the hall, a little unsteady.
          
          INT. MEN'S ROOM
          
          Derek enters. No one else around. He goes to the urinal and
          begins to unzip. About 30 seconds later he hears the door
          open and close but thinks nothing of it because it is a large
          public Men's restroom in the workplace with 4 urinals and 2
          stalls.
          
          But suddenly, a hand snakes around his waist and grabs his
          crotch. Derek whirls around, face to face with a brazen,
          smiling Lisa who dangles a sprig of Mistletoe in her free
          hand. Her eyes flash with desire.
          
                              DEREK

                    What are you doing?
          
          Lisa tries to kiss him. Derek resists. He staggers away
          from the urinal with Lisa still holding him.

                    Lisa --
          
          They knock open a stall door and fall in. Derek goes back
          against the toilet and Lisa is now practically straddling
          him.                 D

          That's when someone comes in. Derek kicks the stall door
          shut with his foot just in time. He and Lisa freeze, pressed
          close together as A DRUNK MALE WORKER staggers to the urinal
          and unzips.
          
          Lisa hides a GIGGLE.    Derek is horrified they'll be
          discovered.
          
          Then...
          
          The Drunk begins to piss. Loudly. And then begins to sing
          Santa Claus is coming to town... even more loud.

          In the stall, Lisa and Derek are face to face. His hand
          grabs her wrist as she squeezes his crotch. He tries to
          remove it but her grip is like a vice.

                       Oh, come on...
          
          Hearing something, the Drunk hesitates in mid-piss, looks
          back over his shoulder.
          
                                 DRUNK

                       Hey, who's there?
          
          Derek is trapped. Lisa gives him a naughty smile. She's in
          control and enjoying this, turned on by the thrill of getting
          caught.
          
                                 DRUNK (cont'd)
                       Somebody in there?
          
          Lisa is about to answer.      Derek hushes her.
          
          When there's no reply, the Drunk resumes pissing.
          
          Lisa smears the Mistletoe sprig against Derek's face, then
          starts to go down on him. He clutches her head with both
          hands forcing her to stop. She looks up at him, eyes
          gleaming with passion.

          The Drunk continues his piss. Endless. Finally.. finished.
          He clumsily zips back up, lurches over to the sink. He looks
          at himself in the mirror, runs his fingers through his hair,
          smiles at himself and then stumbles out the door.
          
          The stall door bangs open as Derek pushes Lisa aside and
          staggers out, trying to zip up his fly.

          already out the door.
          
          INT. OFFICE
          
          It's a wilder scene now. Sally Sloane is doing an
          uninhibited table dance to the delight of everyone gathered.
          
           atrick, standing off, sees Derek hurry down the hall and
          head for the elevator.
          
            moment later, he sees Lisa come down the hall and rejoin
          the party. A little tipsy, he walks over to her.

          trying to make sense of what happened.
          
          That's when he hears a SIREN. Derek's eyes go up to the rear
          view mirror in panic as a police car with flashing lights
          gains on him.
          
          Derek pulls over, heart pounding.   This is all he needs right
          now.
          
          The police car flies by on its way to some emergency.

          workers are leaving. Patrick appears at the door.
          
                                 PATRICK
                       Okay if I take off?
          
                                 DEREK
                       Yeah, go home.
          
                                 PATRICK
                       See you tomorrow.
          
          Patrick leaves. Through the open door, Derek can see other
          workers leaving, getting on the elevator. Lisa is one of
          them. She doesn't even look his way.
          
          Derek relaxes, goes back to his work.
          
                                                                       CUT TO:
          
          INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT
          
          Derek walks to his Yukon SUV, the only car remaining.        He
          BEEPS it and the doors unlock.
          
          As Derek opens the driver's door and slides inside, the
          passenger door opens and Lisa slips in, wearing her overcoat
          and an intimate smile.

          underneath.

          Derek suddenly reaches across her and throws open the
          passenger door.

          Derek physically forces her out.
          
          Derek quickly turns the key in the ignition, REVS the engine
          and peels out in reverse. The passenger door bangs shut.
          
          Lisa stands there in her overcoat staring in mute
          disappointment as Derek speeds out of the parking garage.

          Dozens of e-mails, all from the same sender: TEMPGIRL.
          A
            little fearful, Derek pulls up the first e-mail. It opens
          up to reveal a self-taken photo of Lisa looking sexy and
          inviting on a bed, smiling seductively and wearing skimpy
          lingerie that shows off her sexy body.
          
           nder her photo: SEE YOU IN THE NEW YEAR.
          
          Derek feels a jolt of panic.    He deletes it, brings up the
          others.
          
           t's the same photo, Lisa on the bed, over and over.
          
          Derek stares at Lisa on screen, feeling sick and invaded. He
          isn't aware of Beth coming out of the bathroom behind him.
          She approaches as he continues to delete.

          key and the last photo of Lisa disappears.

                    No, just the usual suspects. Joe says
                    it's going to be a male bonding
                    experience.

                    drown in the jacuzzi.

          A COCKTAIL WAITRESS delivers drinks to Derek, Joe Gage, Ben
          Talbot and THREE OTHER MEN smoking cigars and relaxing after
          dinner. The mood is rowdy. They're all a little toasted.
          
          A drink is put in front of Derek.

          The Cocktail Waitress leans down and WHISPERS in his ear:
          
                              WAITRESS
                    It's from the lady at the bar.

           erek turns and peers at the crowded bar area. He catches a
          flash of a young woman in a tight dress seated on a stool.
          But a crowd of people move into his line of vision and when
          they clear, the woman is gone.
          
          Derek tenses.

                       a bunch of drunks... Derek? You there?
          
          Derek freezes. Across the patio, he sees A FIGURE slowly
          approaching. It's a woman back-lit, a silhouette. But as
          she passes into the light from the bar, she's revealed as
          Lisa, transformed into an alluring femme fatale.

          Derek, feeling more and more disoriented, makes his way to
          his room. He fishes around in his pockets and finds his key
          card. He slides it and pushes open the door.
          
          INT. HOTEL ROOM
          
          Derek lets himself in, doesn't even click on the lights.
          There's enough moonlight coming through the window to lead
          him to the bed where he flops down on his back. He doesn't
          even bother to undress.
          
          Derek closes his eyes, then opens them. He feels sick.
          Sound and perception are playing games with his head. The
          room begins to spin and he can hear a sound, a rushing noise.
          Is it the shower in the bathroom? The bathroom door is shut
          but there's a crack of light around the edges. Is someone in
          there?

          CONTINUED:
          
          Derek is too out of it to care. He just wants to sleep, make
          it go away. He closes his eyes, begins to drift off.
          
          The bathroom door opens, letting in a cloud of steam and a
          shaft of light. A woman's silhouette appears, naked. She
          moves to the bed.
          D
           erek feels the bed move... feels a tug on his trousers...
          then, an amplified ZZZZIIIPPP.
          
          Derek's eyes open in shock. He can't believe what he sees --
          Lisa, naked, straddling him. Her hand caressing his face.
          It's like a dream. A nightmare. Lisa smiles seductively and
          puts a finger to her lips.
          
                                    LISA
                       Shhhhh.

                               word out)
                       No..

                       Hush, baby.
          
          Her voice seems distorted like it's coming from another
          world.
          
                                 LISA (cont'd)
                       I'm going to take real good care of you.
          
          Derek tries to resist but finds he has no control over his
          body or mind. All he can see is a shifting, distorted image
          of Lisa's face... her smile... her teeth.. her lips... the
          blazing look of sexual desire in her eyes. And somewhere in
          those eyes he can see HIMSELF.
          
          And that's the last thing Derek sees before he passes out and
          the entire world goes black and silent.                C
                                                                       UT TO:

          Dazzling sunlight.       Derek wakes up, startled by a pounding on
          the door.

          Derek blinks, blinded by the sun. His brain is fogged and
          he's disoriented. It takes him a moment to realize where he
          is. A hotel room. Naked under the covers. How did he...

           erek glances over at the clock. 10:15. Shit.    He's
          overslept and now he's late for the seminar.
          
          Derek starts to get up, looks over and -- his heart stops.
          
          There's Lisa sprawled beside him on her stomach, naked under
          the covers. She opens her eyes and gives him a sexy, sleepy
          smile, stretching her body like a cat.

          Derek goes into panic mode, jumping out of the bed like it's
          on fire.
          
                                 DEREK

          Derek grabs Lisa by the arm, drags her out of the bed at the
          same time gathering her clothes from the floor and thrusting
          them into her arms.

          the door and pushes her out into the hall.

          musical laugh.

          Derek locks the door. Shaking, he goes to the bed, sits on
          the edge and buries his throbbing head in his hands.

          big table. The other guys are there, also a little under the
          weather. They take notice of his late arrival.

          to him. Derek perks up with concern. He leans over to Ben,

          dressed sexy/casual, bright smile. The Clerk goes away.

                       like a stranger.

                    Yeah! That's exactly what I am. A
                    stranger, a person you don't know. Now
                    either go inside and tell them your
                    bullshit lies or get the hell out of
                    here.

          Lisa reaches out to him.
          
          Derek, in frustration, raises his hand as if to strike her.
          Her eyes flash with excitement. Derek stops himself,
          revolted by his own behavior.

                    Anything.
          
          Derek stares at her like she's a thing, an object.    He shakes
          his head.

                    I don't care what you do or what you say.
                    What goes on in that twisted mind of
                    yours. It doesn't matter because the
                    truth is, there's never going to be
                    anything between us. So go ahead,
                    Lisa... do your worst.
          
          They stare at each other.
          
          Then, Derek turns and goes into the seminar room, closing the
          door behind him.

          With a heartbreaking expression of hurt, Lisa stares at the
          door for a long moment, wipes a tear from her face and walks
          away.
          
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - THAT NIGHT
          
          Derek, Ben, Joe and the others eat dinner. A lively
          atmosphere. Derek seems apart from the others, lost in
          thought.
          
                              BEN
                    Derek, you drinking?

          Derek gets off on his floor and heads to his room.
          
          INT. HOTEL ROOM
          
          Derek steps inside and freezes, confronted with his worst
          nightmare.
          
          High heels and a path of discarded clothing leads to the bed
          where Lisa lies in bed, naked under the covers, her eyes
          shut, seemingly asleep.

          No response. Her head is cocked to one side and her skin is
          ghostly pale.
          
          Derek leans over and shakes Lisa's naked shoulder.
          
                              DEREK (cont'd)
                    Lisa, get up.

                       in the hall.
          
          That's when Derek sees it. On the night stand: an empty
          bottle of prescription pills. Derek picks up the bottle and
          looks at the label: Ambien.
          
          Derek grabs the bedside phone and punches Desk.

                       she's taken an overdose of prescription
                       pills -- Ambien. You need to get the
                       paramedics and security up here right
                       away. Please hurry.
          
          Derek hangs up. Now he puts one knee on the bed and takes
          Lisa's face in his hands, turning her head. He might as well
          be handling a marionette.

          No response. He puts his ear to her naked chest, trying to
          detect a heartbeat. If there is one, he can't hear it.
          Derek gently slaps her cheeks. Rolls back her eye lids.
          Nothing.

                       Oh god...
          
          Now Derek begins to perform CPR. He tilts Lisa's jaw back,
          clears her mouth and begins to breathe into her, alternating
          chest compressions.

          had sex, too. Beth smiles a little shyly, drops her eyes.

           amantha is sprawled on the couch. The TV is going, she's
          listening to music on her I-pod while texting a friend on her
          phone and paging through a teen magazine all at the same
          time, multi-tasking.
          
          She doesn't hear the door bell RING the first time. Or the
          second. Then there's a LOUD KNOCKING. Samantha becomes
          aware, looks around, then sees a shadowy figure through the
          frosted window next to the door.
          
          With a SIGH of annoyance, Samantha gets up and goes to the
          door. She unlocks and opens it. Lisa is standing on the
          threshold, looking fresh and pretty and smiling.

          Derek looks out and sees a police patrol car in front of the
          house. A moment later, it drives off.

          A sudden SOUND.     Derek tenses.   He hops up and goes to the
          window.
          
          It's just the sprinklers going on in the front yard.

                       Well... Beth's headed down to San Diego
                       tonight. Her mother is having some tests
                       done. Derek is driving down first thing
                       in the morning to be by her side.

                       I last night. The one my friend set me
                       up with? The graphic artist? Lisa,

          CUT TO LISA
          
          She puts her cell phone in her pocket.
          
           IDEN TO REVEAL that she's standing in a grove of trees,
          looking down at the Charles house.

          Beth goes out the front door, arms full with Kyle and
          overnight bags. She sets the alarm and shuts the door behind
          her... only to realize she forgot her purse. Beth punches
          back in, grabs the purse from inside and closes the front
          door again behind her. Forgets to re-set the alarm.

          Beth secures Kyle in his kiddie seat, then walks around to
          the driver's side, gets in and drives away.
          
          PAN UP TO Lisa watching.

          Lisa approaches the back of the house, carrying a paper bag.
          She steps up on the deck and goes to the kitchen door. She
          doesn't even check to see if it's locked. She takes the bag
          which contains a bottle of champagne and uses the bottle to
          break a pane in the kitchen door window. Then she reaches
          inside and unlocks the door.
          
          INT. KITCHEN
          
          Lisa steps inside and looks around at the cheerful room,
          Kyle's high chair, the places set for three at the table.
          L
           isa puts the champagne bottle on the counter, then humming
          happily, she begins to open shelves until she finds two
          crystal champagne flutes. She takes them down. Now she
          looks for an ice bucket and finds it.

                       and call you back.
          
          Beth clicks off. She slows down and pulls into a driveway.
          She backs out and returns up the hill.
          
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM
          
          Lisa enters, carrying the ice bucket with the champagne
          bottle in it and the two flutes. She smiles excitedly, like
          a woman preparing for her lover's return.
          
          Lisa places the champagne on the night table.
          
          She removes her coat to reveal a sexy white nightgown, then
          reaches into the coat pocket and takes out a paper bag.
          
            he upends the bag and with a giggle, begins to sprinkle red
          rose petals on the floor, making a trail to the bed.

          The ice bucket and champagne sit on the night table.
          
          Lisa stretches out on the bed, amid the rose petals, leaving
          a space for her lover beside her. She gazes up at the
          cracked ceiling mirror. She smiles at herself and, thanks to
          the cracked mirror, her smile is distorted, scary and insane-
          looking.
          
                                                                          94.

          On the bed, Lisa hears the car.
          
          She rolls off the bed and crosses to the window, parting the
          curtains to look out.

          Beth lets herself in. She's about to set the alarm when she
          hears the floor creak above her.
          
          Beth freezes.    She waits, listens.
          
          No further sound.    But Beth knows.
          
          Beth goes to the front door as if to leave. She opens the
          door and closes it as if she left the house.
          
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM
          
          Lisa, standing very still near the window, hears the sound of
          the door opening downstairs, then closing.
          
          Relieved, she moves to the window and peers out, expecting to
          see Beth getting into the car. But there's no sight of her.
          
          INT. FOYER

          Lisa whirls around. Beth is standing in the doorway, giving
          Lisa a deadly look, like a cat who's just trapped a mouse.
          
          Beth takes notice of the rose petals on the bed and floor.
          
          Lisa is wide-eyed, terrified, caught. Lisa begins to edge her
          way around the room.

          Lisa's eyes dart around for escape.   Beth seems remarkably
          calm.

                    your life... bitch.
          
          And she means it, too.
          
          Lisa tries to dart around her. But Beth cuts her off,
          grabbing Lisa by the throat and forcing her back, slamming
          her hard against the bed post.
          L
           isa bounces off the post, stunned. Beth is on her, slapping
          her hard, grabbing a handful of Lisa's hair, ripping it out
          by the roots as Lisa tries to get free. Lisa lets out a
          subhuman shriek of pain.
          
          Beth tosses the hank of hair aside, keeps on coming.    She's
          beyond pissed.

          to protect herself with.

          Lisa lands on the floor and gets up, rose petals sticking to
          her gown.
          
          As Beth comes out of the bathroom, Lisa lunges for the night
          table and grabs the bottle of champagne. She swings it and
          hits Beth is the side of the head. Whack! The cork pops and
          champagne goes spewing everywhere.
          
          Stunned, Beth goes down on her knees. Lisa wipes blood from
          her face, circling Beth, lips drawn back and teeth showing
          like an animal.
          
                               LISA
                     He doesn't love you! I'm the one he
                     wants!
                         (crazed; screaming)
                     Why can't you get that through your head?
          
          Lisa raises the bottle to hit her again.
          
          Beth lunges forward and tackles her. The bottle goes flying
          as the two women thrash around on the floor.

          Beth and Lisa fight on the floor like two she-demons.   Lisa
          breaks free from Beth.
          
          She crawls to the head of the stairs and grabs the post,
          pulling herself to her feet, eager to escape.

                     stairs.
          
          Beth gives Lisa a shove. Lisa goes crashing down the stairs
          and lands at the bottom in a heap.
          
          Beth descends.

          Lisa rises to her feet, wobbly.       She raises bloody hands in
          surrender.

          Lisa turns and desperately hobbles for the front door. But
          Beth easily beats her to it, knocking Lisa aside and throwing
          the chain.

          Lisa tries to make it to the kitchen to get the phone. Beth
          grabs her by the sleeve and pulls her back. The sleeve tears
          loose in Beth's hand.

          Lisa stumbles back toward the stairs. She scrambles upward,
          thinking maybe she can get to the phone in the bedroom.
          
          Lisa reaches the top step just as Beth snags her ankle,
          stopping her. Lisa rolls around and viciously kicks Beth in
          the shoulder with her other leg. Beth falls back, tumbles
          halfway down the stairs.

          Before she can answer, Beth is suddenly there. She rips the
          phone from Lisa's hand and strikes her with it. As Lisa
          stumbles back into the hall landing, Beth speaks calmly, even
          sweetly, into the receiver.

          into his cell as he runs to the elevator. A nervous Patrick
          watches Derek exit...

          Beth goes out into the hall and Lisa springs on her.
          
           he two women fight, going up against the bannister. They
          claw and punch at each other. With renewed strength, Lisa
          forces Beth up against the bannister. Beth looks over the
          side and down...
          
          Fifteen feet below is that large glass dining table.
          
          Lisa bangs Beth against the bannister. A few feet away is a
          heavy crystal chandelier suspended from the ceiling by a
          metal chain.
          T
           he bannister rail begins to crack. Lisa tries to force Beth
          over, then Beth suddenly swings them around, reversing
          positions --
          
          The bannister cracks, breaks apart and Lisa topples over the
          side.
          
          As she's about to fall, Lisa reaches out and grabs the
          chandelier with both hands.
          
          By a miracle, it supports her and she swings back and forth
          like a human pendulum but now the chandelier is beginning to
          pull loose from it's ceiling mount. Plaster cracks and rips
          away.
          
          Lisa swings back and forth, dangling.
          
          Beth stands on the landing. She looks at terrified Lisa,
          then up at the ceiling mount. It won't take Lisa's weight
          much longer.
          
          And both women know it.
          
          Lisa hangs by one hand, reaching out with her other hand to
          Beth who could pull her to safety.

                    Please....
          
          Beth considers. Then, as if coming out of dream, she slowly
          reaches out to Lisa. Their hands lock together. Beth slowly
          pulls Lisa toward her, toward safety.

          And, trusting, Lisa lets go.
          
          But so does Beth!!!
          
          With a look of horror on her face, Lisa falls through space.
          The soundtrack goes dead silent as we go into slow motion.
          
          Down, down, down Lisa falls. Her arms and legs flop around
          like a marionette with its strings cut, clawing the air.
          
          The fall seems endless.
          
          Then... Lisa hits the glass dining table with her back.    Her
          whole body buckles. The surface of the table ripples.
          
          In slow mo, the glass shatters and explodes around Lisa,
          framing her entire body, forming a halo around her head.
          Sound returns -- the sound of breaking glass -- and it's
          deafening.
          
          The table gives way and Lisa lands hard on the marble floor,
          her skull cracking. Her back is probably broken but she's
          still conscious.
          
           ying there, Lisa stares up at Beth on the landing as glass
          bounces and TINKLES around her.
          
          The two enemies lock eyes.   Beth's face is impassive.
          
          Lisa opens her mouth, trying to speak.
          
          And that's when the chandelier breaks loose.

          Beth and Reyes lock eyes. Reyes nods her understanding. Beth
          nods back, gets in the car, starts the engine and backs out
          of the drive. Reyes watches her exit.

          She picks up her ringing cell phone, looks at the caller ID

            This is a copy of the 1st revised draft of Omega Man, back when it was still titled I Am Legend. I obtained a copy of this script from a charity auction for retired actors; the script was signed by Charlton Heston and Producer Walter Seltzer. I AM LEGEND Screenplay By John William Corrington First Draft: 6/26/70 Revised: 7/18/70 Property of Walter Seltzer Productions Inc. Warner Bros. Studios I AM LEGEND FADE IN: WIDE ANGLE MED. LONG SHOT WE SEE a palm-lined richly attractive street in a Los Angeles suburb. The houses are set back from the street; the street itself is quiet, empty -- except for a few cars parked in front of the houses. While the camera takes no notice, the tires are down on the parked cars, the lawns of the houses are uncut. A Ford experimental model convertible turns corner INTO VIEW. It drives at a medium speed. MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR - HEAD ON ROBERT NEVILLE is driving car. He wears sunglasses, a sport shirt, a neckerchief, and looks altogether like a wealthy man out for a drive. CAMERA ALLOWS CAR TO PULL ABREAST, so that SHOT BECOMES SIDE ANGLE. As the CAMERA ENTERS passenger space of the car, we HEAR MUSIC, "Everybody's Out Of Town." Neville hums along with it. He seems at ease, unconcerned. We SEE the houses on his right side passing by. Then his humming stops, his jaw tightens. The car stops with vicious suddenness, and CAMERA PULLS BACK to MED. SHOT, as if aghast at the sight to follow. Neville, in a single motion of astonishing speed, comes up with a sten gun in his right hand, fires directly INTO CAMERA. REVERSE SHOT - DARKENED BALCONY WINDOW OF HOUSE CAMERA ZOOMS IN from MED. LONG to MED. CLOSE SHOT of a deeply shadowed window in one of the houses. Bullets smash into the frame of the window, tear out chunks of the stucco. We SEE, barely, a figure fall backward. We cannot see any details of the figure. Its presence is more intuited than seen. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S FACE IN F.G. is Nevilles sten gun, almost obscuring his features. FREEZE-FRAME. CUT TO: CREDIT MONTAGE A rapid series of SHOTS as titles begin. Title of film is not shown now but held to the last frame of the film. Titles begin with star names, etc. and are distributed over following scenes except where noted. ALIEN MISSILE being raised to point toward sky. FACE OF CHINESE SOLDIER twisted with anger, SCREAMING. TV SCREEN - IN THE CLEAR - MATTHIAS READING NEWS MATTHIAS ... the Sino-Russian border war continues to escalate, according to... ANOTHER MISSILE RISING. Under this and subsequent FLASH CUTS there should be the constant CRACKLING SOUND of RADIO transmissions in Russian and Chinese. MEETING ROOM with a small number of officials angry, frightened. On the wall behind there are crossed red flags, a portrait of Lenin. ANOTHER MISSILE. We HEAR, overlapping one another, Chinese and Russian VOICES counting down almost together from ten to one like a chorus of doom. Missile is fired SOUND BREAKS OFF. FLASH CUTS OF SERIES OF ATOMIC BLASTS, one after another, each one a slightly CLOSER SHOT, garbled RADIO TRANSMISSIONS under SHOTS -- including French, Russian, Chinese, British and American accents. BRITISH ...totalyes, totalno survivor (break)The embassyterrible... AMERICAN Jesus, Jesus Christ...you never (break) ...Vladivastok ... nothing ... nothing... INT. OMAHA SITUATION ROOM with giant illuminated wall-map of world, various equipment, military personnel sitting at consoles. In F.G. a YOUNG OFFICER is leaning across a desk, speaking to OLDER OFFICER. In his face is real fear. OFFICER Theyve ... gone ape, Sir ... gone ape... As he speaks, WE HEAR the CRACKLING ground-bass of radio TRANSMISSIONS, cut, broken. "Condition Yellow ... Yellow Alert ... Attention ... Yellow Alert..." ZOOM SHOT - PAST OFFICERTS FACE TO ILLUMINATED WALL MAP At edge, we begin to SEE RADAR-STYLE BLIPS approaching North American continent from East. Radio transmissions increase in intensity, volume, and in the GARBLED HYSTERIA, which is just below the voices. "Condition Red ... Red... Red ... Bogies on screen ... origin ... What is origin? What is origin?... Asia ... no, Jesus, from all over. They're both ... we see... both of them are ... PROCESS SHOT - MISSILES IN SPACE SOUND is killed for this and similar SHOTS. Alien missiles apparently motionless in space with the earth turning very slowly below. MED. CLOSE SHOT - ANTI-MISSILE MISSILES being raised, fired. CLOSE SHOT - MILITARY TECHNICIAN in Omaha Situation Room. He is monitoring anti-missiles as they head for incoming missiles. Radio transmissions again: "...two minutes thirty to initial intercept. Tracking is...ninety seconds to initial... PROCESS SHOT - ANTI-MISSILES IN SPACE showing anti-missiles zeroing in on the much larger alien missiles. SOUND OFF. WE SEE some of the small missiles about to hit the larger ones. MED. SHOT - MILITARY TECHNICIANS at consoles. CAMERA PANS TO WALL MAP showing small blips conjoining with the large ones6 SOUND SUDDENLY. "Abort antis ... repeat abort.... configuration..." MED. SHOT - MILITARY TECHNICIANS They frown at one another, one shrugs. SOUND: another VOICE, "Impact... Impact... score mounting. Impact on thirty percent of incoming ... now fifty-one point six. Impact.." PROCESS SHOT - MISSILES COLLIDING MED. SHOT - MILITARY TECHNICIANS as they hear the transmissions, their expression of nonunderstanding turns to one of panic. SOUND: Initial VOICE, "Abort firings. Missiles do not conform to nuclear-configurations. Repeat, abort firings. Do not intercept. Non-nuclear attack underway ... Repeat, non-nuclear attack underway. PROCESS SHOT - MISSILES EXPLODING Color of explosions should be geared to the color of water in the plaza fountain, which is perhaps illuminated by CAMERA orange and red and yellow spots under the water. IMAGE BLURS at explosion. CAMERA MOVES DOWNWARD from explosion, picking up earth far below, keeps going down more and more rapidly, finally BLURRING In speed. VERY HIGH SHOT - SHOPPING CENTER CAMERA is still going DOWN, less rapidly. This SHOT seems to follow out of preceding one. At first, we SEE the shopping center, then SHOT CENTERS at the sidewalk In front of a single store. It is a Saturday afternoon, hundreds of people milling about, many oars moving. SHOT-finally NARROWS down on a single man walking out of store. CAMERA MOVES TO CLOSE SHOT. Man looks vaguely troubled, then panicked, grabs his eyes, his head CAMERA MOVES IN for a VERY CLOSE SHOT of his face, then his mouth alone as he opens It to give a blood curdling HOWL of agony and fear. VERY CLOSE SHOT - CAR STRIKING POLE The driver is dead or dying. His car veers crazily into another car, ends up striking pole. TV ANNOUNCER - IN THE CLEAR MATTHIAS MATTHIAS ... the entire Los Angeles area. Already, hospital facilities have begun to crack under the strain and Civil Defense authorities state that the situation is much the same... MED. SHOT - TV SCREEN - IN THE CLEAR - MATTHIAS from between heads of two people watching TV. We watch the screen and then, as fragment of news reporter's story is cut off, CAMERA REVERSES showing people watching are dead, eyes, mouths open. MATTHIAS ... across the entire country. Martial law is now nation-wide. Whether a state of war between China and Russia -still exists is not important any longer. Our fellow countrymen are dying. The very foundations of civilization are beginning to crumble... CLOSE SHOT - RADIO It is a small transistor on a counter in a filling station. As CAMERA PULLS OUT showing station deserted, cars stopped here and there, a man and woman dead in a convertible at the gas pumps. ANNOUNCER ... CONELRAD channel. This is a class one emergency. All civilian traffic is barred from streets and highways. Stay in your homes... CLOSE SHOT - RADIO IN POLICE CAR We SEE the receiver, HEAR the emergency message as CAMERA PULLS BACK revealing a policeman lying, eyes open, across the steering wheel of the car. ANNOUNCER Those found without specific military orders are subject to summary execution ... Repeat This is a... LONG SHOT - DOWN A H0SPITAL CORRIDOR As the CAMERA PANS HALLS, WARDS, ETC., there are, here and there, a few bodies in the hallways, the beds are full. MED. CLOSE SHOT - IN THE CLEAR - NEVILLE IN LABORATORY Neville sits at his desk in white lab coat, sign on desk says COLONEL ROBERT NEVILLE. He is watching a small TV on his desk. MATTHIAS so now the question is survival. Is this the end of technological man? Is this the conclusion of all our yesterdays, the boasts of science, the superhuman conquests of space and time... the age of the wheel? Neville grimaces, shakes his head. At the end of next speech PHONE RINGS. MATTHIAS We were warned of judgment. Well, It's come now. This is the Judgement, the weeping and gnashing of teeth... Oh, God, where will it end...? CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE ON PHONE nodding, face set. NEVILLE Yes. Soits airborne bacteria. Let's try-vaccine 93-b-71. How the hell do I know? I don't... It might. Ill be there in an hour. NEVILLE RUNNING DOWN CORRIDORS with small satchel. NEVILLE ON AIRSTRIP running toward waiting helicopter. He wears fatigue coveralls. NEVILLE IN AIRBORNE HELICOPTER with satchel of vaccine in lap. PILOT next to-him. ZOOM SHOT - TO PILOT grabbing eyes, falling forward onto controls. HELICOPTER GOING DOWN Neville showing signs of illness too. HELICOPTER CRASHED Neville drags himself from wreck. Only one bottle of vaccine is unbroken. He injects himself, passes out. LAST TITLE FADE OUT. FADE IN: MED. LONG SHOT - INT. DARK TRAVEL AGENCY from rear of office. There are posters on the walls: "See Mexico." "Visit London," "TWA to Hong Kong," etc. Dust is over everything, the floors are filthy and-, littered with paper. CAMERA points out OPEN DOOR to street. Suddenly we SEE Neville FLASH by in his car. CUT TO: LONG BOOM SHOT - DOWN ANGLE ON EMPTY STREET from roof of building. In left F.G. WE SEE clothesline. Clothes hanging on it are bleached. have begun to fall apart. We HEAR in DISTANCE ' high-pitched ROAR of Neville's ENGINE. Then he races by in street below. CUT TO: MED. SHOT - DESERTED SCHOOL ROOM CAMERA points out OPEN WINDOWI- with a broken blind hanging alongside. In left frame, next window has Easter bunnies, eggs, etc. made by children. In right side of frame, teacher's desk with small flag, rotten apple. Again, SOUND of CAR, Neville passes outside. CUT TO: MED. SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR As he rounds corner, he sees things lying scattered in the street ahead. He tries to stop, but runs over them. CLOSE SHOT - TIRE GOING FLAT MED. SHOT - NEVILLE GETTING OUT OF CAR He is irritated, looks around as if seeking a filling station attendant in order to get tire fixed. Glances down. He has run over a broken steel box, with US Mint markings. Its torn hinges have shredded the tire, and the gold ingots it contained are scattered under the wheels. He glances across street. A Brink's truck sits crashed into a fire hydrant, its rear doors open, swinging useless in breeze. Mint boxes and gold bullion lying unguarded. MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE His expression is one of total disgust. He speaks sardonically. NEVILLE Why don't they keep the goddamn street clean. MED. SHOT - NEVILLE He unloads car, hangs gun over his back, puts a few grenades in his belt, lifts gas can. As he walks away from car, he muses. NEVILLE There was a Mercedes agency on Sunset. Or was it Wilshire? MED. LONG SHOT - NEVILLE WALKING Ahead is the agency. Windows are broken. A 230SL convertible sits in the showroom. Neville walks through the broken window, walks around car. NEVILLE The color's not right, but ... how long did you say it takes to get a new one from Germany...? He walks to another car. NEVILLE How about this one? One careful Pasadena driver in tennis shoes? What's her phone number? MED. SHOT - NEVILLE SERVICING CAR He has put in battery, gas, etc. He closes hood, gets in. Glances at watch. NEVILLE My God, is it that late? He guns the motor and drives out through the broken window. CUT TO: . WIDE ANGLE LONG SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR We see Neville speeding down an empty main thoroughfare, the car accelerating faster and faster. He makes an impossible turn, the car bottoming, righting itself, fishtailing, straightening out and zooming on. CUT TO: WIDE ANGLE SHOT - A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE A long DOWN SHOT, which shows the car reaching speeds of over a hundred miles an hour. CUT TO: VERY CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR This is HEAD ON. Nevilles concentration, his tension must show. He looks like a master-driver in the ultimate test of his career. Meanwhile, it is getting darker, closer to night. CUT TO: WIDE ANGLE LONG SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR CAMERA RUSHES IN as SHOT OPENS, to MED. SHOT of the car careening down a deserted street in absolute recklessness. As Neville nears the end of the street, he slightly sideswipes a car parked out from the curb. VERY CLOSE SHOT - TIRES AND LOWER SECTION OF CAR Tires squeal as Neville turns corner. CAMERA MOVES OUT TO MEDIUM SHOT as car rights itself and shoots away. MED. SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR The car lights are on now, and as Neville slows down, it is deep twilight. He turns into drive in front of a tall apartment building. CAMERA MOVES IN TO MED. CLOSE SHOT of Neville in car. He presses remote-control button and WE SEE garage door open ahead of him. CAMERA SWIEEPS to Neville's face. He shows relief, as if he has made, It through a very tough race indeed. MED. SHOT - DOWN ANGLE FROM BEHIND CAR As Neville guns motor and starts into garage, a figure detaches itself from growing darkness and leaps onto him. The figure seems simply to materialize) and it leaps high, landing almost in the car. Neville tries to fight back as the car drifts down the drive into garage. MED. SHOT - INT. GARAGE from within the garage. WE SEE the car drifting down the ramp into garage, Neville and the black-clad figure wrestle as the car, at low speed, crashes into a pillar or another car. Neville pushes the black figure away, hits him, hits him again, jumps from the car with his sten gun and fires a burst into the black figure. CAMERA RUSHES IN FOR CLOSE SHOT OF NEVILLE as he turns from the fallen figure. He looks outward at the still-open garage door, his face reflecting fear, horror. REVERSE SHOT - GARAGE DOOR AREA Two more black-clad figures are rushing in armed with clubs or spears. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE CAMERA JERKS as Neville fires his sten gun directly into LENS. Above the gun, his face is clenched in hatred, loathing. MED. SHOT - GARAGE DOOR AREA The door is lowering now. There is a body lying in a dark heap-just inside. WE can SEE one or two others scurrying away outside in the dark as the door closes4 MED. SHOT - NEVILLE He has lowered his gun, holds the remote-control box, pressing the button to lower the door. He is exhausted, shoulders slumped. He walks through the garage stopping to check a large gasoline-powered generator that has been jury-rigged to a panel to distribute current. There are shelves full of oil and batteries and similar supplies. He walks through the low-lighted garage. There are several rows of bright automobiles, sports cars, jeeps, a few pick-up trucks, a single armored car. All are kept in good condition, brightly polished. Neville walks back out into the open area of the garage, surveying the damage to the Mercedes, shaking his head. NEVILLE That's a shame. So hard to get a repairman these days, too. MED. SHOT - NEVILLE AT ELEVATOR Neville unlocks an elevator, gets in and pushes the button for the top floor. NEVILLE Penthouse, Robert. He's probably anxious to get on with the game. He leans back against the side of the elevator, eyes closed, exhausted, but still on the verge of laughter. NEVILLE Some game... CUT TO: LONG SHOT - ELEVATOR DOOR OPENING - NEVILLE The elevator opens directly into penthouse. Neville coming OUT into his fortress-apartment. In left F.G. of SHOT is silhouette of profile of what appears to be a man in a military--cap. Neville drops sten gun slowly to the floor, looks around room, his eyes light on figure. NEVILLE Okay, Okay, Im ready. CAMERA MOVES PAST SILHOUETTE, MOVES ACROSS LARGE ORNATE CHESSBOARD in middle F.G. to MED. SHOT on Neville-. He pulls off dirty shirt, tosses it aside, walks to his left. CAMERA STAYS ON HIM. NEVILLE Go ahead ... move. Neville walks into what seems another world, as CAMERA TURNS to FOLLOW HIM. It is a very long gallery-like room with many mahogany bookcases, walls covered with major paintings, pieces of sculpture here and there. He walks to a beautiful and ornate bar-liquor-cabinet, takes down a bottle of fine scotch. He pauses and studies the label as he twists off the cap. He speaks back over his shoulder. NEVILLE Why dont you have a belt? It might improve your game. He takes a long pull from the bottle, then moves on to the far end of the room where we can SEE a beautiful bed, armoire, old fashioned wash-basin, mirror, etc. These are perhaps screened off from the rest of the long gallery area by some bookcases set at right angles to the wall, forming a small chamber behind. CAMERA STAYS at ENTRANCE to SMALL CHAMBER. Neville rummages for a clean shirt, slips it on. NEVILLE But tonight you're going to lose. Luck over skill... CAMERA MOVES IN QUICKLY FOR CLOSE SHOT showing that beneath is sardonic humor, Nevilles loneliness and isolation tell on him. MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE He still carries glass, and is rummaging again, this time in a storage cabinet. It is white, antiseptic, very large. It contains a multitude of canned goods. Neville gets out a can of beans. He moves to stainless steel refrigerator, also large, gets out a summer sausage, and ice cubes and a chilled glass for scotch. NEVILLE You hear all that downstairs? I let sundown catch me out. So he took the gambit and threw away a few pawns. I was lucky... Neville opens can, cuts casing off one end of sausage. CAMERA moves OUT to MED. SHOT, showing this opposite end of apartment. It is as stark, barren and utilitarian as the other end is cultivated and civilized. In it are kitchen facilities, laboratory equipment, and a massive arsenal. (See Appendix for more on apartment) NEVILLE From time to time he gets nervous. He smells the end game coming... Neville is looking toward center of room as he talks. CAMERA MOVES BACK so as to place chessboard once more in middle F.G. Neville is walking toward board, scotch bottle and glass In one hand, beans (with spoon in can) in other. Summer sausage Is slang across his shoulder, held by string looped over finger of hand holding beans. He saunters to board, looks down studying situation. We now have time to SEE that the board, and its pieces, are both large and superb: a museum-quality set. NEVILLE But end games are fall of surprises, arent they? Ummm. My move, and discovered ... check! He puts down beans and sausage on edge of table, and moves knight, revealing check from his queen on opponent's king. Neville smiles and sits down. MED. SHOT - ACROSS BOARD - NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW We find that his partner is a bust of Caesar propped in the chair with an old and badly battered garrison cap on it. Cap bears eagle Insignia of colonel. CAMERA MOVES TO TWO SHOT. Neville studies board, absently presses a switch located under the table. After a moment, we HEAR MUSIC. It is Frankie Laine singing "We'll Be Together Again." RECORD No tears, no fears, we both have a lifetime before us... So what if we have to part, we'll be together again... Neville hits reject switch. Another tune, instrumental COMES ON. "Harlem Nocturne," Ted Heath's orchestra; alto sax solo. MED. SHOT -NEVILLE AT CHESS BOARD Neville makes a move on board. As he does, we HEAR NOISE, COMMOTION outside. Breaking glass, yells. Neville stands, studying board Intently. As the noise INCREASES, CAMERA MOVES to CLOSE SHOT of his FACE. His jaw tightens at he tries to Ignore the SOUNDS. ZACHARY (O.S.) Come out, Neville Neville sighs, smiles at bust. NEVILLE Excuse me, won't you. Just for a moment. He walks quietly to window, reaches down and picks up a Springfield 1903 rifle with a Sniperscope attached. He steps to the window. The windows are full-length and open onto a narrow balcony. All along the balcony rail, spaced every thirty feet or so, are floodlights pointed down into plaza in front of building. Neville has knocked out partitions between portions of balcony so as to have access to flood lights all along building. Down below In plaza or courtyard, there Is a large and brightly illuminated fountain, water bubbling In it, cascading from level to another. Neville stares out over darkened city. In far distance, perhaps a mile away, we SEE a fire start up, blaze higher. REVERSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S SILHOUETTE IN WINDOW NEVILLE They're at It again. Burning, wrecking. I wonder what tonight? A library? A laboratory? Maybe they've found the Museum of Fine Art. Goddamn those crazy bastards... MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE AT WINDOW He raises the rifle. LONG SHOT - INFRA-RED TELESCOPIC SHOT PANNING weird and unreal area outside range of floodlights. Passes a hunched, squatting figure. Stops, moves back Crosshairs glow as sight is given fine adjustment. IMAGE RECOILS as we HEAR REPEAT OF RIFLE. Figure slumps. MORE NOISE, CONFUSION, CRIES. MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE SHOT is across chessboard, through pieces from busts POINT OF VIEW. Neville is grinning sardonically. He raises the rifle in salute. NEVILLE Hall Caesar! And what do you suppose Brother Matthias is going to say about that? CUT TO: MED. LONG BOOM SHOT - NEVILLE AT TABLE SHOT is from outside window. CAMERA IMMEDIATELY PULLS BACK farther and farther until we SEE Neville's penthouse, a circle of brilliant light in an ocean of surrounding darkened buildings, no street lights. CAMERA HOLDS when penthouse is only a small glimmer of light. (Matte) DISSOLVE TO: CLOSE SHOT - FIRE IN FOG. Fire flickers as CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that it Is made 'up of burning books. CAMERA PANS titles: Molecular Biology, Astrophysics, etc. In B.G. we see many members of the Family systematically wrecking scientific and computer equipment. MATTHIAS (O.S.) Three? You're sure? Not three. ZACHARY (O.S.) Three, Brother. Two were inside the garage when he brought down the door, We heard the shooting. Then Joshua... CAMERA TURNS RIGHT, bringing Matthias INTO FRAME, CLOSE SHOT, head and shoulders. Matthias has dead-white hair, complexion, wears enormous sunglasses with reflecting lenses. MATTHIAS The light, you have to stay clear of the light... CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing Zachary. He Is like Matthias, white with sunglasses. But his hair Is natural and his features clearly African. Zachary speaks defensively. ZACHARY Brother, there wasn't no light... That cat hit Joshua in pitch black... MATTHIAS He cant see in the dark-...anymore than we can In the light. Zachary shrugs. ZACHARY Go tell him. Brother. He sees good enough, dark or light. Matthias walks in the glare of flames, wrecking continues In B.G. His dialogue is delivered sadly, reasonably at first. MATTHIAS one creature... caught in a place he can't stir from in the dark. One lone man... ZACHARY He aint a man, Brother. MATTHIAS No, no, you're right. But he is alone, outnumbered hundreds to one, with nothing to live for but memories ...nothing to live with but his gimmicks and gadgetry, his guns and ears...and yet the whole Family cant bring him down out of that...that... ZACHARY Pig-paradise, Brother? MED. CLOSE TWO SHOT - MATTHIAS AND ZACHARY Matthias smiles sadly. MATTHIAS Forget the old ways, Brother, the old hatreds, the old pains. The Family is one... Zachary nods, matching Matthias grin. ZACHARY Hog heaven, then... But Matthias is getting worked up. MATTHIAS Its not a joke, Brother. Remember the word! That thing, that Neville, is a creature of the wheel! He uses forbidden weapons, to6.ls! He has the power of Hell In those evil things! CLOSE SHOT - ZACHARY He is agitated, tired of hearing this. He has told them before that he can bring Neville down. He tries again. ZACHARY Well, let me put the power on him. Look... CAMERA FOLLOWS his pointing finger. In a glass-fronted refrigeration unit are flasks of nitroglycerin. CAMERA SNAPS BACK to ZACHARY. ZACHARY ...or there's cannons. I can go to the old Guard armory. I could get a rocket-launcher ... Just turn me loose... MED. SHOT - GROUP - MATTHIAS AND FAMILY We SEE that a group of five or six others who are like Matthias have gathered around while others continue destruction in B.G. The group mumble amongst themselves, shake their heads. Matthias answers him, as if he were explaining to a child. MATTHIAS Oh, yes, Brother, you could do that. Any one of us could. But if we did, The curse would begin once more, don't you see that? CLOSE SHOT - ZACHARY Zachary is sullen. ZACHARY I see that bastard living In the light like God whilst we rot and hide down here like grubs ... What do you reckon will happen if he hunts as out while We sleep? MED. GROUP SHOT MATTHIAS, ZACHARY, OTHERS MATTHIAS Put it out of mind, Brother. He will be destroyed. But not by guns and explosives. They are forbidden. They are never to be used again. When we have cleansed the word the flood of our righteousness will sweep it all away... As Matthias speaks he picks up a book and hurls it toward the fire, knocking elaborate glass structure down. MATTHIAS And Neville will be brought down... down to the Family and judgment. For blasphemy, for murder... As he speaks SLOW DISSOLVE from fire, grown larger now, engulfing whole building behind, to brightly lit top story of Neville's apartment.' VERY LONG SHOT TOP STORY OF NEVILLE'S APARTMENT FADE OUT FADE IN: MED. LONG SHOT - EMPTY STREET, EARLY MORNING The street is one of those with many apartment-hotels, etc., as on portions of Wilshire Blvd. SHOT is through trees, grass is tall in the-lawns, etc. We HEAR NOTHING at first but BIRDS. Then we HEAR the SOUND of someone RUNNING. CAMERA TURNS, finds a LONE FIGURE RUNNING TOWARD IT. SHOT. should be made INTO RISING SUN, sun rays refracted and diffused around dark silhouette of figure. MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE RUNNING He is in sweat suit, the shirt has JOHNS HOPKINS in large letters on front, his sten gun is on sling over shoulder, canteen and pouches in utility belt at waist. Flashlight, knife, etc. There is also a small tape recorder hung on belt. Neville continues to run, looking from time to time at numbers on buildings. At last he stops in front of a building, inspects it. He is breathing hard. NEVILLE ...And Big Bob Neville shakes off the last of the tacklers and scores with fifty thousand fans tearing up the stands... Another six for Hopkins...yea. Neville. He squats, pulls map from pouch, studies it, speaks into small tape-mike. CAMERA MOVES OUT FOR MED. LONG SHOT OF NEVILLE, down ANGLE from building POINT OF VIEW. NEVILLE This is 6306 Rimini Boulevard, sector two. The last six blocks have been clean. In the 5500 block, some signs they'd been foraging for food in a small drive-in grocery. (sardonically) You'd think prices would keep them in the super markets. MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE He unlimbers sten gun, checks it, sets it down, checks flashlight. Then he opens canteen, squats and drinks. Assumption is, it's whiskey. He gargles a little, spits it out, studies the building narrow-eyed. Talks into recorder. NEVILLE You've got to hand it to the bastards. They cover their tracks. It's been a damn year now. Drinks again, lets mike-hang, eyes distant in thoughts NEVILLE If I could find the nest, find where he stays thered be an end-run, and an end game, sure enough... He gets up, closes canteen, picks up equipment. NEVILLE But what would I do then...? CUT TO: SERIES OF SHOTS - NEVILLE SEARCHING He moves through dark corridors, into rooms. He is very efficient in his checking, spending only a few moments in each place. MED. SHOT - INT. ROOM Dark, dusty, light falling through half-closed blind. SHOT is ACROSS BED. Neville kicks open door, sees bed. There is someone or something apparently in it. Neville jerks back sheet, sten gun ready. CLOSE SHOT - CORPSE IN BED The body, left from plague-time, is not a skeleton, but simply a decayed and desiccated ruin, disgusting and piteous. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLETS REACTION He is sickened, his raised adrenaline draining away. MED. SHOT - NEVILLE IN BASEMENT He probes in comers, closets. Obviously is well practiced at this "search and destroy" technique. . MED. SHOT - NEVILLE IN OFFICE BUILDING He is moving. rapidly through offices, dust everywhere, files, etc. scattered. He always checks closets, etc. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE LOOKING DOWN His eyes narrow, he leans over and reaches down into wastebasket. REVERSE SHOT - UP ANGLE - NEVILLE ABOVE MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE He lifts up a sardine can, oil drips from it. Neville smiles viciously. CLOSE SHOT - WASTE BASKET In it are empty bottles, trash. It is not dusty or old looking. MED. SHOT - NEVILLE AT DOOR OF OFFICE Door is large, paneled. Obviously the entrance to very plush executive office. Neville puts ear against door, listens, stands back, kicks door open. LONG SHOT - OFFICE - PAST NEVILLETS SHOULDER It is paneled. drapes, dark furniture, thick carpets, etc. It is very long with a huge ornate desk at the far end. Behind the desk, sitting in a large high-backed swivel chair is a body. Neville studies the figure in the chair for a moment. The figure wears a hood, and it is this which keys Nevilles response. CAMERA DRIFTS DOWN ROOM toward figure. CAMERA now in Neville's POINT OF VIEW. CAMERA GLANCES FROM SIDE TO SIDE as it approaches figure, making sure there are no others lurking in corners. CAMERA STOPS on MED. SHOT, figure in chair, it stirs. NEVILLE (O.S.) All right, Dracula. Wake up. You've got company. Figure does not move. WE SEE BARREL of sten gun poked toward him from BOTTOM OF FRAME. We cannot see eyes of figure. NEVILLE (O.S.) Where's Matthias? Where does he stay? Figure does not move. MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE He shrugs, sighs. NEVILLE I always ask, and I always get the same answer (beat) Once more: where's the hive? Where does the king bee stay? MED. CLOSE SHOT - FIGURE IN CHAIR As Neville finishes speech, he pokes figure with barrel of gun. It falls forward, hood coming off. It Is dead and Disintegrating. SHOT HOLDS. We HEAR Neville's VOICE into tape recorder. NEVILLE (O.S.) 6806 Rimini Boulevard, sector two. Found another. Matthias' crowd is dying from the plague, one by one. Sweep continues. DISSOLVE TO: FADE IN: LONG SHOT - NEVILLE WALKING ALONG STREET He walks, one hand in pocket, a sten gun In the other, window-shopping. Some of the windows in the stores are broken. Behind others, the displays are askew, dusty. A liquor store Is almost demolished. He reaches an expensive looking clothing store, pauses, walks inside. Dialogue Is VOICE OVER. He palls off sweatshirt, drops it on floor. NEVILLE You dumb bastard, why did you ever bother to wash these things? Youre the only consumer left in town. CUT TO: MED. SHOT - NEVILLE IN MENIS CLOTHING DEPARTMENT He takes a garment from the rack, looks at it, drops it then frowns, picks it up and re-hangs it on the rack. He draws out a beautiful brocade tuxedo jacket, turns it, smiles, hangs it back. NEVILLE The Officers club is closed, isn't it? Permanent undress is the correct uniform. CUT TO: LONG SHOT - NEVILLE WALKING THROUGH DARKENED STORE Away from windows, it is shadowy in-the store, and we watch Neville walking, some clothes over his arm. SHOT is PAST HEAD AND SHOULDER OF A MANNIKIN. CUT TO: LONG SHOT - THE SAME - ANOTHER ANGLE Again POINT OF VIEW of a manikin -- as if those inert figures are watching Neville's progress past them. He seems unconcerned, but his sten gun is in his right hand. MED. LONG SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE THIS SHOT is from between the upraised arms of a manikin. CLOSE SHOT - FACE OF MALE MANIKIN CLOSE SHOT - ANOTHER MANIKIN CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S FACE He has stopped in relatively light portion of store. He is looking up, face filled almost with reverence. MED. UP ANGLE SHOT - FEMALE MANIKIN This manikin wears a very brief bikini. She is remarkably life-like. Her hips jut forward provocatively, her eyes point down toward Neville, and her long brown hair falls about her tanned shoulders. She wears the smallest of smiles. MED. SHOT - NEVILLE LOOKING UP AT MANIKIN This SHOT is past the head and shoulder of another manikin across the aisle from where Neville stands. It is as if his moment of passion and remembrance is overseen. MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE - SIDE VIEW He is I still looking upward. He puts out his hand to touch the almost-flesh of the manikin. Then, suddenly, there Is a small indefinite SOUND. He pauses, his jaw tightens. CAMERA RUSHES BACK TO MED. LONG SHOT as Neville whirls, sten gun up, clothing dropped. He is about to fire. MED. SHOT - GROUP OF MANNIKINS AND LISA These are female manikins including some with Negro features, In various dress, various poses. CAMERA FINDS LISA AMONG THEM, MOVES IN SUDDENLY TO MED. CLOSE SHOT. WE SEE the "manikins" mouth open In horror. MED. LONG SHOT - NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW - LISA Lisa turns suddenly and vanishes Into the shadows of the store. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE He is petrified. He cannot believe what he has seen. The gun hangs useless in his hand. He stands thus for's long moment, then, finding his voice, he calls after her. NEVILLE Wait...come back...wait... Youre real! Youre not... LONG SHOT - NEVILLE RUNNING THROUGH STORE Again, this SHOT is through a group of male manikins, well dressed, grinning at Neville as he runs. MED. LONG SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE - NEVILLE RUNNING He gets another glimpse of the girl as she runs out a side door of the store. MED. SHOT EXT. STORE This store is across the street from a large park. Neville pauses outside the store, looking up and down. CAMERA RUSHES BACK TO VERY LONG SHOT, still focussed on Neville. When CAMERA STOPS, the SHOT is FRAMED by the girl's hair and one shoulder. We do not see her face, but we can tell she is looking back at Neville from within the park. CAMERA ZOOMS IN on Neville again as he sees the girl. He begins running across the deserted street toward her. SEQUENCE OF SHOTS - NEVILLE RUNNING THROUGH PARK In none of these shots do we see the girl again. We see Neville running through trees, past a lake or stream; pausing to get his breath ' looking in all directions. He is almost frenzied. It has been almost two years since he has seen a normal human being alive -- much less a lovely girl. As the sequence ends, he is obviously exhausted. The shadows are much longer now. It is afternoon. MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE SEATED ON BENCH He sits, head down, his gun beside him. He is beginning to wonder if he has hallucinated the girl, if at last he is slipping toward insanity. NEVILLE Does it begin this way? Is two years alone too much? Then his head comes up. He has control again. NEVILLE No. you silly bastard, it doesn't begin this way, and two years alone is all right. The way it begins is asking yourself idiot questions. Now, let's find a drink before it's time to go home. He stands up, stretches, looks refreshed. DISSOLVE TO: CLOSE SHOT - CANDLE GUTTERING IN HOLDER CAMERA PULLS BACK, showing Neville in bar mirror. He drinks from glass, pours a little more from bottle, turns from-the bar. The room Is dark, light coming only from candle and from windows at front. The door is open. Neville, sten gun in left hand, drink in right, walks through tables, stands at door. Across the street is a federal court building. His eyes go up its height as CAMERA TURNS for LONG SHOT of BUILDING, Neville In RIGHT SIDE of FRAME. MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE BACK INSIDE He puts down empty glass, starts to pick 'up his equipment. Suddenly pauses as he HEARS a CRASH from a breaking bottle. His jaw tightens, he becomes tense and turns toward sound. CLOSE SHOT - WINE KEG DISPLAY Sign reads "Visit Our Wine Cellar -- For the Experience of a Lifetime" MED. SHOT - NEVILLE He squints at sigh, heads for the stairway with candle. MED, SHOT - NEVILLE GOING DOWN STAIRS WITH CANDLE MED. LONG SHOT - NEVILLE IN CELLAR This should be a spooky and generally tense atmosphere. The cellar, like much contemporary commercial architecture is made to look like an "authentic" wine cellar, and two years' dust and cobwebs have improved on art. SHOT is from BEHIND wine rack, over bottles, showing Neville at foot of steps, looking about cautiously. He puts candle on hogshead for general lighting, pulls out flashlight to examine MED. REVERSE SHOT - WINE RACKS, NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW MED. LONG DOWN SHOT - NEVILLE LOOKING AT WINE RACKS His flashlight probes here and there along walls. Stops on a. particular area of one of the racks. VERY CLOSE SHOT SIDE VIEW OF WINE BOTTLES IN RACK Neville's light falls on bottle. Behind rack we SEE another HAND at back. CAMERA HOLDS. The hand is still when light first strikes it, then it comes to life, moves, clenches. MEDIUM SHOT - BEHIND RACK OF BOTTLES We SEE a FAMILY MEMBER who has apparently been sleeping in cellar and has knocked wine bottle over in sleep. He comes awake fully as Neville enters cellar. NEVILLE - CLOSE SHOT From the shadows to his left rear. Also made from behind wine rack. CAMERA RISES from near floor level to five feet or so, following POINT OF VIEW of Family member. MED. WIDE ANGLE SHOT - WINE RACK From behind Neville. As he approaches rack, the entire Rack tilts and slowly falls toward him. MED. SHOT - NEVILLE throws himself back, trying to avoid the rack, but as he does so, he looks up. MED. CLOSE SHOT - UP ANGLE - CREATURE ON TOP OF WINE RACK hood flaring behind, arms outstretched CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S REACTION MED. SHOT - RACK FALLING ON NEVILLE bottles falling out of rack and exploding on floor. Creature jumps free from top of rack, MED. LONG SHOT - DOWN ANGLE FROM STAIRS Three more of the creatures pile-out from behind barrels, wine racks, wherever they've been sleeping. MED. SHOT NEVILLE UNCONSCIOUS UNDER WINE RACK CLOSE SHOT CREATURE'S FACE Shook as CAMERA SNAPS IN for very CLOSE SHOT: dead white face, Its mouth open, twisted with hatred and anger, eyes still obscured by hood. FADE OUT. SLOW FADE IN: As light begins to fill the SCREEN again, BLURRY, without FOCUS, WE HEAR, as from a great distance, TINY in sound, the VOICE of Matthias once more. He is preaching in away not much different from his last TV appearance in the credit montage. His voice has a peculiar mixture of the comforting and the sinister in it. As he goes on, his voice RISES, moves toward HYSTERIA. MATTHIAS- ...and, oh, brothers and sisters, I ask you to look at him. Does he have the Marks? Do you see them? (muffled answers of "no, no.") You see him as we were before the Punishment, before we gained grace. You see lying there, the last of scientists and bankers and business- men...the users of the wheel! Do we use the tools of the wheel, as he does? ("no, not.") Is he of The Family? ("no, not") Is he of the Sacred Society? (no, not.") Then ... what is he? (confused mumbling, anger) CAMERA CLEARS VERY SLOWLY TO AN UP SHOT NEVILLE's POINT OF VIEW WE SEE the vague image of someone in robes in a high pulpit, behind a high bench. CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY, APPEARING TO SEEK FOCUS. THEN IT SNAPS INTO FOCUS IN ZOOM - VERY CLOSE SHOT of large reflective sunglasses. It is Matthias. His hood is pushed back, and the rooms illumination is quite low. He seems to float in the darkness with candle-flames flickering around and behind him. LONG DOWN SHOT - NEVILLE TIED ON FLOOR MATTHIAS POINT OF VIEW Neville is regaining consciousness. CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY DOWN on him as Matthias talks. MATTHIAS (O.S.) He is part of the dead...he has no place here. He has the stink of oil and electric circuitry about him. He is obsolete... ( ...yes, yes.") WIDE ANGIE SHOT CHAMBER IN FEDERAL COURT BUILDING Its former function should still be evident, but it-now serves as the place where the Sacred Society governs the Family. It is courtroom, meetinghouse, church of the group. It is dark, hung with black cloth. The room is full of the hooded creatures that we have seen before. Only Matthias and perhaps half a dozen of his immediate followers do not wear hoods. Their hair and skin is dead white, their eyes are covered by an assortment of shields. MATTHIAS And what shall we do with old machinery...? ZOOM CLOSE SHOT - MATTHIAS - NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW He points at Neville. MATTHIAS ... you are discarded. You are the rubbish of the past... MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE His initial horror and fear past, he LAUGHS aloud. NEVILLE This is a bloody Halloween party... Youre all sick ... You need... Those nearest, knock him back down, silence him. MED. SHOT - MATTHIAS He smiles, shakes his head. His voice becomes soft with false compassion. He leans down over his pulpit. MATTHIAS How hard it is to admit the truth. (beat) Take him to the little room. For the Questioning... MED. SHOT - CREATURES DRAGGING NEVILLE CAMERA FOLLOWS as they take Neville into a smaller room. MED. LONG SHOT - THE LITTLE ROOM - MATTHIAS AND NEVILLE This room resembles the small chambers in which private questioning took place during the Inquisition. The table is long and there are candles and books on it. The scene should be Gothic and just this side of a put-on. Taste here, as elsewhere, must be exquisite so as to tread the line between the grotesque, the demented, and the Camp. MATTHIAS Well, now, Mr. Neville, we can talk for a little while. It's been a long time since you've talked -- except to yourself. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S REACTION Neville is surprised. He has assumed Matthias was truly and completely insane. NEVILLE So you dont rant all the time? Why bother with it at all? MED. SHOT - MATTHIAS He LAUGHS, walks around the dark room. MATTHIAS Yes, you were a scientist. The kind of man who understood nothing until there was almost nothing left to understand. NEVILLE (surly) I'm getting along... MATTHIAS You're getting dead, Mr. Neville -- or doctor or colonel, whatever they called you. I have responsibility for the last tiny remnant of mankind ... I have that responsibility. NEVILLE Then why the hell dont you live up to it? Why don't you throw away the costumes and get these people organized, try to work on a cure... Matthias turns on him angrily. MATTHIAS Oh. we are organized. You know that well enough. A cure? There is none. In the early days ... Have you seen the ruins of the general hospital? Thousands of bodies littering the corridors, rooms jammed with the dead ... and finally... those pitiful few who were left, hopeless, going mad, lynching the doctors, the technicians who had betrayed them... By the way, why weren't you there... Doctor? REACTION SHOT - NEVILLE NEVILLE I tried. There was a crash... TWO SHOT - MATTHIAS AND NEVILLE, MATTHIAS It doesn't matter. There was no cure. Is none. The curse you people created, couldn't stop, is... forever. So Ive turned that curse into a blessing. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S REACTION MATTHIAS (O.S.) No. now the Family has found its way. It can bear the burden -- the only curse left is -- you. NEVILLE You are insane. And before very damn long, youll be dead -- can't you see that? CLOSE SHOT - MATTHIAS MATTHIAS (angrily) last night you killed how many? Three of us? And today We don't know yet. And before that? You've killed dozens...Youre the messenger of death, Doctor, not us. TWO SHOT - NEVILLE AND MATTHIAS OTHERS come INTO the room now, and Matthias manner changes. Once again he adopts the portentous pose of judge-prophet. NEVILLE I was defending myself ... You lunatics came after me... MATTHIAS He's confessed all, Brothers. Murder, use of forbidden tools, practice of proscribed rites. He admits 'science, medicine, weapons, machines, electricity. He has not shared the Punishment; he does not bear the Marks... CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE NEVILLE What is the Punishment? The Marks? WIDE ANGLE GROUP SHOT - MATTHIAS AND GROUP OF FAMILY As Neville speaks, the group stares at him. This is the first group appearance of the Family. WE SEE that they are of both sexes and all races. Some seem fairly young, however there are no children. In addition to the hoods, we find some wearing goggles, some helmets with dark visors, etc. Obviously, all these forms of eye guards have been scavenged in the empty city. SERIES OF CLOSE SHOTS - INDIVIDUAL FAMILY MEMBERS As CAMERA PANS from one to another, each removes his or her glasses, goggles, etc. revealing blank white eyes. CAMERA completes pan, stops on Matthias. He removes glasses, shows his own white eyes. For the first time, WE SEE the OPAQUE EYES of the Family. MATTHIAS (quietly) These are the Marks, Mr. Neville ... The Punishment is what you and those like you brought upon us... CAMERA CLOSES on Matthias, closes slowly on his face, eyes, as he talks. MATTHIAS In the beginning, we tried to help one another, those that were left. We tried to clean things up, set them straight. We buried and burned. And it came to us that we were spared for just that work... PAN SHOT - FAMILY MEMBERS LISTENING TO MATTHIAS MATTHIAS (O.S.) ... to bury what was dead, to burn what was evil, dangerous... Neville's VOICE breaks in harsh, angry. NEVILLE (O.S.) So you burned libraries, laboratories...You wrecked computer centers, engineering facilities ... a herd of insane barbarians. Every night you go on burning. PAN SHOT ENDS ON MATTHIAS. He still speaks very quietly. MATTHIAS You call us barbarians, Neville'. Very well, it's an honorable name. We mean to cancel the world you made. We will simply erase history from the time that machinery and weapons began to threaten more than they offered. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE NEVILLE You'll play hell... CLOSE SHOT - MATTHIAS MATTHIAS No, you've played hell you and your dead kinsmen of the car and the plane and the tank and the bomb ... and when you die, the-last living reminder of hell will be gone ... forever. As he speaks, CAMERA PULLS OUT TO GROUP SHOT. The Family RS assent. Matthias turns to Zachary. MATTHIAS Brother Zachary? ZACHARY We got everything ready. MED. SHOT - EXT. - NEVILLE, MATTHIAS, ETC. An alley or narrow street. There, a cart has been brought. It has high sides and two solid wooden wheels about five feet in diameter. It is filled with old newspapers, books, files, broken pieces of wooden furniture, etc. SHOT is made BETWEEN Neville and Matthias. Matthias and Family have glasses or shields back on. Zachary comes over, jerks Neville roughly toward cart. Matthias stops him. MATTHIAS One thing, Neville, now that its over... Neville stares back at him. MATTHIAS why didn't you leave? Why didn't you get out of the city...? NEVILLE I wasnt sure about that ... until now. MED. LONG SHOT - NEVILLE IN CART On his head is a conical cap obviously made of computer printout paper. This scene echoes the burning of heretics. Again, if it is done tastefully, it will gather still another fragment of the past which haunts us. Neville is bound in the small cart. It is pulled by members of the Family. HOWLING members of the Family throw rubbish at him -- scientific debris -- and curse him. The cart is in the midst of a dense crowd, each member of which carries a candle. The lighting is weak, bizarre. CLOSE SHOT OF OLD WOMAN in hood, eyes opaque, LAUGHING insanely, throwing objects at Neville. CLOSE SHOT - HANDS trying to reach through the slats of the cart to scratch Neville. They are dead white. MED. CLOSE - NEVILLE over a wave of candles, the flames flickering Insanely. LONG SHOT - THE CROWD filling a narrow street from Neville's POINT OF VIEW. CAMERA TRANSITION TO NEVILLE who stands tied to the cart, wood and paper and books piled around him. CAMERA PULLS BACK to WIDE ANGLE LONG SHOT. We find that we are in a VAST EMPTY STADIUM. In the midst of the field, THE FAMILY, all carrying candles, are gathered around the stand from which Matthias preaches. The cart has been turned upside-down and the technological debris it contained is piled below one of the wheels, to which Neville Is bound, spread-eagled. It stands in a large circular burned area. This is where Matthias and the Family have burned bodies after the plague's onslaught. MED. LONG SHOT - MATTHIAS - NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW MATTHIAS Here Is evil... MATTHIAS past Neville's profile. As Matthias speaks, CAMERA FOCUS ALTERS FROM MATTHIAS to NEVILLE. MATTHIAS Is this not the place where all the dead burned? And this (pointing to Neville) Is the last of the dead...And what will we do with this corpse? As Matthias asks his question and the Family HOWLS for Nevilles death, CAMERA PULLS OUT VERY QUICKLY TO WIVZ ANGLE LONG SHOT as stadium LIGHTS COME 0N. At first flickeringly, then with a BURST of fall power. All the lights do not come on. Some bulbs ate burnt out or have failed over the past year or so, but still the field la flooded with light. MED. SHOT - MATTHIAS AND OTHERS OF THE SOCIETY falling back from their stand, trying to cover their eyes despite their sunglasses. MATTHIAS (surprised) What...? NED. LONG - CROWD SCENE Family members dropping their candles, falling, groping, trying to find a way out of the blazing arc lights. CLOSE SHOT - FAMILY MEMBER writhing on ground in agony. MATTHIAS (O S.) Find the switch, get those lights off...! Give us the darkness again! More dark ... more dark! NED. CLOSE - FAMILY MEMBER stumbling blindly toward sidelines of stadium. NED. CLOSE - FAMILY MEMBER trying to stab Neville, missing him In his blindness. WIDE ANGLE LONG SHOT - STADIUM Neville still staked out in center of stadium. Last of the creatures Is crawling or hobbling away out of the light. After a long moment the are-lights begin to fade, wink, and finally go out. CAMERA ZOOMS DOWN TO CLOSE SHOT of Neville struggling, trying to get loose. Then he pauses, fear in his expression, He HEARS someone COMING. NED. SHOT - BLURRED IMAGE OF SOMEONE MOVING ACROSS FIELD walking swiftly across the empty field, Neville tries to twist his head around to see, but it is too dark down in the bowl of the stadium to see more than a shadowy figure. CLOSE SHOT - HANDS UNTYING NEVILLE - SEMI-DARKNESS WE SEE HANDS quickly loosening the ropes on Neville's ankles and hands. MED. SHOT - NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW Shadow of someone above him. MED. SHOT'- NEVILLE FREEING SELF FROM ROPES He pulls loose from the last rope. NEVILLE Who are you? Dutch (O.S.) Shut up. Move, move, MOVE! Neville begins to run, pushed by the shadowy figure. SEQUENCE OF SHOTS: MED. CL0SE - NEVILLE running to edge of field. MED. LONG - NEVILLE AND FIGURE running into ramp area, disappearing under stands. MED SHOT - NEVILLE Figure behind him pushes him along in the darkness, giving him no pause. LONG SHOT MATTHIAS AND FAMILY RECOVERING FROM LIGHT Matthias and his people are re-grouped, looking for Neville. CLOSE SHOT - MATTHIAS MATTHIAS Find him. Search the Corridors... the storerooms...everywhere... CLOSE SHOT NEVILLE Figure behind pushes him through a door, slams it closed. Neville falls to his knees, shakes his head, trying to get his bearings. A beam of light from an electric torch sitting on a box dimly illuminates the room. He rises, starts to turn. Then, from shadows behind him, between lockers he HEARS: LISA (O.S.) All right, son of a bitch. Just hold tight... (beat) Uh-uh, dont turn. Stand. When I want you turned, Ill turn you. on or off or around. Lisas voice is low, smooth, sophisticated, but there is in It the sound of a profound self-confidence. MED. LONG SHOT - NEVILLE - REAR VIEW AGAINST LIGHT Lisa slowly drifts INTO FRAME LEFT. FOCUS is on Neville. Lisas head, right shoulder are blurred. Her hand comes up holding a .45 automatic. FOCUS MOVES TO GUN, Neville still In B.G. LISA Thats fine. Now put your hands out... way out, shoulder high. Like they were going to crucify you. CLOSE - NEVILLE looking AT CAMERA, his head and shoulders in LEFT HALF OF FRAME. In shadows behind, WE SEE LISA vaguely, the .45 VIVID in SHAFT OF LIGHT from torch. NEVILLE As a matter of fact, they were going to roast me. Why did you stop them? Lisa comes closer. We can SEE HER. She Is beautiful, and black. She Is wearing a shirt, tails tied, and long shorts, with cycle boots. Her face is composed, almost amused as she moves up behind Neville. LISA We've got a reason, Neville's eyebrows rise. He is setting himself to turn on her. NEVILLE My name is Robert... LISA Your name's mud, Mister. Neville whirls, CAMERA FOCUSES on Lisa who lifts the .45, brings it chopping down with moderate force. MED. TWO-SHOT - NEVILLE AND EISA Lisa is breathing a little harder, but her composure is fine. She cooks pistol. Neville is getting off floor staring into muzzle of .45, rubbing his head, looking at the girl with grudging respect. LISA ...and youre not going to need a name if you fool with me again. She nudges Neville toward the door. He raises his hands automatically. They walk. NEVILLE Where did you pick up that cute way of saying stop? WE SEE LISA still behind, looking from one side to the other as they traverse corridors. LISA Oakland. I was a Raider. Anyhow, I only said slow. You know how I say stop? The pistol nudges Neville's ribs. Neville keeps walking. NEVILLE You keep clowning around, and those spooks out there are going to... LISA Shut up. Dutch is taking care of the honks. LONG SHOT - FROM CORRIDOR OF STADIUM LOOKING OUT ONTO FIELD WE SEE MATTHIAS' PEOPLE running closer toward the corridor, This shot, we discover, Is from POINT OF VIEW of the shadowy figure, Dutch, who now stands in darkness. WE HEAR Dutch fumbling with something. CAMERA FOCUSES now on F.G. Dutchs hand rises, holding cylindrical container. Matthias' people still in B.G. reach corridor entrance. Dutch throws container. REVERSE SHOT - CORRIDOR FROM MATTHIAS' POINT OF VIEW As they try to enter, there is a blinding explosion of LIGHT, only moderate SOUND, as a phosphorus grenade explodes. SHOT should capitalize on diffusion, refraction of phosphorus blow-up, its brilliant blue-white glare. MATTHIAS No, no ... get back ... The next entrance... MEDIUM TWO SHOT - NEVILLE AND LISA Neville is in F.G., Lisa behind with pistol. They are trotting. LISA okay... stop, Open it up. They are standing near a utility room. Neville turns and sees her for the first time. NEVILLE Youre..! LISA Okay, you've seen me before. Pull it out buster ... move! Neville wheels out a small motorcycle, NEVILLE (admiringly) You plan ahead... LISA We plan every which a way. Now look, you're gonna ran this thing, but I'm the ramrod, you know? Neville says nothing, seating himself on the bike. LISA Do me a favor, will you? Don't screw up. I know how to roll, Out It's hard on the elbows ... and oh, yeah, If you just have to play James Bond, I'm gonna sift your brains All over the walls, Neville grins In spite of himself. NEVILLE Yes, ma'am... CAMERA PULLS BACK as he, starts cycle and they move OFF down shadowy corridors. LONG SHOT - MATTHIAS AND FAMILY IN CORRIDOR They tan along corridor, seeking Neville. SOUND of bike can be heard MED. CLOSE SHOT - CANISTER ROLLING INTO MATTHIAS' PATH As we see another grenade appear, we HEAR Alts laughter from side corridor. Grenade explodes, spurting burning phosphorus onto one of Family. CAMERA PULLS OUT to MED. SHOT as Family member SHRIEKS in pain. MATTHIAS Down the other way. We'll catch them at the main exit ... the ramp. SERIES OF SHOTS - NEVILLE AND LISA ON BIKE IN CORRIDORS Lisa yells directions to him as Neville skids bike around corners, in and bat, around obstacles like heaps of cushions, piles of coke cases, etc, Shot should take advantage of bike light, refractions, shadows, veering of bike, near collisions. LISA Left, left, goddamn It. (beat) Another leftand step on it. LONG SHOT - RAMP OF STADIUM Shot is from Dutchs POINT OF VIEW. CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing Dutch, standing about ten yards from ramp. He holds a grenade In each hand. It is still dark, but the first signs of pre-dawn are APPEARING. We HEAR the roar of the Family as they run inside the corridor toward ramp. As they APPEAR, Dutch lofts the first one and then the other grenade, tossing one on each side of the exit, leaving a narrow passage directly in the middle, free of the phosphorous, though bathed in blinding LIGHT. Matthias and Family fall back in confusion. We HEAR sound of bike over their yells, Dutchs laughter. MED. SHOT - NEVILLE AND LISA ON BIKE They skid around final corner. Neville hits brakes, Leaves rubber. REVERSE LONG SHOT - DOWN CORRIDOR, NEVILLVES POINT OF VIEW Matthias and his people, turned and blinded by burning phosphorus, HEAR Neville coming. CAM8RA ZOOMS to MED. CLOSE SHOT, Matthias. MATTHIAS He is coming ... There... MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE AND LISA ON BIKE LISA What the h6ll you stopped for? Hit It, you dumb honk! NEVILLE You want me to? Lisa prods him with the pistol. LISA Right on, you lump. They're blinded. Right on! Neville shrugs, races engine. NEVILLE Okay, baby, hitch up your drawers... He revs engine, kicks off straight toward Matthias and Family. LONG SHOT - MATTHIAS AND FAMILY NEVILLES POINT OF VIEW We see Matthias and the rest coming closer and closer as SOUND of bike becomes deafening Behind Family is burning phosphorus. Matthias Puts out his hands as If to wave Neville to a stop. MATTHIAS Stop them, stop them... FLASH CUT - CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S FACE.

His hair is long, and on the back of his jacket is painted the upraised red fist of revolution--with the middle finger extended. He is a tough cookie, but very bright indeed.

You've only seen the tertiary cases ... Were primary, you see. Neville is stunned. It simply has not occurred to him that the young people are also victims of the plague. DUTCH When it hit, the older people either died outright or went to the third stage pretty fast. You know: blindness in light, albinism, psychotic delusions, occasional stages of torpor: like Matthias and his gang. NEVILLE And you? DUTCH Some of the younger people had a kind of resistance. We...hold out. One or two of us are a little bit light sensitive, but otherwise all right. But Richie's going. He's advanced secondary. GROUP SHOT - AT DOOR OF BEDROOM A girl comes out. LISA How is he? GIRL (shaking head) No better. The color is gone from his skin, Lisa. Hesalmost white. Lisa shakes her head. LISA If he wasn't out of his head already, thatd really blow his mind.

SERIES OF SHOT - NEVILLE AND RICHIE He goes over Richie carefully, checking vital signs, blood pressure, reflexes, etc. DUTCH (O.S.) He could hold here for weeks and then come up one of Matthias' monsters--or he could go over in ten minutes. NEVILLE (still examining Richie) So they go through fever and delirium passing from your state to Matthias'? And then, At Matthias, they hold again. Indefinitely. CLOSE SHOT - DUTCH DUTCH I've seen them go over before. I almost got killed last summer by a friend. He went over without any warning. When I looked away. he was kind of pale and: his hair was going.

Other KIDS sit around reading, playing guitar, eating. NEVILLE We'll take him to my place. I've got most of what I need there. LISA (scornfully) Is there anything you can do, Doctor?

Look who gets left behind to play Noah after the flood. LISA Noah is up for grabs, Robert. Matthias is only a contender. CLOSE TWO - NEVILLE LOOKING UP NEVILLE UM...? Lisa smiles at him. CAMERA MOVES OUT to show Richie coming around. He looks up, suddenly terrified as he sees Neville. RICHIE (weakly) Hey... LISA Easy, baby. Its all right... RICHIE Where are we? Did they get us...? LISA Nobodys got us, Richie. You remember that place where there was light? The place where the creeps all came at night trying to bring it down? RICHIE Yeah, sure... LISA This is it. This is Neville. He's ...the landlord, I guess. (slyly) Richie eases back, somewhat reassured. RICHIE How sick is he? Lisa smiles sardonically at Neville. LISA He isnt hardly sick at all, honey. Maybe just a little spooked once in a while. He's going to get you well. RICHIE Well, hell. You know there aint no way... NEVILLE I'm going to try. What have you got-to loose? Richie smiles up at him. RICHIE Nothin' man. Not a thing. You go it, hear? LISA He will, baby. He will.

VERY CLOSE SHOT - LISAS FACE WE NOTICE that she is a little lighter than in past scenes. Streaking in her hair should now be somewhat noticeable. LISA But its a chance... MED. CLOSE - NEVILLE He looks up from microscope. NEVILLE Yeah, and it ought to be your chance. You need this stuff, too. TWO-SHOT LISA Not as bad as he does. And anyhow, he's my brother... Neville studies her a moment. NEVILLE That's why he is getting it first. (beat) And if it works, you understand what that should mean, don't you? Lisa looks puzzled. LISA What? NEVILLE Hell be the source of more antibodies. The more people we can inject, the more we'll have serum for...the others. And when thats done, we'll pull out. We'll take what we need, and head for the mountains and the valleys ... think of what's out there... MED. SHOT - LISA She is listening, but her expression shows that she is preoccupied with other thoughts. Neville has left workbench and walks across apartment. Lisa walks with him. They stop near liquor cabinet. NEVILLE (O.S.) A whole world. Vines, fields that will grow anything we want to plant. Streams full of fish again. Stands of timber... LISA You sound almost... NEVILLE Almost what? LISA Almost glad that it ... happened. CAMERA PULLS OUT TO TWO SHOT Neville pours a drink, mixes one for Lisa. He looks up coldly, almost angrily. NEVILLE I'm not glad, but Im not moaning, either. I told them in Biowar, you people are crazy. This kind of research... (breaks off) ...Ah, why do you think I was a colonel instead of a lieutenant general? LISA Now they know. NEVILLE No, they dont know a goddamned thing. They're dead. We know. (beat) Forget it. Its not worth our time. He takes off lab coat, climbs into coveralls, gets sten gun, belt with flashlight, grenades, etc. He cocks sten gun, checks pouch for ammo, checks flashlight. CLOSE - LISA LISA Where are you 'going? Dont you need some rest? CLOSE - NEVILLE NEVILLE This is the way I rest...Ill be back before sundown. Dont worry. LISA Robert... NEVILLE Later... CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE WAVING FROM ELEVATOR - LISA'S POV REVERSE SHOT - LISA She looks sad, subdued tears in her eyes. EXT. PLAZA - DAY empty and the fountain splashes untended. We SEE a small FIGURE on a bicycle pedaling across the far side of the open space. It is the child we met in the house with Al and Richie and the Others. She conceals her bicycle at the edge of the plaza and scurries fearfully across the open space to the fountain. On the edge of its lowest basin, she lays out a pitiful array of flowers and an apple or two from a paper shopping bag she carries. She crouches, kneeling with her hands clasped, hardly daring to look up at Neville's tower. GIRL Please...I brought you this stuff. Don't let them take me either, and put me in a bag. Please. She HEARS the SOUND of an ENGINE roaring closer and races terror-struck, for her bicycle. As she DISAPPEARS, Neville's car crosses the plaza at speed, slowing only enough for the garage doors to open and ENTER. The girl's offering lies unheeded on the fountain. VERY CLOSE HAND WITH HYPODERMIC NEEDLE CAMERA PULLS OUT TO MED. CLOSE - NEVILLE is injecting Richie with serum. The boy is unconscious, mumbling deliribusly. RICHIE ...got to move fast, keep on moving. That Matthias, he wants you. All the cops want' I you. They gonna get you, boy, they gonna make you come over, you hear? This dialogue in background while Neville and Lisa (who is O.S. in dressing room) talk. CAMERA PULLS OUT.TO MED. SHOT. INTERCUT CLOSE SHOT - LISA, looking in mirror at a streak of silver in her hair.

LISA He's all the brother Ive got, all the family...in this world. NEVILLE Don't sweat. This is his best chance. MED. SHOT - NEVILLE WALKING INTO MAIN APT. NEVILLE If there were time, I'd have trapped one of Matthias' things and tried the serum on it. Lisa bristles at this. LISA What do you mean "things Arent they human, too? NEVILLE Yeah ... I guess you could call them that. How many are there? Forty? ... Fifty? The last of those four billion steamy bodies that were crawling around last time somebody took a count. They were a dandy bunch weren't they? LISA They did the best they could. Who the hell are you to put down the human race? NEVILLE Me? I'm nobody, baby ... but at least I know it. I was just part of the crowd, and I didn't think much of it. LISA Well I do! They made the world...that's what it was all about. NEVILLE No, honey...they RUINED it ... we're living in what they made of it, and God help us. Pretty soon those sick animals out there'll be gone, and then we will be too and all that'll be left is this (points to his collection of cultural artifacts) That one Rembrandt's worth more than everyone left alive in this stinking city! Maybe in a hundred years or so Godll get around to kicking through the ashes down here and read Shakespeare and say, "Well ... maybe it was worth it." LISA I've heard that kind of talk before, you uppity, honky pig...and I HATE IT! NEVILLE Ohhh, lovely! Yeah ... I've heard THAT kind of talk before, too, and that got everybody a hell of a long way, didn't it? There're just about enough of us here to go through all that again, right? (more) NEVILLE (CONTID) You can found a Panther cell, and I can start up a White Citizens Council! Or shall I be the SDS and you can be the whole damn Harvard faculty?! Too bad we don't have enough folks around to do the United Nations over, isn't it! CLOSE - LISA She is boiling, but holds her control. She speaks quietly, matter-of-factly. LISA Neville, you are a bastard. A class-A bastard. MED. SHOT - LISA WALKING TOWARD DOOR NEVILLE (O.S.) Where are you headed? Lisa stops, turns. LISA I know it doesn't mean much to you, but it happens this is an anniversary. Two years ago today, all those no-good people you just wrote off, died in this town. I've got a mother and father Richie and I buried with our own hands out there, after the Army stopped burning the bodies. Id like to go visit them, if it's all right with you! Neville studies her for a long moment. NEVILLE Sure, it's all right. He tosses her something below CAMERA RANGE as he speaks. NEVILLE Take this with you.

CAMERA PULLS OUT TO MED. SHOT. She is walking along a path with grass grown up on both sides. CAMERA PULLS OUT TO LONG SHOT, DOWN ANGLE. WE SEE now that she is walking in a cemetery. The graves are overgrown, some of the stones fallen. The place is in general disrepair. MED. SHOT - LISA AND GRAVE She pushes aside some tall weeds and stands before a place relatively cleared, where someone has put gravel to keep down the weeds and has carefully outlined a large grave-site with coke and seven-up bottles by burying them in the ground neckdown. There is a faded plaque of wood, probably the bottom of an orange-crate or something more substantial. On it are the names and dates of her parents: Richard and Lorena McNally Born, Montgomery, Alabama Died, Los Angeles, California 1977 In front of the marker are a couple of tin coffee cans with the remains of long-wilted flowers in them. VERY CLOSE LISAS FACE She stands for a moment, silent, near tears. Then she speaks in a low, almost conversational tone. LISA Listen, I know I don't come like I should. But it's hard times, momma, daddy. You never knew what hard times was. You only thought you did. Suddenly, above her monologue, she HEARS a SOUND. A SOB. It .is not the sound of an animal, but a human sound, She whirls, a copy of Neville, the sten gun she is carrying ready to fire. She cocks it as she turns, and her face is hard. She sees nothing. MED. LONG SHOT - CRYPT LISAS POV Perhaps some thirty meters away through the weeds and grass, she sees a crypt. It, too, is overgrown with moss, ivy, and has not been cared for. CLOSE - LISA She slowly approaches crypt, gun ready, a little on edge, curious. VOICE (O.S.) Oh, God ... oh... Lisa stops as she HEARS this MOAN, then moves cautiously around to front of crypt. The door is ajar slightly. Again, like Neville, after a pause, she kicks door OPEN, jumps past it, glancing inside. MED.

VERY CLOSE LISAS FACE Her expression is one of astonishment, utter sorrow. MED. SHOT - WOMAN KNEELING IN CRYPT LISAS POV The woman, a hood over her head and shoulders like a shawl, kneels beside a tiny body laid out on rags. Her fingers touch its leg or arm. She faces the body as SHOT OPENS. Then she turns very slowly to her left, looks up at Lisa from the deep shadows. MED. CLOSE - WOMANIS FACE - SLIGHT DOWN ANGLE Her face is dead white, white hair straggled around it. Her eyes are the blank white of all Matthias' people. And there are tears running down her cheeks.

CLOSE REVERSE SHOT - LISA - SLIGHT UP ANGLE The gun falls to her side. She stands for a moment watching the woman. LISA I'm ... sorry... MED.

He enjoys watching it. SOUND OF CAR approaching in near distance. MED. SHOT - LISA IN CAR THE SHOT IS PAST NEVILLE IN F.G. Lisa pulls UP, parks the car, and gets out slowly, carrying her gun listlessly. She is absorbed in thought, stops a little behind Neville on the far side of fountain. She wears sunglasses and a scarf though it is not bright. Her hair has a few subtle streaks in it and her skin has lightened also. Neville has glanced at the car as it arrived, is now turned back to fountain. NEVILLE It's an illusion, you know. It looks like a tapped spring, but theres nothing new ... the same water coming up over and over again... Lisa says nothing. NEVILLE He's better. His skins a little darker; I cant tell about his eyes yet. MED. SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE Lisa is restless. She walks around fountain, looks through at Neville from the far side.

I didnt do a goddamned thing but look and choke and run. MED. CLOSE - NEVILLE THROUGH FOUNTAIN - LISAS POV He looks puzzled at her angry response. As she continues, his expression changes to one of compassion. LISA (O.S.) Because one of them was a dead baby Stillborn, like all of them. And the other one was its mother.

Neville stands in corridor, next to door, back against the wall. He cannot see inside. CLOSE - NEVILLE He is sweating now. In the darkness he cannot handle himself as well as in the lights. He swings his penlight inside, looks around quickly. He sees nothing but the table and a few smoking candle stabs on It. He hears a sound, a scuttling, as If someone were tip toeing from one place to another. Neville palls a concussion grenade out of his satchel, pulls the pin with his teeth, holds it in his left hand. He turns, tosses the grenade into the room and covers his ears. The EXPLOSION is deafening, sounding down the corridors. SEQUENCE OF FLASH CUTS: This is very brief - DARKENED HALLWAYS AND CORRIDORS as the booming SOUND of the EXPLOSION moves along them. MED. CLOSE - NEVILLE From Inside room where grenade has gone off. In the dim light, bluish smoke drifts. We SEE NEVILLE at edge of door. NEVILLE Well, Matthias don't you have anything to say? There Is silence.

He whirls, shoots. REVERSE SHOT - CREATURE FALLING This SHOT is from beyond the creature who has tried to kill Neville. Neville is in far B.G., sten gun aimed at the creature. The creature lies on the pavement, bleeding, twitching. CAMERA HOLDS as Neville begins running again, this time directly TOWARD CAMERA, running over the body of the thing he has killed. LONG DOWN SHOT - NEVILLE RUNNING We see him running from VANTAGE POINT above the street. He is about a half-block from the apartment. We see his APT. from this VANTAGE POINT ALSO. We see SEVERAL of the FAMILY in the street running toward Neville. He FIRES, still running. Cuts them down. MED. WIDE-ANGLE SHOT - PLAZA - NEVILLE'S POV He stands before the apt. The fountain is running, floodlights on. He is dog-tired, but relieved. He smiles and walks carefully INTO PLAZA, glancing at the shrubs and shadows.

His eyes are closed. MED. SHOT - ELEVATOR DOOR SHOT is across int. of apt. It is dark. One candle is lit on chess table. This candle is in left F.G., VERY CLOSE FOCUS on candle as SHOT OPENS. As elevator door opens, FOCUS SHIFTS TO DOOR. Neville steps out. CAMERA CLOSES TO CLOSE SHOT. He frowns. Why is the apartment dark, bathed by glow of floodlights and a single candle? NEVILLE Lisa ... Lisa... Lisas voice is strange and distant, and odd quality in It as if it were being heard through water. LISA (O.S.) Yes...Robert... Neville relaxes, puts down his gun. He walks a step or two toward the SOUND of her VOICE - by the draperies, now pulled to cover the balcony windows. NEVILLE Richie ... went to Matthias ... he's... MED. SHOT - SILHOUETTE OF LISA - NEVILLE'S POV We see her standing, three-quarter-rear view. She is illuminated by very weak, bluish light of outside floods coming through draperies. Her VOICE still has that peculiar mechanical SOUND. LISA Yes, Robert ... I...know... NEVILLE (O.S.) You know?...How...? CAMERA.MOVES IN FOR EXTREME CLOSE SHOT ON LISA. As CAMERA CLOSES, she turns so that her face is now illuminated by the -candle. When SHOT completes, Lisa stands revealed. Her hair is white, face deadly pale, eyes completely blank.

WIDE ANGLE SHOT - LISA AND FAMILY SHOT is from behind Neville so that his back is the central POINT IN FRAME. Lisa moves closer to circle of light from candle, and from all sides, so do members of the Family. Matthias stands next to Lisa. MATTHIAS (mocking tone) Come In, Neville... (laughs) That sounds strange, doesnt it? Come In, Neville. He LAUGHS. Others grab Neville. MED. SHOT - NEVILLE He Is dragged to chair at chess table. MATTHIAS (O.S.) I thought we might arrange a little entertainment before time for...concluding our business. All right, brothers SEQUENCE OF SCENES - DESTRUCTION OF APARTMENT The Family, free at last to revenge itself, destroys Neville's treasures, SHOTS of books torn down, ripped apart, paintings SLASHED, sculpture SMASHSD, furniture BROKEN, wine-cabinet SMASHED -- his scientific equipment, his cabinets of food, his arsenal are WRECKED AND DESTROYED. It is as if the remote past has come forth to revenge itself on civilization. At the end of the sequence, se SEE some of the FAMILY setting FIRE to the draperies, the books, the kindling left of furniture. One of the creatures begins to SMASH the lense of the balcony floodlights. During this sequence, Matthias VOICE COMES OVER MATTHIAS (O.S.) We waited for you, Neville. So you could see this the end of everything youve done. You see? None of it was real. It was a dream. Your art, your scienceit was all a nightmare. And now its doneits finished. The SHOT SURVEYS ruined apartment, burned books, slashed paintings, wrecked scientific equipment -- the bust of Caesar smashed, deserves a CLOSE SHOT. CLOSE NEVILLES FACE - REACTION SHOT ACROSS CHESS.PIECES He has lost, In the space of a few hours, a surrogate son, a woman, and all the treasures he so painstakingly saved from the wreak of this civilization. Everything except the blood with which to make more serum. MED. CLOSE SHOT - MATTHIAS - PROFILE SHOT watching the conclusion of the destruction, smiling. Lisa stands in B.G., listless, paying no attention. He speaks to the family. MATTHIAS Brothers and sisters, our task is nearly complete He is the last of those who brought the Punishment to us. We have cleansed, rolled away his World. We go back now to a good time. We will build... CLOSE - NEVILLE cuts in loudly. NEVILLE Coffins Matthias. Build coffins. That's all you're going to need CLOSE - MATTHIAS pauses, stung. MATTHIAS Bring Mr. Neville along. MED. CLOSE - NEVILLE As the creatures start to walk toward elevator, he breaks free, dives away from them into what is left of his arsenal section of apartment. He clubs first creature with the butt of a broken rifle, throws it at the next. He grabs up a Pistol, fires point blank at two more. Matthias comes at him, a knife raised. The pistol is empty. Neville dodges Matthias, skirts toward center of room. Matthias following. Neville reaches down, lifts the head of the broken bust of Caesar, throws it at Matthias, knocks him down and out.

Lisa neither resists, or helps. Neville grabs up the broken rifle. MED.SHOT - INT. - GARAGE NEVILLE S POINT OF VIEW Lisa tries to speak in her peculiar new voice. LISA Robert... NEVILLE Shhh CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Neville and Lisa in F.G. in darkness of garage. In B.G. we SEE, up the ramp, brightly-lighted plaza area.

CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE Behind him, he hears the elevator starting-up again. NEVILLE Hell, I should have wrecked it. LISA (O.S.) Robert... CLOSE TWO SHOT - NEVILLE AND LISA In the B.G., beyond the lights of the plaza, we see the sky Is beginning to lighten.

As he bolts forward, he pulls Lisa along with him. NEVILLE Now, Lisa, now! MED. LONG SHOT - EXT. PLAZA - LISA AND NEVILLE RUNNING As Neville and Lisa come up out of the garage we SEE the Family beginning to drift away at the edges of the floodlights as the first signs of dawn begin to show. Sound of truck, previously very faint almost subaural, now becomes a little louder. Neville Is obviously pulling Lisa, while she does not resist him, does not cooperate. They slow down in middle of the Plaza, near the fountain, awaiting truck. MATTHIAS (O.S.) Lisa. His voice is soft, almost caressing. It is the same voice in which he addressed Richie before stabbing him. MED. CLOSE SHOT - LISA AND NEVILLE They look back and up--toward balcony of Neville's apartment. VERY CLOSE SHOT LISA She recognizes Matthias voice. Her face, expressionless, wrapt, gazes upward, seeing him. We hear sound of truck in distance. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE He stares up, trying to spot Matthias. His hands work bolt of broken rifle. REVRSE UP ANGLE SHOT - MATTHIAS ON BALCONY - NEVILLE'S POV This Is a SLOW ZOOM SHOT. Matthias stands on balcony In area between floodlights broken out earlier as Family member Wrecked apartment. He leans over balcony outlined against lurid red glow of fire in apartment behind.

CLOSE SHOT - SPEAR INTO CAMERA CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE The spear strikes him In chest. He falls backward into fountain, the bottle of plasma falling from his coverall.

Now we can sleep in peace. MED. CLOSE - NEVILLE He has fallen against pillar In center of fountain, bleeding profusely, but still alive. Then he HEARS A VOICE O.S. LISA (O.S.) Robert...Robert...

CLOSE - NEVILLE His head Is back as the sun strikes the fountain. His eyes are open. When the sun reaches his face, his eyes do not blink. He is dead still, we HEAR Lisas voice going on and on. LISA (O.S.) have to have The Family, Robert, do you understand? You understand, don't you, Robert? We HEAR SOUND of GENERATOR, which has been In B.G. all during this sequence. It COUGHS, CUTS OUT, COMES.BACK ON. LONG SHOT - DOWN ANGLE - PLAZA WITH FOUNTAIN CENTERED Neville is motionless In center. Lisa flits along the edge of the receding shadow as the sun eats away the area. She retreats back toward the smoking building. LISA (O.S.) The Family is everything, Robert ...I came back to the ... Family... Her voice gets more and more distant as It FADES completely. CLOSE SHOT - TOP OF FOUNTAIN Again we HEAR GENERATOR CUT OUTO COUGH, COME ON, AND STOP.

One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest 

 

EXT. WORK FARM - NIGHTFALL

All we SEE is an ELEVATED SHOT of the distant mountains,
rolling landscape and McMURPHY -- one cheek laid-open and
crusted over with dried blood, his face and prison work
clothes caked with dried sweat and dust -- as he sits on the
very top of a water tower watching the last rays of sunlight.

A long moment passes before McMurphy's attention is drawn
elsewhere and he looks down.

REVERSE SHOT - McMURPHY'S POV

Far below, in the prison yard a MAN is SEEN hurrying acrcss
the yard where he joins a group of men composed of armed
prison guards, officials, and medics -- a stretcher, an
ambulance, a fire truck and safety nets spread out at the
base of the water tower. The man is seen talking to the
officials, then a bullhorn is handed to him and they all look
up at McMurphy.

McMURPHY

As he looks down at them, a searchlight is turned on him.

			MAN (V.O.)
		(through bullhorn)
	McMurphy! This is Doctor Shankle,
	from the infirmary. Can you hear
	me?

McMurphy doesn't respond.

			SHANKLE (V.O.)
		(through bullhorn)
	Can you hear me, McMurphy?

McMurphy doesn't respond. Another searchlight goes on as a
SECOND VOICE is PICKED UP on the BULLHORN.

			SECOND VOICE
		(through bullhorn)
	Why don't we blast 'im, for Christ
	sake, he ain't gonna come down...
	you...

The BULLHORN is TURNED OFF. A long moment passes as McMurphy
continues to squat on the tower and wait. He shivers against
the coming night when...

			SHANKLE (V.O.)
		(through bullhorn)
	McMurphy!
	I have the warden's promise. If you
	come down, nobody will hurt you!
	You'll be in my custody! I promise!

An imperceptible smile appears on McMurphy's face.

INT. MEN'S DORM - OREGON STATE HOSPITAL - DAWN

Strange HUMMING SOUNDS, CLANKING PIPES and HISSING RADIATORS
as we see beds, with patients lying asleep, line two walls.
The third wall is a heavy gauge steel grill, with a door that
opens on to the day room. The door is open. On the far side
of the day room, a long hallway with other doors opening into
rooms: the latrine, washroom, tub room, mess hall, seclusion
room, psychiatrist's office, visitors' room, etc.

Across the day room, a glass enclosed nurses' station where
TURKLE, a Negro night attendant, is seen preparing to go off
duty.

The CAMERA PANS the beds in the men's dorm. One man turns,
another twists, a third lies as if dead.

CAMERA PAN ENDS on BROMDEN, who lies still, eyes wide open,
very alert. He reaches down, plucks a stale piece of gum from
under the bed frame, puts it in his mouth and starts chewing.

A beat, then Bromden carefully undoes the leather strap which
binds him to the bed. He slips out of bed and quietly makes
his way down the aisle, paying no attention to the other
patients, some of who are beginning to stir awake.

Ahead, at the end of the hallway, the door opens and three
Negro day attendants, WASHINGTON, WARREN and MILLER, dressed
in white uniforms, enter and move down the hallway and
disappear into a side room.

Bromden continues his silent journey towards the day room as
Turkle emerges from the side door to the nurses' lounge, goes
up the hallway as MISS PILBOW, the day nurse, comes in,
passing Turkle on the way out. She crosses to the nurses'
station and enters as Bromden reaches the day room.

INT. DAY ROOM - DAY

as Bromden makes his way across the day room, past the
nurses' station, unnoticed by Miss Pilbow who is busy
preparing the day's medication.

Bromden is sliding along the hallway wall, when he is
suddenly cut off by a mop which THUDS against one side of his
neck. A second mop yokes him on the other side. Bromden
freezes. Terrified.

			MILLER
	Where you goin', Chief?

			WARREN
	You goin' t'see the Big White
	Fathuh?

			WASHINGTON
	He goin' t'see the Big White
	Muthuh...

They cackle, legs jiving, as the ammonia stings Bromden's
eyes and burns his nose. He tries to twist his head, but
Washington jams the mop harder. Bromden freezes, panic
spreading across his face.

			WASHINGTON (CONT'D)
	Haw, look at 'im, big 'nough to eat
	apples off my head an' he mine me
	like a baby...

A KEY is HEARD hitting the lock in the main door. Washington
very adroitly releases Bromden, hands him the mop, and turns,
along with Warren and Miller, to their duties, as BIG NURSE
enters the ward.

			THREE ATTENDANTS
		(simultaneously, as Big
		Nurse passes)
	Mornin', Miss Ratched...

			BIG NURSE
	Good morning, boys.

She sweeps by and disappears into the nurses' station. The
three attendants put their mops and rags aside and start
towards the men's dorm, leaving Bromden pressed against the
wall, mop in hand.

INT. NURSES' STATION

as Big Nurse enters to be greeted by Miss Pilbow, who wears
an enormous cross between her breasts.

			MISS PILBOW
	Good morning, Miss Ratched. It's a
	beautiful day, isn't it?

			BIG NURSE
	Mean old Monday, Miss Pilbow, mean
	old Monday...
		(she flips on the
		intercom)
	Good morning, boys. Rise and shine.
	Rise and shine.

INT. MEN'S DORM - DAY

as Washington, Warren and Miller roust the patients out of
bed.

			BIG NURSE (V.O.)
		(through loudspeaker)
	Time to get up! Come on now, it's a
	beautiful day! Let's not straggle!
	Everybody up, up, up!

The Chronics are physically helped out of bed as the Acutes,
who can handle themselves, cross out into the Day Room,
rubbing the sleep out of their eyes. Big Nurse steps out of
the Nurses' Station. Washington and Warren are hustling the
patients toward the washroom.

Miller stays behind, stripping Blastic's bed and rolling up
his mattress.

INT. DAY ROOM - DAY

as the Acutes straggle past Big Nurse.

			BIG NURSE
	Good morning, Mister Sefelt... Good
	morning, Mister Fredrickson. Good
	morning, Billy, I spoke to your
	mother last night and she sends her
	love... Good morning, Mister
	Harding... Good morning, Mister
	Cheswick. Mister Scanlon...

Bromden comes drifting by, going in the opposite direction.
Big Nurse takes his hand and reaches up and pats his face.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Oh, Mister Bromden...
		(calling out)
	Mister Washington!

Washington comes running.

			WASHINGTON
	Yes, Miss Ratched?

			BIG NURSE
	Mister Washington, why don't we get
	a good head start on the day by
	shaving Mister Bromden and see if
	we can't avoid a disturbance.

			WASHINGTON
		(taking Bromden by the
		hand)
	Yes, Miss Ratched...

INT. WASHROOM - DAY

The patients are busy washing and shaving.

Warren is assisting a vegetable wash himself as Washington
guides Bromden through a cage-like partition... where an
antique barber chair stands.

			WASHINGTON
		(calling as he goes)
	Warren!

He sits Bromden down and straps his bands and legs in, then
plugs the electric shaver in and turns it on and brings the
BUZZING instrument towards Bromden's face. Bromden turns
away.

			WASHINGTON (CONT'D)
		(shouting out)
	Get your black ass in here!

Warren props the vegetable up against the sink.

			WARREN
	Tha's it... be right back!

Warren leaves; the old man starts sliding.

					QUICK CUT TO:

BROMDEN

as Warren enters and takes a firm grip on Bromden's head and
Washington goes to work on Bromden's face. CAMERA PUSHES INTO
EXTREME CLOSEUP of Bromden's fearfully distorted face as the
BUZZING SOUND of the electric razor INTENSIFIES until it is
INSUPPORTABLE.

					QUICK CUT TO:

INT. DAY ROOM - DAY

No sound as we SEE Big Nurse watch the last few patients file
past the side door to the Nurses' Station where Miss Pilbow
hands out little cups with pills. Washington stands by,
checking to see each man takes his pills before filling their
cups with orange juice.
The last patient takes his pills and returns to his place in
the Day Room. Miss Pilbow closes the window.

Satisfied that all is well, Big Nurse turns on an old 45
record player with a stack of records, then she settles down
to her work as a SOFT, NOSTALGIC NUMBER from the '40's is
HEARD OVER LOUDSPEAKER. CAMERA BEGINS SLOW PAN of the Day
Room.

The patients, under the influence of drugs, have settled down
for the day. HARDING is playing cards with MARTINI, CHESWICK
and BILLY. SEFELT and FREDRICKSON are putting a jigsaw puzzle
together in brotherly love. SORENSEN is off by himself,
rubbing his hands clean. TABER, pencil in hand, sits
pondering over a blank piece of paper. SCANLON paces back and
forth. On the Chronics' side of the room, RUCKLY is turning a
grimy photograph over in his hands. BANCINI sits wagging his
head, mumbling over and over, "Tired, awful tired..." ELLIS
stands against the wall, arms outstretched, hands nailed to
the wall by imaginary nails.

Bromden is pushing a mop around. 

Washington, Warren and Miller are in the men's dorm making up
the Chronics' beds when O.S. the TELEPHONE RINGS.

					CUT TO:

INT. NURSES' STATION - DAY

as Miss Pilbow picks up the phone.

			MISS PILBOW
	Eighty-two, Miss Pilbow speaking...
	Yes...
		(she makes a note and
		hangs it)
	... New admission, Miss Ratched...

Miss Pilbow goes to the mirror, quickly preens herself, then
turns and flips the intercom on.

			MISS PILBOW (CONT'D)
		(over loudspeaker)
	Mister Washington! Mister Warren!

She exits.

					CUT TO:

INT. DAY ROOM

as Miss Pilbow exits nurses' station and heads down the
hallway, Washington and Warren on her heels. Miller looking
wistfully after them.

					CUT TO:

INT. MAIN ENTRANCE - STATE HOSPITAL - DAY

Staff personnel are SEEN moving in and out of the main
entrance where a state penitentiary car is parked. A DEPUTY
SHERIFF leans on the fender smoking a cigarette as SECOND
DEPUTY SHERIFF comes out of the building and motions down to
First Deputy, who crushes his cigarette out, then opens the
rear door to the car.

			DEPUTY SHERIFF
		(to an unseen occupant)
	Okay, let's go.

A long beat, then McMurphy slowly emerges from the car. He's
wearing handcuffs and dressed in faded jeans, flannel work
shirt, leather jacket, black motorcycle cap, and heavy black
boots. He's been scrubbed clean and has a Band-Aid on his
cheek. McMurphy does a couple of knee bends to get the kinks
out of his legs as Deputy reaches in the car and takes out a
small gym bag containing McMurphy's belongings.

			DEPUTY SHERIFF (CONT'D)
	Let's move it...

McMurphy goes up the stairs, followed by the Deputy, and
crosses into the building.

INT. MAIN BUILDING - DAY

as McMurphy enters the building followed by the Deputies,
where Nurse Pilbow, McMurphy's folder in hand, and Washington
and Warren stand waiting -- all in a pleasant, receptive
mood. First Deputy hands McMurphy's gym bag to Washington,
who hands it to Warren.

			SECOND DEPUTY
	Okay, this is it!

McMurphy turns and holds out his hands. As cuffs are removed,
McMurphy impulsively takes hold of the Deputy's head and
plants a kiss on his forehead.

			SECOND DEPUTY (CONT'D)
		(squirming out of
		McMurphy's grasp)
	Jesus, you're crazy, McMurphy.

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah, ain't that the truth.

			DEPUTY SHERIFF
		(to Miss Pilbow)
	He's all yours, Miss.

			MISS PILBOW
	Thank you, Officer...

The two Deputies start down the stairs.

			MCMURPHY
	So long, fellas...

The two Deputies merely shrug their backs at McMurphy who
takes a deep breath of fresh air.

			MCMURPHY (CONT'D)
	Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall
	day...

			MISS PILBOW
	This way, Mister McMurphy.

			MCMURPHY
	Yes, ma'am...

McMurphy follows Nurse Pilbow into the hallway as the door
closes behind them.

					CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Other STAFF MEMBERS are administrative personnel are SEEN as
McMurphy walks alongside Nurse Pilbow, who is noticeably
nervous by his close proximity. Washington and Warren
casually bringing up the rear.

			MCMURPHY
		(as he peels the Band-Aid
		off, revealing a scar)
	I tell ya, these goons showered me
	at the courthouse this morning,
	last night at the jail, and I swear
	they'd have swabbed my ears out on
	the way over if they could've found
	the facilities...

A young Japanese nurse, named ITSU, passes by.

			MCMURPHY (CONT'D)
		(to Nurse Itsu)
	Hey, how ya doin', cutie?

			NURSE ITSU
	Okay. How you doing?

			MCMURPHY
	Just great!
		(calling after her)
	See ya around!

Nurse Itsu laughs and disappears around the corner.

			MCMURPHY (CONT'D)
		(to Nurse Pilbow)
	Yes, sir, I sure am gonna enjoy my
	stay here.

			MISS PILBOW
	I'm sure you will.

			MCMURPHY
		(to Nurse Pilbow)
	Ya know, I ain't never been in an
	institution of psychology before.

			MISS PILBOW
	Oh...

They arrive at the ward door. Nurse Pilbow unlocks the door
and opens it as...

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah, I'm here on a ninety-day
	observation period. Short-timer,
	like they say...

Soft nostalgic MUSIC is HEARD OVER.

			MISS PILBOW
	Of course.
		(indicating door)
	Mister McMurphy.

			MCMURPHY
	After you, ma'am.

			MISS PILBOW
	Thank you.

Nurse Pilbow enters the ward and McMurphy watches her cross
the visitors' area to a heavy-gauge steel screen wall, with
security gate which she opens.

			MCMURPHY
		(to Washington and Warren
		as they step into ward)
	Man, there sure is an awful lot of
	poontang around here.

			SPIVEY
		(calling)
	Hold it!

McMurphy turns to see DOCTOR SPIVEY approaching.

			SPIVEY (CONT'D)
	Good morning, boys.

			WASHINGTON AND WARREN
		(simultaneously as Spivey
		passes into the ward)
	Mornin', Doctor Spivey.

			SPIVEY
	Great day for fishing.

			WASHINGTON AND WARREN
		(simultaneously)
	Yes, sir!

The door closes. CAMERA HOLDS on sign that READS: 

SMILE AT THE NEXT FACE YOU SEE. IT MAY SAVE HIS LIFE.

			MCMURPHY (O.S.)
	Yeah, I was just thinking the same
	thing, Doc...

					CUT TO:

INT. WARD - DAY

as McMurphy, Spivey, Washington and Warren cross the
visitors' area towards Nurse Pilbow, who stands holding the
security gate open. At the far end of the hallway, which
opens into the day room, patients can be seen.

			SPIVEY
		(to McMurphy)
	Oh, what's that?

			MCMURPHY
	Why, I'll betcha there must be a
	million albacore and tuna running
	of the coast right this minute.

			SPIVEY
	Oh, do you do much fishing?

As they pass through the security gate:

			MCMURPHY
	Fish! Hell, Doc, I'd like to have a
	nickel for every fish I landed
	between Point Conception and the
	Alaska coast...

Washington and Warren continue down the hallway, passing
SEFELT, who shyly approaches and waits at a respectful
distance.

			SPIVEY
		(to McMurphy)
	Is that so?

			MCMURPHY
	Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay
	for just about every season since I
	was able to haul my own weight.

			SPIVEY
	My, my... Ah, who are you?

			MCMURPHY
	McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.

They shake hands.

			NURSE PILBOW
	Mister McMurphy is a new admission.

			SPIVEY
	Ah, yes. Well, we must talk soon,
	Mister McMurphy.

			MCMURPHY
	You bet, Doc.

Spivey turns to Sefelt.

			SPIVEY
	Good morning, Jim. How are you
	feeling?

			SEFELT
		(approaching and pointing
		to his mouth)
	Doc, my gungs hurt me.

Spivey starts checking out Sefelt's mouth.

			NURSE PILBOW
	This way, Mister McMurphy.

As McMurphy follows Nurse Pilbow down the hall, Spivey's
voice trails after him.

			SPIVEY (O.S.)
	Have you been taking your Dilantin,
	Jim?

			SEFELT (O.S.)
	Uh-huh...

			SPIVEY (O.S.)
	Well, we'll send you over to the
	dentist and see what he can do.
	Okay?

			SEFELT (O.S.)
	Okay, Doc!

McMurphy and Nurse Pilbow reach the day room.

			MISS PILBOW
	Make yourself at home, Mister
	McMurphy...

			MCMURPHY
	Thank you, ma'am,

Nurse Pilbow enters the nurses' station, closing the door
behind her. Next to the door is a bulletin board which, among
other bits of information, READS: 

TODAY IS MONDAY SEPTEMBER 30, 1963. THE NEXT MEAL IS LUNCH.
THE NEXT HOLIDAY IS HALLOWEEN.

Another notice READS: 

SIGN UP NOW! BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT STAFF VS PATIENTS.
Washington, Warren, Miller

There are no other names listed. Sefelt passes by.

			MCMURPHY (CONT'D)
	Hi.

			SEFELT
	Hi.

Sefelt crosses into the day room where he joins Fredrickson,
who is putting a jigsaw puzzle together.

INT. DAY ROOM - DAY

as McMurphy drifts into the room and looks around. The room
is as it was. The MUSIC ENDS. There is a CLICK. McMurphy's
attention is drawn to the nurses' station.

McMURPHY'S POV OF NURSES' STATION

where Miss Pilbow is SEEN through a large plate glass window,
busy typing a nameplate for McMurphy.

Big Nurse, her back to McMurphy, is turning over a stack of
records. She presses the phonograph button. A record falls on
the turntable and MUSIC BEGINS as she turns and sees
McMurphy.

ANOTHER ANGLE

McMurphy smiles and tips his hat to Big Nurse. 

Big Nurse smiles back and takes her seat. 

McMurphy turns and drifts into the day room. 

Big Nurse looks up and studies him. 

McMurphy catches the eye of a PATIENT, sitting by himself.

			MCMURPHY
	How ya doin', buddy?

			PATIENT
	Poorly, thank you.

			MCMURPHY
	Oh, yeah? What's ailing ya?

			PATIENT
	I got the fever.

			MCMURPHY
	Well, that's too bad...

Taber, pencil and paper in hand, crosses to McMurphy and taps
him on the shoulder.

			MCMURPHY (CONT'D)
	Yeah, buddy?

			TABER
	Are you a doctor?

			MCMURPHY
	No, 'fraid not...

Taber walks away.

Martini tugs at McMurphy's sleeve.

			MCMURPHY (CONT'D)
	Yeah, buddy?

			MARTINI
	Can you borrow me a dime?

			MCMURPHY
	Sorry, buddy, I'm clean outta
	change...

Scanlon moves in.

			SCANLON
	Got a cigarette?

			MCMURPHY
	Sure...

			MARTINI
	Me too! Me too!

As McMurphy hands out his cigarettes Bromden drifts by, mop
in hand.

			MCMURPHY
	Hey, how's it look up there, big
	boy?

			SCANLON
	He can't hear you. He's just a deaf
	and dumb Indian!

			MCMURPHY
	That right?

			HARDING (O.S.)
	Martini, it's your turn!

Martini is staring off into space.

			HARDING (O.S.) (CONT'D)
	Martini!

			MCMURPHY
		(to Martini)
	Your buddy is callin' ya.

Martini crosses back to the card game as Taber returns.

			MCMURPHY
	What's troubling ya, buddy?

			TABER
	I want you to write me a letter to
	my brother for a hundred dollars to
	bury me.

			MCMURPHY
	You look pretty healthy to me.

			TABER (CONT'D)
	I'm the next one.

			MCMURPHY
	How do ya know that?

			TABER (CONT'D)
	Because I quit breathing.

			MCMURPHY
	You're breathin' right now.

Taber walks away.

McMurphy watches him go.

Nearby, an OLD VEGETABLE squeaks.

			MCMURPHY
		(crossing to him)
	What's that, Pop?

The old man squeaks again.

			MCMURPHY
		(leaning in close)
	Can't hear ya, old-timer.

			OLD VEGETABLE
	Ain't this a pisser?

			MCMURPHY
	Hell, compared to where I just come
	from, this is a country club.

McMurphy crosses to the card game and stands watching the
game.

			MCMURPHY
	Whatcha boys playin'?

			BILLY
	H-H-Hearts.

			MCMURPHY
	Shoot! No wonder you don't care
	nothin' 'bout showin' your hand.

Billy holds his hand close to his chest.

			MCMURPHY
	What's your name, buddy?

			BILLY
	B-B-Billy.

			MCMURPHY
	Well, put 'er there, Billy boy, my
	name's McMurphy.

They shake hands.

			MCMURPHY
	What I wanna know is who's the top
	loony around here?

			BILLY (CONT'D)
	Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president
	of the P-P-Patients C-Council?

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah, that'll do for openers!

			BILLY (CONT'D)
		(to Harding)
	H-H-Harding, the m-m-man w-wants to
	t-talk to you, y-you're the pr-pr
	pr...

			HARDING
	Does he have an appointment?

			CHESWICK
	Yeah, do you have an appointment?

			MCMURPHY
	What for?

			CHESWICK
		(to Harding)
	What for?

			HARDING
	I'm a busy man!

			CHESWICK
		(to McMurphy)
	He's a busy man!

A beat; then:

			MCMURPHY
	I can wait...

McMurphy picks up a chair and sits down right next to Harding
and looks at him. Another beat; then:

			HARDING
		(to McMurphy)
	What are you doing?

			MCMURPHY
	I'm seeing what a busy man does.

Harding, very nervous at McMurphy's proximity, turns back to
the game.

			HARDING
	Your turn, Martini!

Martini is lost in the clouds.

			HARDING (CONT'D)
	Martini, throw a card!

Martini throws a diamond.

			HARDING (CONT'D)
	No, throw a club!

			CHESWICK
	Yeah, throw a club!

Martini throws a spade.

			HARDING
	Don't you have any clubs?

			MARTINI
	No!

			HARDING
	Let me see your hand!

			MARTINI
	No!

			HARDING
		(slamming his cards)
	Well, if you gentlemen will excuse
	me, I have some pressing matters to
	attend to.

Harding gets up and crosses to the hallway, gathering his
pride as he goes.

McMurphy slides into Harding's seat and rakes all the cards
in.

			MCMURPHY
	Yessir, that's why I came to this
	establishment for, to bring you
	birds fun and entertainment 'round
	the gamin' table...

McMurphy fans the deck out and lays it on the table.
Everyone's eyes pop as he scoops the cards up in one movement
-- he's a card shark, a magician -- leaving the Acutes with
their mouths hanging open.

			MCMURPHY
	Easy now, don't smudge 'em, we got
	lots of games ahead of us...

			BIG NURSE (O.S.)
	Mister McMurphy!

McMurphy turns to see Big Nurse approaching, Washington
casually bringing up the rear.

			MCMURPHY
	Yes, ma'am...

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
		(handing him his bag)
	Will you come with me, please.

			MCMURPHY
		(rising)
	Hold the fort down, will ya,
	fellas!

			BILLY
	Sure, Mack!

McMurphy walks with her toward the men's dorm.

			BIG NURSE
	My name is Miss Ratched. I'm the
	head nurse here. You've already met
	Miss Pilbow and Aides Washington
	and Warren.

			MCMURPHY
	Yes, ma'am.

Big Nurse and McMurphy stop at the security gate to the men's
dorm where Miller opens the gate.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Mister Miller, this is Mister
	McMurphy, who'll be staying with
	us.

Greetings are exchanged as they pass through.

INT. MEN'S DORM - DAY

as Big Nurse and McMurphy cross down the aisle.

			BIG NURSE
	We do appreciate the way you have
	taken it upon yourself to meet the
	other patients.

			MCMURPHY
	Thank you, ma'am...

Big Nurse stops at an empty bed where Warren is turning the
mattress down.

			BIG NURSE
	This is your bed. You may leave
	your things in that cabinet.

			MCMURPHY
	Yes, ma'am...

			BIG NURSE
	Please use your time to familiarize
	yourself with your new home and if
	there is anything you need to know,
	don't hesitate to ask us.

			MCMURPHY
	Now that you mention it, I sure
	would like to call my aunt up in
	Portland and tell 'er where I am so
	she can come visit me.

			BIG NURSE 
	All in good time, Mister McMurphy.
	All in good time.

			MCMURPHY
	Yes, ma'am.

			BIG NURSE 
	Good. Now if you'll just go along
	with Mister Washington, he'll see
	that you're properly oriented.

McMurphy doesn't move.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Is there anything else?

			MCMURPHY
	Just that I'm glad to be here, Miss
	Ratched. I really am.

			BIG NURSE 
	Good. I'm sure we'll be friends.

They smile, sizing up each other.

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking
	for a head nurse.

			BIG NURSE
	Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy.
	Go along.

			MCMURPHY
	Yes, ma'am.
		(to Washington)
	Lead the way, Sam.

They cross out of the men's dorm.

Big Nurse watches them go.

			SPIVEY (V.O.)
	What other work have you done?

INT. DOCTOR SPIVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

Doctor Spivey is seated behind his desk, on which are several
glass-framed photos of Spivey's family, plus a nameplate:
JOHN M. SPIVEY, M.D., and McMurphy's papers.

McMurphy, freshly showered and wearing hospital-issue
clothes, sits facing him.

			MCMURPHY
	Hell, Doc, I've been everything
	from a hoopla man with a two-bit
	carny show to a top mechanic and
	bull goose catskinner for every
	gypo loggin' operation in the
	Northwest till the Army taught me
	what my natural bent was.

			SPIVEY
	Oh, what was that?

			MCMURPHY
	Poker!

			SPIVEY 
	I see.

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah, but you know how society
	persecutes a dedicated man.

			SPIVEY (CONT'D)
	In what way?

			MCMURPHY
	They say I'm a habitual hassler.
	Like I fight some. Sheeut. They
	didn't mind so much when I was a
	dumb logger and got into a hassle.
	That's a hardworkin' feller blowing
	off steam, they say. But if you're
	a gambler, all you have to do is
	spit slantwise and you're a
	goddamned criminal.

			SPIVEY
	I see...

			MCMURPHY
	To tell the truth, ever since I
	found my natural callin' I done
	time in so many small-time jails I
	could write a brochure...

			SPIVEY 
	Yes... Ah, do you know why you're
	here?

			MCMURPHY
	Well, ya know, Doc...
		(indicating his papers)
	Doesn't it say so there?

			SPIVEY 
		(looking over papers)
	Well, according to the Warden at
	Pendleton, you were a disturbing
	influence on others. 'It appears
	that there is a potential in him
	for instigating a revolt among the
	other inmates.'
		(looking up at McMurphy)
	What do you think of that report?

			MCMURPHY
	I don't, Doc...

			SPIVEY 
		(goes back to papers)
	Arrested on an assault charge five
	times...

			MCMURPHY
	That's correct, Doc ...

			SPIVEY
		(reading from folder)
	The doctor at the prison states:
	'Don't overlook the possibility
	that this man may be faking
	psychosis to escape the drudgery of
	the work farm...' What do you say
	to that?

			MCMURPHY
	Doc, what can I tell ya?

			SPIVEY
	Ah, it seems you have no other
	psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?

			MCMURPHY
	No, this is my first trip, Doc.

			SPIVEY
		(closes folder and sits
		back)
	Well, you're here for a ninety-day
	observation period, Mister
	McMurphy. I'd like you to
	understand you are here on a court
	order and we are responsible to the
	state. So, I'd like your
	cooperation!

			MCMURPHY
	You bet, Doc!

			SPIVEY
	Good. Good.

INT. DAY ROOM - DAY

CAMERA is on Big Nurse as she stands, in front of a chair,
doing a deep breathing exercise.

The patients and staff, standing in front of chairs arranged
in a circle, follow suit as best they can. After a couple of
exercises Big Nurse sits. The others do the same except
Bancini, who remains standing, wagging his head back and
forth.

			BANCINI
	I'm tired. Whew. O Lord. Oh, I'm
	awful tired...

			BIG NURSE
		(busy with her papers)
	Somebody please see to Mister
	Bancini, so we can start the
	meeting.

Billy does... gently laying a hand on Bancini.

			BILLY
	T-t-t-take it e-e-easy, P-P-P
	Pete...

			BANCINI
	Awful tired...

Billy gently eases Bancini into his chair and sits beside
him, patting his skinny knee.

			BIG NURSE
	At the close of Friday's meeting,
	we were discussing Mister Harding's
	problem, concerning his wife...
		(reading from logbook)
	Mister Harding stated that his wife
	made him uneasy because she drew
	stares from men on the street. Is
	that correct, Mister Harding?

			HARDING
	Yes, that's perfectly correct.

			BIG NURSE
		(reading)
	He also thinks he may have given
	her reason to seek sexual attention
	elsewhere, but he didn't say how.
	He has been heard to say to his
	wife, 'I hate you, I don't ever
	want to see you again. You've
	betrayed me.'
		(she closes book)
	So. Does anyone care to touch upon
	this further?

Big Nurse waits. A long beat.

Harding sits, chewing his nails, tensely waiting, almost
wanting someone to begin.

The patients shift uncomfortably, looking in all directions.

McMurphy looks around to see what will follow, when he sees
Ellis, nailed to the wall; his pants leg darkens and a puddle
of piss forms at his feet. McMurphy looks to see if Big Nurse
or the Aides have noticed.

If they have, no one pays any attention.

McMurphy fidgets in his seat, then gets up, crosses to Ellis,
unhooks him from the wall, and moves him over a few feet.

The other patients are aghast at this move, look at each
other quizzically.

Big Nurse merely watches.

McMurphy crosses back to his chair and sits.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Mister McMurphy, this ward is a
	democratic community run by the
	patients and their votes, so you
	should feel at ease in your new
	surroundings to the extent you can
	freely discuss emotional problems
	in front of the patients and staff.
	However, the cardinal rule, and I
	must emphasize this: Everyone keeps
	their seat during the meeting!

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah, well, it just pains me
	somethin' awful to see a full
	growed man sloshing around in his
	own water...

			BIG NURSE
	Yes... We were discussing Mister
	Harding's problem with his wife.
	Now, who will start?
		(no response)
	Billy.

			BILLY
	M-m-m-ma'am?

			BIG NURSE
	Would you like to start?

			BILLY
	N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.

			BIG NURSE
	Mister Sefelt?

Sefelt shrugs and sinks into his seat.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Mister Fredrickson?

Fredrickson passes.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Mister Taber?

Taber passes.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Mister Martini?

			MARTINI
	No!

			BIG NURSE
	Mister Scanlon?

Scanlon looks at the floor.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Mister Cheswick?

Cheswick wags his head 'no.'

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Am I to take it that there isn't a
	man among you who has an opinion
	concerning this matter?
		(no response; she focuses
		in on Harding)
	Mister Harding, you've stated on
	more than one occasion that you
	suspected your wife of seeing other
	men.

			HARDING
	Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.

			BIG NURSE
	But you have no proof.

			HARDING
	No, Miss Ratched...

			BIG NURSE
	And yet you suspect her.

			HARDING
	Yes, that is correct.

			BIG NURSE
	Why?

			HARDING
	I can only speculate as to the
	reasons why.

			BIG NURSE
	Have you ever speculated, Mister
	Harding, that you are impatient
	with your wife because she does not
	meet your mental requirements?

One of the Chronics laughs like a child.

			HARDING
	Miss Ratched. Given all the
	conditions of that sublime
	relationship, coupled with the
	subsequent annihilation of all that
	I held to be sacred, mentally,
	physically and emotionally, the
	only thing that I can speculate on,
	at this late date, is how I will
	justify the very existence of my
	life, with or without my dear wife.

			SEFELT
	What's he talkin' about?

			TABER
	Yeah, Harding, why don't you
	knockoff the bullshit and get to
	the point.

Several Acutes chime in, "Yeah, get to the point," AD LIB.

			HARDING
	The point is, I will carry on until
	I fully understand what the
	function of that relationship is
	regardless of form or content.

Several hands go up.

			BIG NURSE
	Yes, Billy?

			BILLY
	I-I-I-I-I d-d-don't s-s-see how
	anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man
	who t-t-t-talks the way he does.

			TABER
	Yeah, Harding, you're so fuckin'
	dumb I can't believe it.

			HARDING
	That's a matter of opinion.

			SEFELT
	Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe
	anyway?

			FREDRICKSON
	Through the ass.

Sefelt and Fredrickson snicker into their hands. A few of the
others laugh.

			HARDING
		(smarting)
	Is that your sense of humor or are
	you trying to say something?

			FREDRICKSON
		(innocence itself)
	Now what would I be trying to say?

			HARDING
	I don't know. I don't know, but it
	makes me feel very peculiar when
	you throw in something like that.

			FREDRICKSON
	Peculiar?

			SEFELT
	Why?

			TABER
	Yeah, why?

			SCANLON
	Yeah, tell us why.

			HARDING
	I hesitate to go on.

			BIG NURSE
	No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's
	get it all out in the open...

			HARDING
	I mean, the other day you made an
	allusion to my wife and the
	possible sexual problems we might
	be having. I know that to be the
	case, but the way in which you
	broached it, if that's your idea of
	teaching me something...

			HARDING (CONT'D)
		(his voice rising as he
		goes on)
	... or making me aware of a
	condition in my life, then I say,
	categorically speaking, the hell
	with you, Taber!
	I don't have to justify the
	condition of my life to you or any
	of you. No matter what I will carry
	on until I fully understand what
	that function is regardless of the
	form or content. Regardless of the
	fact we must try to understand the
	function of our capacity to obtain,
	to personify the condition, the
	condition of our existence, our
	existence...

			TABER
	You know what, Harding? I think
	you're some kind of morbid asshole
	or something. You've been talking
	about your wife evere since I can
	remember. You know, she's on your
	mind and blah, blah, blah and on
	and on and when are you going to
	wise up and turn her loose!

			FREDRICKSON
	Yeah, wise up, Harding.

			SEFELT
	Yeah, turn her loose!

			ACUTES
		(start pouring it on)
	Yeah, who do you think you are
	anyway?... He thinks he's God
	Almighty... He's a snob... He's a
	schmuck... Dumbbell... Creep...
	Cretin... Idiot... Get rid of
	him... Ship him upstairs...

			RUCKLY
		(chiming in)
	Ffffffuck da wife...

			BANCINI
		(wagging his head)
	Tired... Awful tired...

			ACUTES
		(not letting up)
	Zap him... Give 'im lobotomy... Cut
	his nuts off... He doesn't have
	any... Fag... Pervert.

			BANCINI
		(in a strong angry voice)
	I'm tired!

Everyone hushes.

			BIG NURSE
	Somebody see to Mister Bancini.

Two or three Acutes get up and try to soothe Bancini, but he
isn't to be hushed.

			BANCINI
	Tired. Tired. Oh God, I'm tired...

Big Nurse nods to Washington, who goes to Pete, and gives his
arm a jerk toward the door. Bancini is unmovable.

Big Nurse signals Nurse Pilbow, who heads for the nurses'
station.

Washington senses danger, lets go of Pete's arm, backs away.

			WASHINGTON
	You a good boy, Mistah Bancini...

Nurse Pilbow returns, hypodermic needle in hand.

Pete turns to his fellow inmates.

			BANCINI
	You see... it's a lotta baloney...
	It's all a lotta baloney...

			NURSE PILBOW
	Yes, yes, Mister Bancini, now if
	you'll just be calm...

			BANCINI
	That's all it is, just a lotta
	baloney. Ya see, I can't help it,
	can't...

			NURSE PILBOW
		(working her way around
		Bancini)
	Yes, I know, I know...

She gets him in the ass, with the needle, and springs back.

			BANCINI
	... don't ya see. I was born dead.
	Not you. You wasn't born dead.
	Ahhh, it's been so hard...
		(starts going over,
		slowly; sighing and
		crying)
	Tired... I'm tired... aw-ful
	tired...

McMurphy looks around at the others.

Each patient is locked in his own world -- oblivious to
Bancini's state.

EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY

WIDE SHOT of entire court, surrounded by a high fence topped
off with barbed wire, as Washington and Warren escort the
Acutes -- including Bromden, Ellis, a lobotomy case and
several other Chronics -- through the gate onto the court,
which is run down, with cracks in its surface and leaves
scattered everywhere.

Martini, who is carrying the ball, runs ahead, followed by
Scanlon, where he starts dribbling the ball in a frantic
circle, suddenly passes the ball to nothing.

			MARTINI
		(as he throws ball)
	Catch it! Catch it!

The ball rolls to the corner.

			WASHINGTON
	Martini, there ain't nobody there,
	ya dumb goon! Go get the ball!

			MARTINI
	No!

Martini turns away, his feelings hurt. Washington goes after
the ball, when Martini goes running after it.

			MARTINI (CONT'D)
	I get it! I get it!

But Washington gives Martini a body check and beats him to
the ball.

Martini tries to get the ball from Washington, who is quite
agile and teases him as he returns to the court where he and
Warren start shooting baskets, freezing Martini and Scanlon
out.

The other patients just hang around or walk, as if in a
prison yard.

Cheswick stands in close proximity to McMurphy and Harding,
who stand watching the action. McMurphy finally offers a
cigarette to Harding, who accepts. They both light up.

			MCMURPHY
	Well, say, buddy, is that the usual
	pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py
	shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a
	peckin' party?

			HARDING
	A pecking party?

			MCMURPHY
	That's right, buddy. And you want
	to know who pecks the first peck?

			HARDING AND CHESWICK
	Who? Who?

			MCMURPHY
	Ah, come off it! It's that Big
	Nurse, that's who...

The other Acutes have gathered around McMurphy and Harding.

			HARDING
	It's as simple as that. You've been
	on our ward six hours and have
	already simplified the work of
	Freud, Jung and Maxwell Jones in
	one grand analogy: it's a pecking
	party.

			MCMURPHY
	I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or
	Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm
	talkin' about is that crummy
	meeting and what that nurse did to
	you!

			HARDING
	Did to me?

			MCMURPHY
	Did to you and all the rest of you
	guys.

			BILLY
	Y-y-yes! Yes! Y-y-y-you s-s-saw wh
	wh-what she c-c-can do to us!

			MCMURPHY
	What did I see 'cept a grown man
	gettin' whipped so bad he can't
	laugh anymore.

			FREDRICKSON
	It's the questions she asks.

			MCMURPHY
	Tell 'er to go straight to hell!

			HARDING
	Miss Ratched is a competent
	psychiatric nurse, not some, some
	kind of monster pecking out our
	eyes!

			MCMURPHY
		(as calm as blue waters)
	She ain't peckin' at your eyes,
	buddy.

McMurphy grabs Harding by his balls and Harding goes up on
his toes.

			MCMURPHY
	She's peckin' at your balls, buddy,
	at your ever-lovin' balls.

Harding is doubled over.

			SEFELT
	That kind of behavior will get you
	a P.A. rating, my friend.

			MCMURPHY
	P.A. What the hell is that?

			SEFELT 
	Potential assaultive.

			FREDRICKSON
	Which gets you shipped up to
	Disturbed for a nice little zap
	job.

			MCMURPHY
	Huh?

			HARDING
	Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend.
	Five cents' worth of electricity
	and you are out of everybody's
	hair.

			MCMURPHY
	Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!

			HARDING (CONT'D)
	And if you persist in your ways,
	they can always ship you over to
	Medical Surgery.

			MCMURPHY
	What for?

			HARDING (CONT'D)
	Lobotomy!

			MCMURPHY
	Lobotomy?

			HARDING (CONT'D)
		(pointing to lobotomy
		case)
	That!

McMurphy looks.

SHOT OF A LOBOTOMY CASE

A vegetable, complete with two half-dollar scars in his
forehead.

McMURPHY

As he absorbs this bit of information the basketball rolls to
his feet and he picks it up.

			MCMURPHY
		(to Harding)
	Is that your sense of humor or are
	you tryin' to say somethin'?

			HARDING
	Now, what would I be trying to say?

Martini and Scanlon rush over and try to get the ball.

			SCANLON
	Gimme the ball!

			MARTINI
	No. Me! Me!

			WASHINGTON (O.S.)
	Pass the ball, McMurphy.

McMurphy crosses to the court, bouncing the ball as he goes.
When he reaches the court he holds the ball out to
Washington, who reaches for it, but McMurphy snaps it back
over his shoulder to Martini.

			MCMURPHY
		(turning to Martini)
	Pass it to me, Martini.

Martini holds back.

			MCMURPHY
	C'mon, I'll give it back!

Martini passes to McMurphy.

			MCMURPHY
	Atta boy, Martini.

He passes it back to Martini, who laughs and passes it back
to McMurphy, who passes it to Scanlon, who passes to
McMurphy, who passes to Billy, etc. Bromden just stands
watching.

			MCMURPHY
		(encouraging them)
	Back and forth, that's it. Shoot,
	man, we'll be takin' on the New
	York Knicks before we're through...

McMurphy looks to see Big Nurse looking out a window at them.
He catches her eye. She turns away.

			MCMURPHY (V.O)
	Hey-ya, hey-ya, come on, come on,
	I'm waitin' on you suckers, you hit
	or you sit...

INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT

The MUSIC is PLAYING. The TV is on the six o'clock news as
McMurphy, cards in hand, is dealing blackjack to Cheswick,
Harding, Sefelt, Billy and Martini. Fredrickson and Scanlon
are looking on as Bromden eases up to the game. Cheswick is
at the nurses' station talking to Big Nurse.

			SEFELT
	Hit me!

			MCMURPHY
	Hit, you say? Well well well and
	with a king up, the boy wants a
	hit. Whadaya know.
	So comin' at you and too bad, a
	little lady for the lad and he's
	over the wall and down the road, up
	the hill and dropped his load.

			SEFELT
	Boogered!

McMurphy rakes in Sefelt's cigarettes, adding them to a pile
of loose cigarettes, packs of cigarettes, several cartons of
cigarettes.

As Cheswick sits down, depressed:

			MCMURPHY
	'Kay, place your bets.

			MARTINI
		(holding up a cigarette)
	What's this?

			MCMURPHY
	That's a dime, Martini.

Martini breaks a cigarette in half.

			MARTINI (CONT'D)
	Bet a nickel!

			MCMURPHY
		(to Cheswick)
	Whadaya bet, Cheswick?

			CHESWICK
	She won't give me any more
	cigarettes!

			MCMURPHY
	That okay. I'll take your marker.
	How many ya want?

			CHESWICK (CONT'D)
	Lend me twenty.

McMurphy counts out twenty cigarettes, marks it down on a
piece of paper, and passes the cigarettes to Cheswick, who
bets all twenty.

The Sports have come on TV and McMurphy's attention is
divided.

			MCMURPHY
		(checking the board)
	'Kay, all bets are down, let's
	wheel 'em an' deal 'em.

He deals the cards out, the first one face down, then the
next one face up.

			MCMURPHY
	Big king... little deuce... another
	king... a lovely lady... big ten...
	and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya
	say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?

			MARTINI
	Hit me.

			MCMURPHY
		(hits with a picture)
	That's twenty up, Martini.
		(turning to TV, he shouts
		across room)
	Hey, Taber, who's pitching the
	opening game?

Taber calls back something but it's lost in the other sounds.

			MARTINI (CONT'D)
	Hit me!

			MCMURPHY
	Wait a minute, Martini, I can't
	hear a thing.
		(turning back to Taber)
	What?

			TABER
		(shouting back)
	Koufax against Ford!

			MISS PILBOW (V.O.)
		(over loudspeaker)
	Medication time! Medication time!
	Medication!

			MARTINI
		(simultaneously with
		Pilbow)
	Hit me!

McMurphy slams his cards down, stands up, crosses the day
room, heading for the nurses' station. He passes Washington,
who stands there waiting to dispense orange juice.

INT. NURSES' STATION - NIGHT

as McMurphy enters. Nurse Pilbow is the only one there.

			MCMURPHY
	Pardon me miss, but would you mind
	turning...

			NURSE PILBOW
		(scared out of her wits)
	Stay back! Patients aren't allowed
	to enter the... Oh, stay back!

			MCMURPHY
	All I'm askin' is...

Nurse Pilbow grabs at her cross, screams and shuts her eyes,
holding the cross in front of her.

			NURSE PILBOW (CONT'D)
	Oh, stay back, I'm a Catholic!

Big Nurse enters from the nurses' lounge.

			BIG NURSE
	Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't
	allowed in here.

			MCMURPHY
	Sorry, ma'am.

McMurphy steps out of the station, closing the door behind
him.

INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT

as McMurphy goes around to the front of the nurses' station
and queues up behind the other Acutes who are getting their
medication. McMurphy reaches the window, takes the cup, but
doesn't take his pills.

			MCMURPHY
		(to Big Nurse)
	Pardon me, ma'am, can I ask you
	somethin'?

			BIG NURSE
		(politely)
	Yes, Mister McMurphy?

			MCMURPHY
	How 'bout turning off that music
	for a while so a man can hear
	himself think?

			BIG NURSE
		(pleasantly)
	That music is for everyone, Mister
	McMurphy.

McMurphy leans in, placing his hand on the window.

			MCMURPHY
		(confidentially)
	Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down
	a bit so a man don't have to shout!

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
		(aware of his physical
		proximity)
	Mister McMurphy, there are old men
	here who couldn't hear the music at
	all if it were lower. That music is
	all they have, and I wish you
	wouldn't lean against the glass
	there, your hands are staining the
	window.

McMurphy jerks his hand away.

			MCMURPHY
	Sorry, ma'am... Sorry 'bout that...

McMurphy breathes on the glass and wipes it clean with his
sleeve.

			MCMURPHY
	Sorry to have bothered you.

			BIG NURSE 
	Not at all, Mister McMurphy...

McMurphy turns to walk away.

			NURSE PILBOW
	Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.

			MCMURPHY
		(turning back, he examines
		the contents of the cup)
	What's the horse pill for, honey?

			NURSE PILBOW
	It's just medication, Mister
	McMurphy, good for you. Now down it
	goes...

			MCMURPHY
	Look, miss, I don't like swallowing
	something without knowing what it
	is!

			NURSE PILBOW 
		(stepping back a little)
	Don't get upset, Mister McMurphy...

			MCMURPHY
	I'm not upset. All I wanna know,
	for the lovva Jesus...

			BIG NURSE
	That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if
	Mister McMurphy does not wish to
	take his medication orally, he
	may...

			MCMURPHY
	No, that's okay, ma'am. Down it
	goes.

McMurphy makes a big show of popping the pill in his mouth,
holding his paper cup upside down, for all to see, then
moving on to Washington, who fills it with orange juice.

McMurphy gulps it down, not without some difficulty, then he
smiles at all the concerned faces and crosses the room to the
card table, where he sits to see the Acutes looking at him.

			HARDING
	Why didn't you tell her to go to
	hell, lover boy?

			TABER
	Yeah, whattsa matter, Mack, she too
	much for ya?

McMurphy holds the pill up and flicks it into Harding's
forehead.

			MCMURPHY
	You boys seem to think you've got a
	champ in there, huh?

			HARDING
	I don't see you scoring any points,
	buddy. And you're just the man for
	the job, right?

			MCMURPHY
	Hell, I couldn't get it up over old
	hatchet-face if ya paid me!

			HARDING (CONT'D)
	She's not all that homely, Mister
	McMurphy. In fact, she must have
	been a rather beautiful young lady.

The men look at Big Nurse.

The patients look at the nurses' station.

PATIENTS' POV

Big Nurse is busy at her work.

INT. NURSES STATION - BIG NURSE'S POV - NIGHT

The patients looking at her. They turn back to their card
game.

REVERSE ANGLE

CAMERA HOLDS on Big Nurse as McMurphy's VOICE is HEARD over
INTERCOM.

			MCMURPHY (V.O.)
		(through intercom)
	Yeah, an' I'm tellin' ya, she's
	just an icy-hearted over-the-hump
	gal who never got enough of the old
	wham-bam to straighten 'er out...
	Okay, who wants a card?

			MARTINI (V.O.)
		(through intercom)
	Me. Hit me!

Big Nurse looks up and studies the men gathered round the
table.

INT. MEN'S DORM - NIGHT

The patients are asleep except for Bromden, who stands by the
window looking out.

McMurphy is asleep in the bed next to his. A beat when
TURKLE, a fifty-year-old Negro night attendant, slightly
drunk, lays a gentle hand on Bromden's shoulder.

			TURKLE
	Le's get back to bed, Mistah
	Bromden...

Bromden allows himself to be led back to bed. Turkle fumbles
around for the security belt, finds it, straps Bromden
loosely in bed, then goes off clucking to himself.

Bromden reaches under his bed and plucks a stale piece of gum
from under the bed frame. He starts chewing it when he sees
McMurphy looking at him.

Bromden goes right on chewing and looking McMurphy right in
the eye.

			MCMURPHY
		(whispering)
	Chief? I wanna ask ya somethin'.
		(sings)
	Oh, does the spearmint lose its
	flavor on the bedpost overnight?
	When you chew it in the morning,
	will it be too hard to bite? This
	question's got me goin', won't
	somebody set me right; does the
	spearmint lose its flavor on the
	bedpost overnight?

McMurphy holds the last note, reaches over and rustles
through his nightstand.

			MCMURPHY
	Here ya go, Chief...

A small object lands on Bromden's bed. It is a fresh package
of gum. Bromden picks it up. Examines it. Unwraps it.
Deposits his old piece of gum under the bed frame, then
inserts the fresh gum in his mouth and starts chewing.

SERIES OF SHOTS

SHOWING the MEN'S DORM, the empty DAY ROOM, TURKLE ASLEEP in
the NURSES' STATION, EMPTY HALLWAYS, the NIGHT SUPERINTENDENT
AT HER DESK, MORE HALLWAYS... ENDING ON:

INT. MEN'S DORM - SUNRISE

ABERRATED SHOT of INSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS SEEN THROUGH STEEL
MESH SCREEN -- as the sun rises above the treetops.

REVERSE SHOT - BROMDEN

looking out of the window. His face washed by the sunlight.
His eyes have a vague look, almost vacuous, as...

			BIG NURSE (V.O.)
		(through loudspeaker)
	Good morning, boys. Rise and shine.
	Rise and shine.

INT. MEN'S DORM - DAY

as Washington, Warren and Miller roust the patients out of
bed.

			BIG NURSE (V.O.)
		(through loudspeaker)
	Time to got up! Come on now, it's a
	beautiful day! Let's not straggle!
	Everybody up, up, up!

McMurphy is in bed, not ready for the world, when Washington
crosses to Bromden, who is looking out the window, and leads
him off.

			WASHINGTON
	Le's go, Chief. Le's go get
	ourselves all nice and clean...
		(to McMurphy)
	You too, Mistah Mack-Murphy!

Washington goes off with Bromden.

CAMERA HOLDS on McMurphy as he slowly pulls it together and
sits on the edge of the bed. He's naked as he opens the
drawer to his nightstand and fishes around for a cigarette.

			MCMURPHY
		(looking in the drawer)
	What the...
		(looking around)
	Who the fuck stole my cigarettes!

INT. DAY ROOM - DAY

as the Acutes straggle past Big Nurse.

			BIG NURSE
	Good morning, Mister Sefelt, are
	your teeth any better?... Good
	morning, Mister Fredrickson... Good
	morning, Mister Harding;
	my, my, you've been biting your
	fingernails again...

She sees McMurphy approaching, wearing a towel around his
waist and a scowl on his face.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Mister McMurphy, patients are not
	permitted to run around in towels.

			MCMURPHY
	I wanna report a robbery!

			BIG NURSE
	On this ward?

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah, some creep stole my
	cigarettes!

			BIG NURSE 
	Oh, I had them removed.

			MCMURPHY
	What for?

			BIG NURSE 
	Patients are rationed to one pack
	of cigarettes a day.

Bromden comes drifting by, going in the opposite direction.
Big Nurse takes his hand.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
		(calling out)
	Mister Washington!

Washington comes running.

			WASHINGTON
	Yes, Miss Ratched?

			BIG NURSE
	Please see to Mister Bromden.

			WASHINGTON
		(taking Bromden by the
		hand)
	Yes, Miss Ratched...

Washington leads Bromden off. Big Nurse turns to Cheswick and
several other Acutes, who have crowded around.

			BIG NURSE
	Now you boys hurry along and wash
	up for breakfast...
		(to McMurphy)
	You too, Mister McMurphy.

			MCMURPHY
	Well, say. How 'bout springing a
	pack of cigarettes loose?

			BIG NURSE
	After breakfast, Mister McMurphy,
	after breakfast.

			MCMURPHY
	You sure run a tight-assed ship
	'round here, don't ya!

			BIG NURSE
	Yes. Now run along like a good boy
	and see that you wash up properly.

WIDER ANGLE

A beat, as the Acutes wait for McMurphy's next move, then:

			MCMURPHY
	'Kay, let's go brush our teeth,
	fellas...

McMurphy turns and crosses toward the washroom, singing at
the top of his lungs.

			MCMURPHY
	Oh, Lulu had a baby,
	His name was Sunny Jim,
	She put 'im in a piss pot,
	To teach 'im how to swim.
	Oh, he swam to the bottom,
	He swam to the top,
	Lulu got excited,
	An' pulled 'im by his...
	Cock-tail ginger-ale,
	Five cents a glass,
	An' if ya don't like it
	Ya can shove it up your...
	Ask me no more questions,
	I'll tell ya no more lies.

BIG NURSE

watching McMurphy who removes his towel as he enters the
washroom.

INT. WASHROOM - DAY

as McMurphy enters to see Warren take a firm grip on
Bromaen's head and Washington goes to work on Bromden's face.
CAMERA PUSHES INTO EXTREME CLOSEUP of Bromden's fearfully
distorted face as the BUZZING SOUND of the ELECTRIC RAZOR
INTENSIFIES until it is INSUPPORTABLE.

INT. MESS HALL - DAY

We SEE the attendants spooning food into the sucking pink
mouths of the vegetables, a shade too fast for swallowing.

			MCMURPHY (O.S.)
	What's wrong with you guys?

We SEE McMurphy seated with the Acutes, shoveling food down
his guillet. The others are barely touching their food.

			MCMURPHY
	Why, if I'd have known how soft
	this place was gonna be, I'd have
	arranged for my transfer sooner...
		(holding up his orange
		juice)
	Look at this here, real orange
	juice!
		(slugging it down)
	Hooee, that's good. Why, you
	couldn't pay me to leave this
	place!
		(slaps his belly)
	All this place lacks is a couple of
	sweet gals to liven things up...

He gets up and carries his tray to the proper place, where he
notices Miller loading several other trays onto a dumbwaiter.
Miller pushes a button and the dumbwaiter goes down. McMurphy
crosses to the door to find it blocked by Washington.

			MCMURPHY
	Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'.

			WASHINGTON
	Nobody leaves here till seven
	thirty.

McMurphy turns Washington over in his mind, then he looks up
at the clock above the door.

The time is 7:28. The second hand sweeping its way toward
7:29.

			MCMURPHY
	Don't know if I can hold it that
	long, Sam.

			WASHINGTON (CONT'D)
	Tha's your problem.

			MCMURPHY
		(confidentially)
	Who do you like in the opening
	game, Sam?

			WASHINGTON (CONT'D)
	Huh?

			MCMURPHY
		(turning away)
	Asshole.

McMurphy turns and walks away.

Washington watches him go.

			CHESWICK (V.O.)
	I wanna know about my cigarettes!

INT. DAY ROOM - DAY

A group meeting is in progress. Doctor Spivey is there.

Cheswick is on his feet.

			BIG NURSE
	Sit down, Mister Cheswick.

			CHESWTCK
		(not sitting)
	No, I ain't no kid to have my
	cigarettes keep from me like
	cookies! Ain't that right, Mack!
		(McMurphy doesn't respond)
	Mack???

			BIG NURSE
	Sit down, Mister Cheswick!

Cheswick sits -- stunned. A beat; then:

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
		(to Cheswick)
	You should have thought about that
	before you gambled all your
	cigarettes away. Is that clear?

Cheswick sulks in his seat.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Mister Cheswick, is that clear!

			CHESWICK
	Yeah...

			BIG NURSE
	Good...
		(opens her book)
	Now, as I recall, we were making
	quite a bit of headway, last time,
	with Mister Harding's problem. So,
	does anyone care to begin?

McMurphy's hand goes up. No one else's does.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Yes, Mister McMurphy.

			MCMURPHY
	Right... I've been givin' some
	serious consideration to what you
	told me about the democratic
	something of this therapeutic
	community of ours, an' I got a few
	things I wanna get off my chest,
	before we get back to Harding's
	problem.

			BIG NURSE
	Certainly, Mister McMurphy.

			MCMURPHY
	Right!

McMurphy takes a folded sheet of paper out of his pocket,
unfolds it, studies it and begins.

			MCMURPHY
	'Kay... Item one... I've been
	thinkin' 'bout the age problem we
	got on this ward. You know, the
	young an' old livin' together, an'
	I was thinkin' what a great thing
	it would be if the music was turned
	up louder. Louder so the old fellas
	could hear better...

Doctor Spivey nods with approval.

Big Nurse doesn't.

The Acutes are bewildered.

			MCMURPHY
	But then I got to thinkin', the
	music is so loud already, it makes
	it difficult for the young fellas
	to hold a decent conversation...

Nods and murmurs of approval from the Acutes.

Big Nurse can only wait for McMurphy's next move.

			MCMURPHY
	Well, I was turnin' this dilemma
	over in my head, when I happened to
	hit on that old tub room out there,
	an' I said to myself, McMurphy, I
	said, that place would make a great
	second day room. A sort of game
	room for the young fellas. Whadaya
	think, Doc?

			SPIVEY
	It is worth considering... Miss
	Ratched?

			BIG NURSE
	The point is well taken, Doctor,
	but do we have the necessary
	personnel to cover a second day
	room?

			SPIVEY
	Well, since it will be largely the
	Chronics who remain here, one aide
	and one nurse should easily be able
	to handle any situation that might
	occur.
		(he turns to the patients)
	What do you think, men, is it
	workable?

			CHESWICK
	Right, Doc. It's workable.

Several other Acutes voice in the affirmative.

			SPIVEY
	Fine!

			BIG NURSE
	Good. Good. Yes, yes, I think we
	should give it a trial period. So!
	May we get back to Mister Harding's
	problem...
		(she sees McMurphy's hand
		up)
	Yes, Mister McMurphy?

			MCMURPHY
	I'm not finished yet.

			BIG NURSE 
	Go on...

			MCMURPHY
		(looking at his list)
	'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and
	listen carefully to me, you ding-a
	lings. Tomorrow is the opening game
	of the World Series an' what I want
	is to take a vote on switchin' the
	group meetin' to later on in the
	day, so we can watch the ballgame.

			BIG NURSE
	Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah?

			BIG NURSE 
	Please understand, the schedule has
	been set up for a delicately
	balanced reason that would be
	thrown into turmoil by a switch of
	routines.

			MCMURPHY
	The hell with the schedule, you can
	get back to the schedule next week
	when the series is over. What I
	want is a vote on it right now!

			CHESWICK
	I second the motion!

			MCMURPHY
	Atta boy, Cheswick!

			BIG NURSE
	Very well! All those in favor,
	please raise your hands.

Big Nurse casts a watchful eye over the patients.

			MCMURPHY
		(raising his hand)
	Okay, raise your hands.

Only Cheswick's goes up.

			MCMURPHY
	Come on', what is this crap? Who
	wants to watch the World Series?

Martini and Scanlon's hands go up.

Several Acutes look at them.

Scanlon and Martini's hands go down.

McMurphy can't believe his eyes.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
		(politely)
	I count only two, including you,
	Mister McMurphy. Certainly not
	enough to change ward policy.

McMurphy's hand goes down.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Yes. Now was there anything else
	you wanted to discuss, Mister
	McMurphy?

			MCMURPHY
	No way.

			CHESWICK
	No way.

McMurphy starts tearing his sheet of paper up into a thousand
pieces.

			BIG NURSE
		(checking her watch)
	Then I suggest we turn our
	attention back to Mister Harding's
	problem. Would anybody care to
	begin?

She looks around.

McMurphy is slouched in his chair.

Harding puts his hands up. No one else does.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Yes, Mister Harding?

			HARDING
	Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since
	our last meeting I have been
	reflecting, quite seriously, on the
	nature of my problem. Naturally,
	I'm referring to the capacity to
	obtain the necessary results in
	order to obtain... No, no. To
	personify the very existence of
	that relationship regardless of the
	function...
		(he stops, chews his lip,
		then continues)
	Regardless of the function, we will
	confront the question of... Yes.
	Yes. The question of...
	Existence... Relationship...
	Function... Confront... Yes,
	confronting us in the moment of
	deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis
	of our souls. Of our souls, which I
	am trying to fully understand the
	problem... the problem. Not to shut
	ourselves off, but somehow...
	Somehow to understand fully our
	capacity... to obtain... to
	personify... the question...
	existence depends... depends on the
	question... to reflect... to
	reflect...

Harding, breaks off, sweating; he begins to knead his
forehead and chew his nails.

			HARDING (CONT'D)
	To reflect...

ANGLE

Silence as the CAMERA REFLECTS: the room, the patients, the
staff, the hallways, the hospital, the grounds, the trees,
the sky, ending on.

			MARTINI (V.O.)
	Hold it a minute. What's a man need
	to buy thum hotels?

INT. TUB ROOM - NIGHT

Bromden is pressed against the wall, watching McMurphy,
Martini, Scanlon and Cheswick play a game of monopoly. The
others are playing cards or just hanging around, a little
chagrined. Billy is most disturbed by this separation.

			MCMURPHY
	You need four houses on every lot
	of the same color, Martini. Now
	let's go, for Christsakes.

			MARTINI
	Hold it a minute.

There's a flurry of money from Martini, red, green and yellow
bills blowing in every direction.

			CHESWICK
	Let's go, for Christsakes...

			MCMURPHY
	It's your dirty roll, Cheswick.

Cheswick rolls the dice.

			MCMURPHY
	Snake eyes! Hoooeee, that puts you
	on my Marvin Gardens, which means
	you owe me three hundred and fifty
	dollars.

Cheswick starts counting out the money.

			MARTINI
	What's thum other things? Hold it a
	minute. What's thum other things
	all over the board?

			CHESWICK
		(to Martini)
	How can a man concentrate with you
	sitting there hallucinating a mile
	a minute...

			MCMURPHY
	You just come on with that three
	fifty and Martini will take care of
	himself... Your dice, Scanlon.

			SCANLON
	Gimme those dice. I'll blow this
	board to pieces. Here we go... 
		(throws the dice)
	Lebenty leben, count me over
	eleven, Martini...

Martini picks up a house...

			SCANLON (CONT'D)
	Not that one, you crazy bastard,
	that's my house...

Scanlon grabs Martini's hand and tries to get his piece back.
Martini won't let go.

			MCMURPHY
	Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I
	got enough troubles without you
	guys messin' around... can't depend
	on nobody.

			BILLY
		(from the next table)
	Some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here
	a long t-t-time, Randle, and will b
	b-be here long after this Wo-Wo
	World Series of yours is oh-oh-oh,
	what's the use anyway...

McMurphy slams his fist down on the table, sending the
monopoly pieces flying. Martini is crestfallen.

			MCMURPHY
	What's the use! Hooee! It'd do you
	birds some good just to get a
	little exercise lifting your arms
	to vote!

			HARDING
	A baseball game isn't worth the
	risk, my friend.

			MCMURPHY
	It is to me! An' if I hafta bust
	way outta this place to see it, I
	will!

			CHESWICK
	Right!

			FREDRICKSON
	Oh, yeah?

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah!

			SEFELT
	Big man!

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah, how much you wanna bet?

			SEFELT 
	On what?

			MCMURPHY
	That me an' my buddy, Cheswick,
	we'll be downtown tomorrow watchin'
	the ballgame while you suckers are
	sittin' around this goddamn
	nursery!

			HARDING
	And how do you propose to
	accomplish that little feat, my
	friend?

			MCMURPHY
	That's between me an' myself. So
	why don't you boys just shove off.
	I got some planning to do.

McMurphy sits and resumes his game of solitaire. Martini and
Scanlon are putting the monopoly game back together again.

Bromden spots (or he thinks he spots) one of the attendants
listening at the door. He wants to warn the others, but
doesn't know how.

			SEFELT
	Maybe he'll just show Miss Ratched
	his big thing an' she'll open the
	door for him.

Sefelt and Frederickson smile at each other.

Bromden slides along the wall toward the door.

			MCMURPHY
	Maybe I'll just use that thick
	skull of yours as a batterin' ram,
	Sefelt.

			SEFELT (CONT'D)
	Why, my head would just squash like
	an eggplant, McMurphy.

Fredrickson and Sefelt snicker in their hands.

			MCMURPHY
	You think it's funny, huh?

			TABER
	Yeah, you don't know how to get
	outta this place!

Bromden reaches the door and looks out. No one is there.

			MCMURPHY
	Put your money where your mouth is,
	Taber.

			TABER (CONT'D)
	Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony,
	McMurphy!

Bromden turns back to the room to see McMurphy slam his fist
down on the table; the monopoly game goes flying.

			MCMURPHY
		(rising and turning on the
		others, who back off)
	You want me to show ya! You want me
	to show ya how!

			TABER (CONT'D)
	Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!

			MCMURPHY
	All right!

He looks wildly around the room, spots the machine, crosses
to it and smacks it with his hand.

			MCMURPHY
	With this thing! I'm gonna put this
	thing right through the window,
	that's how!

			HARDING
	You mean you're going to try to
	pick that thing up and shove it
	through the window?

			MCMURPHY
	You're fuckin' A-right, I am!

			HARDING (CONT'D)
	With your own two hands?

			MCMURPHY
	You heard me the first time!

			TABER
	I'll bet a buck you don't do it!

			MCMURPHY
	You're on!

			BILLY
	M-M-Mack, y-y-y-you c-c-can't l-l
	lift that thing!

			MCMURPHY
	Stand aside, son. Any more takers?

			SEFELT
	I'll bet a dollar.

			FREDRICKSON
	Me, too...

			MCMURPHY
	Right!

			MARTINI
	A nickel.

			SCANLON
	A dime.

			MCMURPHY
	Okay. Who else?

			HARDING
	Twenty-five dollars.

			MCMURPHY
		(knows he's taking a bad
		bet)
	Okay, Harding, you're on.

			HARDING 
	Okay, sucker.

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you
	guys! You're usin' up my oxygen!

The Acutes stand aside and McMurphy steps up to the machine.

He shifts his feet to get a good stance, wipes his hands on
his thighs, leans down and gets hold of the levers on each
side, and strains.

Bromden watches, in awe of McMurphy.

McMurphy turns loose, straightens up and shifts his feet for
a better position.

			HARDING
	Giving up?

			MCMURPHY
	Just warmin' up.

He grabs the levers again. His whole body shakes with the
strain. For just a second we HEAR the cement GRIND. Then his
breath explodes and he falls back limp against the wall.
There's blood on his hands. No sound but his rasping breath.
He opens his eyes and looks around. Then pulls out a
pocketful of IOU's and tries to sort them out, but his hands
are frozen into red claws. He throws the whole bundle on the
floor and walks out. At the door, he turns back.

			MCMURPHY
	But I tried. Goddammit, I sure as
	hell did that much. Didn't I?

McMurphy exits.

REACTION SHOT OF ACUTES

SHOT OF BROMDEN

looking at the machine. A long beat.

INT. MEN'S DORM - NIGHT

The patients are getting ready for bed when Billy approaches
McMurpby, who is in bed.

			BILLY
	M-M-Mack...

McMurphy turns away from Billy, who crosses to the other side
of the bed.

			BILLY (CONT'D)
	M-M-Mack, I-I-I'm sorry!

			HARDING
	Leave him alone, he's pouting.

			BILLY
	Y-Y-Y-You leave him alone!

			MCMURPHY
	That's okay, kid...

			BILLY 
	Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m
	mad?

			MCMURPHY
	No, kid, it was my own stupidity,
	that's what pissed me off.

			BILLY 
	O-o-o-oh...

			MCMURPHY
	What we're gonna have to do is pull
	this ballclub together for our next
	play. 'Kay!

			BILLY
	'K-k-kay, Mack!

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Washington, Warren and Miller are at the end of the hallway,
listening to a small RADIO. We can HEAR the SPORTS ANNOUNCER
giving the line-up for the opening game of the World Series.

			WASHINGTON'S POV
	Way down the hall, the Group
	Meeting is SEEN in progress.

INT. DAY ROOM - DAY

A Group Meeting is in progress and Big Nurse is honed in on
Billy.

			BIG NURSE
	Try, Billy, try...

Billy tries, but can't talk.

The other Acutes are bored, restive, waiting.

McMurphy has ants in his pants as Big Nurse speaks to Billy.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Was it your idea to visit her on
	Sunday?

			BILLY
	Y-y-y-yes...

			BIG NURSE
	Tell us about it...

			BILLY
	I-I-I-I c-c-c-came over S-S-S
	Sunday m-m-m-morning after ch-ch-ch
	church and br-br-brought her s-s
	some flowers, and I s-s-said, I
	said, 'C-C-C-Celia, will you muh
	muh-muh-muh-muh...' till the girl
	broke out l-l-laughing.

Billy laughs at himself.

			BIG NURSE
	What was it about her that
	disturbed you so, Billy?

			BILLY
		(rubbing scars on his
		wrist)
	I was in luh-love with her.

			BIG NURSE
	Billy, were you afraid of her, or
	of her love?

No response from Billy.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	That was the first time you
	attempted to commit suicide, wasn't
	it?
		(no response)
	You must try to talk about it,
	Billy.

			MCMURPHY
	Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want
	to talk, so get off his back an'
	let's get on to some new business.

			BIG NURSE 
	Mister McMurphy, the purpose of
	this meeting is therapy. Group
	therapy.

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah, yeah, the hell with that
	crap! The World Series is goin' on
	right' now an' that's therapy also!

			BIG NURSE 
	Let me pose a question to the
	group: do any of you feel that
	Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing
	his personal desires on you too
	much?

			MCMURPHY
	What the hell does that have to do
	with it? This is an important event
	and I want a vote on it!

			CHESWICK
	Yeah, let's vote on it!

			BIG NURSE
	Will one more vote satisfy you?

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah, it'll satisfy me.

			BIG NURSE 
	Very well. What is it you're
	proposing, Mister McMurphy?

			MCMURPHY
	I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin'
	the ballgame!

			BIG NURSE 
		(to the patients)
	A vote is before the group.

			MCMURPHY
	Okay, I wanna see the hands. I
	wanna see which of you birds has
	any guts.

			BIG NURSE 
	Everyone in favor of changing the
	schedule raise his hand.

The first hand to come up is Cheswick's. Then McMurphy's.
Then Martini, Scanlon, Sefelt, Fredrickson, Billy and Taber.

Harding doesn't vote.

Big Nurse starts counting the hands.

McMurphy, his face beaming, counts the hands.

			MCMURPHY
	That's it! We made it!

			BIG NURSE
	I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count
	only eight.

			MCMURPHY
	So do I!

			BIG NURSE 
	But there are eighteen patients on
	the ward, Mister McMurphy.

			MCMURPHY
		(the light dawning)
	You mean to tell me you're gonna
	count those old birds over there?

			BIG NURSE 
	I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you
	must have a majority to change ward
	policy.

			MCMURPHY
	Well, I'll be a son-of-a-bitch...

			BILLY
	B-But, M-M-Miss R-Ratched, y-you n
	never c-c-counted th-their votes
	before!

A beat.

			BIG NURSE
		(losing ground)
	You mean you don't want their votes
	to count, Billy!

			BILLY
	I-I-I...

			MCMURPHY
	Well, screw that noise!

McMurphy rises and, taking his chair, he crosses toward the
television set.

			BIG NURSE
	Sit down, Mister McMurphy!

McMurphy turns the TV on, flips the channel, then sits and
waits for a picture.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	I want you to turn the television
	off and return to your place!

A picture swirls onto the TV screen. The ballgame is in
progress (documentary footage to be used).

Martini rushes over and joins McMurphy. Scanlon follows hot
on his heels as --

			MCMURPHY
	Hoo-wee! Man, all I need me now is
	a can of beer and a red-hot.

Cheswick gets up and starts across when --

			BIG NURSE
	Sit down, Mister Cheswick.

Cheswick stops and stands there, helpless to move.

			CHESWICK
	Mack...

McMurphy is deep into the game.

INSERT - TV SCREEN

On the screen a great play is taking place, and at the
breathtaking moment the TV picture swirls into a little eye
of light -- then nothing.

BACK TO SCENE

The Acutes are left with their mouths hanging open.

			BIG NURSE (V.O.)
		(over loudspeaker)
	I want you men to return to your
	proper places. The group meeting is
	not over!

McMurphy continues looking at the blank TV screen as the
Acutes look from McMurphy to Big Nurse, not knowing what to
do next when --

			MCMURPHY
		(jumping up and shouting
		at the blank TV screen)
	A hit! It's a hit! He's rounding
	first, heading for second. Here
	comes the throw. He's sliding...
	and... he's safe! He's safe!
		(McMurphy whistles and
		claps his hands)
	Hoo-wee! Whatta game! Whatta game!
	Come on, Koufax! Strike 'em out!

The Acutes are stunned at McMurphy's outburst.

			BIG NURSE (V.O.)
		(over loudspeaker)
	Mister McMurphy, you are
	deliberately violating the
	rules!...

			MCMURPHY
	He's into his wind-up. Here comes
	the pitch. Strike on the inside
	corner!

Sefelt, Fredrickson, Billy and Taber get up and cross toward
the TV. Harding is the only one who doesn't join them.

			BIG NURSE (V.O.)
		(over loudspeaker)
	You men remain seated!

			MCMURPHY
		(focusing in on TV screen)
	He's into his wind-up. Here's the
	next pitch... and it's a hit! It's
	a hit!

			MARTINI
		(jumping up and down)
	I saw thum! I saw thum!

			SCANLON
	Me, too! Me, too!

			SEFELT
	Yes, I see it! I see it!

			MCMURPHY
		(on his feet, shouting)
	Ya-hoo, let's'play ball!

The other Acutes pick up on McMurphy and start shouting at
the blank TV screen.

			ACUTES
	Ya-hoo! 
	It's a hit! 
	A triple! 
	It's a home run! 
	A double! 
	He's out! 
	Whadaya blind? 
	He's safe by a mile! 
		(AD LIB)

			BIG NURSE (V.O.)
		(over loudspeaker)
	You boys, stop this and go to your
	assignments! Mister McMurphy, I
	want you to set an example...

			MCMURPHY
	'Kay, it's two outs, bases loaded
	as Koufax steps up to the mound...
	Checks the runners... goes into his
	wind-up... Here comes the three-two
	pitch... And it's a fly ball into
	deep center. Mantle is going back.
	He's going back! Back! His back is
	up against the wall... and... he
	catches it! He catches it!

The Acutes are shouting, cheering, stomping and dancing in
each other's arms.

			BIG NURSE'S VOICE
		(over loudspeaker)
	You men stop this! Mister
	Washington! Miller! Warren!

Big Nurse's last words overload the intercom and the system
peaks out. Big Nurse's mouth continues to work in frantic
circles as Washington, Miller and Warren rush to quell the
uproar.

INT. SPIVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

Doctor Spivey is seated behind his desk, looking over
McMurphy's papers.

McMurphy sits facing him.

			SPIVEY
	How are you feeling?

			MCMURPHY
	Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think
	I might've put on a couple of
	pounds since I got here.

			SPIVEY
	Good, good, and how are you getting
	along on the ward?

			MCMURPHY
	Come on, Doc, you know as well as I
	do what's been comin' down in that
	loony bin.

			SPIVEY 
	Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that
	you're a disturbing influence on
	the other patients.

			MCMURPHY
	Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm
	disturbing is that old nurse and
	her fixed ways. That's all.

			SPIVEY 
	Yes, that may be so, but in making
	a careful study of your past
	record, along with your behavior
	since you arrived here, my feeling
	is that you are not mentally ill
	and it is going to be my
	recommendation that you be returned
	to Pendleton where they are better
	equipped to handle your case.

This is the kiss of death to McMurphy.

			MCMURPHY
	Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'.

			SPIVEY
	I'm afraid not.

			MCMURPHY
	Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my
	ass in a sling, don't she!

			SPIVEY 
	No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that
	we cannot offer you the guidance
	and assistance that you would
	receive at Pendleton.

			MCMURPHY
	Guidance and assistance! That's
	insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.

			SPIVEY 
	I'm sorry, but I can't keep you
	here.

			MCMURPHY
	When?

			SPIVEY
	We'll let you know.

REACTION SHOT of McMurphy.

EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY

Washington and Warren are sitting on the grass watching
Martini, Scanlon, Harding and Billy, who are positioned on
the court waiting on McMurphy who is under the board with
Bromden.

Cheswick and the other patients hang around off court as:

			MCMURPHY
		(with great physical and
		vocal emphasis throughout
		entire scene)
	Okay, Chief. This is your spot! I
	don't want you to move from this
	spot! Never!... 'Kay, now, take the
	ball! Raise your hands, like
	this...

McMurphy raises his hands above his head. Bromden follows
suit.

			MCMURPHY
	That's good! That's a good boy,
	Chief! Now jump and put it in!

McMurphy jumps. Bromden doesn't. McMurphy does this a couple
of times. Each time Bromden remains motionless.

			HARDING
	He can't hear you!

			MCMURPHY
	I know, goddammit! You don't have
	ta tell me that!

			HARDING 
	So why are you talking to him?

			MCMURPHY
	I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin'
	to myself! It helps me think!

			HARDING 
	It doesn't help him.

			MCMURPHY
	Well, it doesn't hurt him either!
		(turning to Bromden)
	Does it, Chief!
		(no response)
	See, it doesn't hurt him.
		(to Bromden)
	Jump! An' put it in!

McMurphy jumps. Bromden doesn't move.

			HARDING
	Well, I think you're just confusing
	him...

Bromden jumps.

			MCMURPHY
	Ha! Did ya see that!
		(calling to Cheswick on
		the sidelines)
	Hey, Cheswick!

			CHESWICK
	Yeah, Mack?

			MCMURPHY
	Come here!

Cheswick runs over.

			CHESWICK
	Yeah, Mack?

			MCMURPHY
	Let me get on your shoulders.

			CHESWICK 
	Sure, Mack...

McMurphy climbs on his shoulders.

			MCMURPHY
	'Kay, wheel me around to the
	basket... 'Kay, easy, easy. Hold
	it! 'Kay, now.
		(he sees Bromden has
		walked away)
	Hey, Chief, come back!

Bromden doesn't hear.

			MCMURPHY
	Cheswick, go get 'im!

Cheswick goes after Bromden, catches him, and McMurphy
latches onto him.

			MCMURPHY
	Now, wheel me to the basket.

Cheswick, straining under the weight of McMurphy, turns
toward the basket.

INT. MEN'S DORM - NIGHT

as Bromden, chewing his gum, watches McMurphy ease his way
out of bed and silently cross down the aisle, past the sleep
patients, toward the day room.

INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT

as McMurphy crosses the day room, past the nurses' station
where Turkle is asleep.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

as McMurphy crosses down the hallway and stops at the mess
hall door. He tries the handle. The door is locked. McMurphy
looks up at the open transom, ponders it, then jumps up and
grabs the door lintel. He tries to lift himself up, but can't
make it when suddenly he is lifted up to the level of the
transom by Bromden.

McMurphy worms his way through the transom and disappears
down the other side.

CAMERA HOLDS on Bromden who waits. A long beat. There is a
strange HUMMING SOUND HEARD O.S. Another beat, then the door
opens.

McMurphy smiles at Bromden.

			MCMURPHY
		(pointing to the floor)
	Wait here, Chief.
		(more to himself as he
		starts down hall)
	Heh, heh, I'll show 'em who's
	crazy.

INT. MEN'S DORM - NIGHT

McMurphy is nudging Cheswick awake.

			MCMURPHY
	Hey, Cheswick! Wake up!

			CHESWICK
		(waking up)
	Yeah, Mack, what is it?

			MCMURPHY
	I'm leaving. Goodbye!

			CHESWICK
		(sitting up)
	Where ya goin', Mac?

			MCMURPHY
	Shhh...

McMurphy turns and crosses to Billy.

			MCMURPHY
		(waking Billy)
	Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and
	say goodbye to your ol' buddy.

			BILLY
		(waking up)
	W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?

			MCMURPHY
	So long, kid.

			BILLY
	Wh-wh-wh-wh...

			MCMURPHY
	Shhh...

McMurphy turns from the bewildered Billy and crosses to
Martini.

			MCMURPHY
		(nudging Martini awake)
	Psst! Hey, Martini, wake up!

			MARTINI
		(waking up)
	Yeah, Mac?

			MCMURPHY
	Bye-bye.

McMurphy turns to Scanlon.

			MCMURPHY
	Scanlon! Hey, Scanlon, wake up!

			SCANLON
		(waking up)
	Yeah, what's up?

			MCMURPHY
	Shhhh. See ya around the ball park.

McMurphy crosses to Fredrickson and wakes him.

			FREDRICKSON
		(waking up)
	What? What?

			MCMURPHY
	So long, Freddy. Don't take any
	wooden nickles.

			FREDRICKSON
		(sitting up)
	What?

			MCMURPHY
	Shhh...

The other patients are sitting up, some of them getting out
of bed as McMurphy turns to Sefelt who is snoring. McMurphy
pinches his nose and Sefelt wakes up.

			MCMURPHY
	Bye-bye, pussy cat.

McMurphy crosses to Taber.

			MCMURPHY
		(waking Taber)
	Up an' at 'em, Taber.

			TABER
		(waking up)
	What's going on?

			MCMURPHY
	Shhhh. Time to say goodbye.

McMurphy turns and crosses to Harding.

			MCMURPHY
	Hey, Hard-on. Wake up, Dumbo.

Harding opens his eyes and looks at McMurphy.

			MCMURPHY (CONT'D)
	Ya owe me twenty-five bucks.

			HARDING
	What for?

			MCMURPHY
	I'm busting outta this place.

			HARDING 
	That's nice. Send me a post card.

Harding turns his back to McMurphy.

			MCMURPHY
		(turning to the others who
		have gathered around)
	So long suckers.

			BILLY
	Wh-wh-where ya going, M-M-Mac?

			CHESWICK
	How ya gettin' out, Mac?

			MCMURPHY
	Shhh... That's for me to know an'
	you to find out.

			TABER
	Bullshit. You ain't got no way out!

			MCMURPHY
	Oh, yeah?

			TABER
	Yeah!

			MCMURPHY
	How much ya wanna bet?

			TABER (CONT'D)
	Ten bucks.

			MCMURPHY
	You're on.
		(to the others)
	Let's go! An' keep it quiet.

McMurphy starts down the aisle. The others follow.

INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT

as McMurphy and the other patients cross the day room, past
the nurses' station, where Turkle shifts in his sleep.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

as McMurphy and the patients cross down the hallway and enter
the mess hall followed by Bromden.

INT. MESS HALL - NIGHT

Cheswick, Bromden, Martini, Scanlon, Sefelt, Fredrickson,
Billy, Taber and McMurphy, stand looking at the dumbwaiter.

			BILLY
	Wh-wh-what's d-d-down th-there, M-M
	Mac?

			TABER
	Where's it go?

			MCMURPHY
	Out. It's the way out. So just keep

Several of the others chime in.

			MCMURPHY
	Shhh!

INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT

The patients are waiting in the tunnel, which is used as an
underground connecting system to the institutional buildings,
as McMurphy gets out of the dumbwaiter.

			MCMURPHY
		(looking around)
	Where's Martini and Scanlon?

			CHESWICK
		(pointing)
	They went that way.

			MCMURPHY
	Charlie, ya can't ever let those
	goons outta ya sight! Understand!

			CHESWICK
	Right, Mack!

Far down the tunnel Martini and Scanlon are briefly SEEN as
they skitter across the tunnel.

			SEFELT
	There they are!

			MCMURPHY
	Hey, Martini! Psst! Scanlon! Ya
	dumb goons, come back here!
		(starting after them)
	Come on, let's get 'em!

McMurphy starts down the tunnel. The others don't move.

			MCMURPHY
		(calling back)
	Come on, you guys, let's stick
	together.

The Acutes follow McMurphy. They run down to the intersection
and turn the corner.

No sign of Martini or Scanlon.

Somewhere a DOOR is HEARD SLAMMING CLOSED and FOOTSTEPS are
HEARD coming their way.

			TABER
	Somebody's coming!

			MCMURPHY
	Shhh!
		(he listens then)
	This way!

McMurphy hustles the men round the corner as two aides
pushing a gurney come wheeling by.

			BILLY
	I-I-I th-th-think we sh-sh-should
	go back!

			SEFELT
	Yeah, my feet are gettin' cold.

			FREDRICKSON
	Mine, too!

			MCMURPHY
	We'll go back just as soon as we
	find those guys! 'Kay?

			ACUTES
		(simultaneously)
	'Kay, Mack!

The band takes off down tbe tunnel, calling out in loud
whispers, "Martini! Scanlon! Psst! Where are you?"

Down one tunnel and up another -- till they turn a corner and
see an open door.

They go to the door and peer out. Steps lead up to the
outside world.

			MCMURPHY
	They must be up there!

			CHESWICK
	Yeah!

			BILLY
	L-L-Let-'s go b-back!

Several Acutes express the same desire.

			MCMURPHY
	Come on, don't crap out on me now.
	We got two buddies out there!

			BILLY (CONT'D)
	I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R
	Ratched g-g-g-g...

			MCMURPHY
	Fuck Miss Ratched!

McMurphy crosses out and up the stairs.

The Acutes look at each other. A beat, then:

			MCMURPHY (O.S.)
	Wow! Look at this!

The Acutes don't move.

			MCMURPHY (O.S.)
	Hey, you guys, come on up here and
	take a gander at this!

The Acutes inch their way out the door and up the steps.

EXT. INSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS - NIGHT

as the Acutes join McMurphy to see the moon low in the sky,
silhouetting the trees and buildings, and Martini chasing

Scanlon across the wet grounds.

			CHESWICK
	There they are!

			MCMURPHY
		(his attention elsewhere)
	Hey, what's that?

			SEVERAL ACUTES
		(simultaneously)
	What? Where?

			MCMURPHY
		(pointing)
	Over there!

			SEFELT
		(squinting)
	I don't know...

			BILLY
	I-i-it's a b-b-bus!

			MCMURPHY
	A bus?

			BILLY (CONT'D)
	Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!

			MCMURPHY
	Well, shoot, man! Whadaya say we
	take ourselves a little spin around
	the place.

			TABER
	We'll get in trouble...

			CHESWICK
	Yeah, maybe we ought to go back,
	Mac...

			FREDRICKSON
	Yeah, my feet are cold...

			SEFELT
	My feet hurt...

			BILLY
	I-I-I'm w-w-wet...

			MCMURPHY
		(walking towards the bus)
	Go ahead! Go back!

The Acutes cast frightened looks at each other then go after
McMurphy. Martini and Scanlon join them.

			BILLY (CONT'D)
	H-H-How d-d-do we g-g-get b-back?

McMurphy has reached the bus and begins checking it out.

			TABER
	Yeah, take us back to the
	dumbwaiter, Mac.

			MCMURPHY
	I'm not going back in there. I told
	ya this was a one way trip. Now
	stand aside.

McMurphy lifts the hood to the bus and begins jumping the
wire. The Acutes stand helplessly by as the engine turns over
and catches. McMurphy closes the hood and gets on the bus to
a chorus of, "Please, Mac, take us back... Please..."
McMurphy puts the bus in gear and the bus starts moving. The
Acutes start running alongside of the bus calling out for
McMurphy to take them back.

			MCMURPHY
		(shouting to them)
	Get on assholes!

They leap on.

EXT. INSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT

As the bus makes a full circle and stops alongside of
Bromden.

			MCMURPHY
		(waving Bromden onto the
		bus)
	Come on, Chief! Let's go!

Bromden boards the bus. McMurphy lets out a war whoop as he
closes the door and starts the bus moving.

EXT. INSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS - NIGHT

as the bus picks up speed and churns across the grounds.

INT. BUS - NIGHT

the Acutes look out with wild-eyed excitement.

EXT. INSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS - NIGHT

as the bus careens out the main entrance and down the
thoroughfare.

INT. BUS - NIGHT

as the Acutes cast worried looks at each other.

EXT. HIGHWAY

as the bus turns a corner past a sign that reads: 

DALLES 6, SALMON CREEK 8, DEPOE BAY 11, CAPE LOOKOUT 22,
PORTLAND 46

INT. BUS - NIGHT

McMurphy is singing at the top of his lungs.

			MCMURPHY
		(singing)
	Your horses are hungry,
	That's what she did say,
	Come sit down beside me,
	An' feed them some hay.
	My horses ain't hungry,
	They wontt eat your hay-ay-aeee...

			BILLY
	H-Hey, M-Mack.

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah, kid?

			BILLY 
	W-W-Where we g-g-going?

			CHESWICK
	Yeah, where we going?

			MCMURPHY
	I dunno. Where do ya wanna go?

			MARTINI
	I wanna go home!

			SCANLON
	Yeah, it's cold!

			MARTINI
	I'm hungry.

			TABER
	Yeah, we'll miss breakfast!

			MCMURPHY
	Breakfast! Hell, I know just the
	place where we can chow down an'
	thaw out before we shoot back on
	home. 'Kay?

			BILLY
	'K-Kay, M-Mack!

	Soo, fare-the-weel, darlin'.
	I'm gone on my way,
	My wagons are loaded,

EXT. DEPOE BAY - DAWN

The dawn is just cracking the horizon as the bus pulls up
behind a corroded tin sheet building. A sign reads: 

DEPOE BAY, SEAMANIS SERVICE, SPORT FISHING, BOATS FOR CHARTER

Beyond the boathouse is the dock with several fishing
trawlers and beyond that -- the open sea.

The door to the bus opens and McMurphy gets out.

			MCMURPHY
		(as he steps out of the
		bus)
	This is it!

as McMurphy walks directly to the wall, alongside the door,
lifts the edge of the siding, comes up with a key, opens the
door and enters.

A beat, then the lights go on inside the building.

SHOT OF BUS

The Acutes' faces pressed against the windows, looking out.

INT. SEAMAN'S BUILDING - DAWN

as McMurphy lifts a cold bottle of beer out of a Coca-Cola
cooler, opens it, takes a long pull on the bottle, then
crosses to the heater and turns it on.

Nearby, a sign reads: ALL EQUIPMENT CAN BE RENTED

On the walls are old photographs of people with their prize
catches. Fishing equipment, tackle and wet weather gear crowd
the room.

There is a counter which McMurphy walks behind and takes a
bag of potato chips off a wall rack, full of beer nuts,
hostess cupcakes, etc.

McMurphy eyes the keyboard to the fishing boats. Several keys
are there.

INSERT - KEYBOARD

with the names of the fishing boats: The Lark. Mary Ann.
Noel. Annabella. The Capri.

INT. BUILDING DEPOE BAY - DAWN

McMurphy studying the board as the Acutes stick their heads
in the door. They're all miserable and cold.

			MCMURPHY
	Come on in an' warm up. You can put
	some of that gear on to keep warm.
	An' there's beer an' Coke in the
	cooler an' some food over here...

They hesitate.

			MCMURPHY
	Come on, don't be shy now, you're
	among friends.

The Acutes come in, Bromden bringing up the rear.

Martini goes for the candy. Scanlon goes for the Coke. Sefelt
and Fredrickson go for the wet weather gear and boots. The
others go to the heater. Bromden stands in the middle of the
room.

			MCMURPHY
	Why don't one of you boys help ol'
	Chief there get warmed up?

Billy goes to Bromden's aid as McMurphy crosses to a window
and looks out.

McMurphy turns and looks out the window. A long beat.

			CHESWICK
	When do you think we'll be going
	back, Mack?

			MCMURPHY
		(looking out the window)
	Come here a minute, Cheswick. You,
	too, Sefelt. Hey, all you guys,
	come over here, I wanna show you
	somethin'.

The Acutes cross to the window and look out, saying, "What?
What is it? Whadaya lookin' at? I don't see a thing."

			MARTINI
	Oh, look at the pretty boat.

ACUTES' POV

Nestled against the dock is a trim fishing trawler,
beautifully framed in the bay window.

			MCMURPHY (V.O.)
	Yeah, did you ever see a boat like
	that? Why, I'll bet you could go
	all the way to Hawaii in that boat!
	Tahiti... the Philippines...
	Tibet...

CAMERA HOLDS on FULL SHOT of the boat.

BACK TO SCENE

A long beat, then we SEE the Acutes, wearing wet weather
gear, complete with boots and squall hats, each man carrying
soda pop, food, fishing equipment, etc., being led onto the
boat by McMurphy who carries a case of beer.

EXT. FISHING BOAT - DAWN

as a white gorge of smoke and water pours from the stern and
the boat pulls away from the dock, leaving a boiling foam of
water.

INT. SHIP'S BRIDGE - DAWN

The entire crew is jammed into the bridge, McMurphy behind
the wheel.

McMURPHY'S POV

as the dock and other fishing boats slip by.

EXT. HARBOR JETTY - DAWN

as the boat passes out of the harbor and heads for the open
sea.

					DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. BOAT DECK - DAY

The sun is up. The engine is dead. The ballgame is HEARD OVER
ship's RADIO. The men are scattered over the boat. Taber and
McMurphy, beer in hand, are sunning themselves, listening to
the ballgame. On the stern Martini and Scanlon are trying to
rig up a pole. Fredrickson gives them a hand. Billy has a
line out. So does Bromden and Sefelt who is seated nearby,
fishing the ocean floor when he suddenly gets a bite and
looks over the side, surprised. His line goes straight down
into the depths. His glasses fall off into the water. Sefelt
sighs and slowly begins reeling his line in.

Billy gets a strike and starts fighting the fish.

			BILLY
	H-H-Help!

			MCMURPHY
	Ease up on the star drag, keep the
	tie up, up and work hell outta that
	fella.

Martini gets a strike and loses it. Scanlon comes up and
starts to take the pole from him.

			SCANLON
	My turn.

			MARTINI
		(hanging onto the pole)
	No.

They start a tug of war. Fredrickson tries to break it up,
when he gets a strike and his line spins out.

Billy's fish breaks into the sun in a shower of silver
scales, and he gets so excited he lets the end of the pole go
down and the line snaps.

			MCMURPHY
	Up, I told you! Keep that tip up...
	up! You had you one big silver
	there.

Fredrickson lands his salmon in a spray of scales and blood.

The fish is flopping all over the deck. Billy grabs the fish
and wrestles it down.

Bromden lands a fish when --

			SEFELT (O.S.)
	Oh, my God! I see something!

Everyone rushes over to Sefelt and looks down into the water.

REVERSE SHOT

Deep down in the water a gigantic white form slowly rises out
of the depths, becoming solid, alive.

			SCANLON
	Jesus God...

			MARTINI
	What is it?

			FREDRICKSON
	We'll never get that on the boat.

The fish is now clearly SEEN.

			BILLY
		(calling)
	M-M-Mack! M-M-Mack!

McMurphy pulls himself up.

			MCMURPHY
	What is it, kid?

			BILLY 
	C-C-Come here and l-look at th
	this!

McMurphy crosses down and looks over the side.

			MCMURPHY
	He's a big flounder. Could weigh
	two, three hundred. You got to lift
	him in with a winch.

			FREDRICKSON
	Does that mean we have to cut him
	loose?

			MCMURPHY
	Like hell we will! We got the
	muscle standing right here. All we
	need is a couple gaffin' hooks and
	some rope.

			BILLY
	I-I-I'll get them.

			MARTINI
	Me, too.

			SCANLON
	Me, too.

McMurphy turns to Sefelt who is sweating under the strain.

			MCMURPHY
	Steady does it, Sefelt!

SEFELT'S POV

The massive fish is closer to the surface.

					DISSOLVE TO:

BACK TO SCENE

All the men are standing by as gaffing hooks and rope are
made ready. The fish is gaffed and slowly hauled out of the
water.

McMurphy and Bromden lean over, held by the others, grab the
big fish by its gills and, with a heave-ho, the fish is slid
in and flopped to the bottom of the boat. The men go
sprawling over the big fish. There's a lot of laughter,
handshakes and back-slapping going on when --

			VOICE
		(over bull horn)
	All right! Stand to! Stand to!

The men look up.

REVERSE SHOT - ACUTES' POV

Off the bow is a Coast Guard cutter, and on the deck stands
Doctor Spivey, Washington, Warren and several other aides
dressed in white.

INT. HALLWAY - STATE HOSPITAL - LATE AFTERNOON

as the Acutes, sunburned and covered with dried brine and
fish scales, are escorted down the hallway by Washington,
Warren and Doctor Spivey.

It's a triumphant procession as they wheel the giant flounder
with a sheet over it on a gurney, holding up their catches
for all to see.

McMurphy is lagging a bit behind as they pass the mess hall
where workmen are busy installing a security screen over the
transom, while inside the mess hall another workman is SEEN
welding a lock on the dumbwaiter.

INT. DAY ROOM

as Big Nurse steps out of the Nurses' Station.

			SPIVEY
		(to Big Nurse)
	Here they are, Miss Ratched. Safe
	and sound!

			BIG NURSE
	Good. Well, boys, did you enjoy
	yourselves?

A burst of exuberance as the inmates hold up their fish.

			FREDRICKSON
		(to Sefelt)
	Show her the one you caught, Jim.

Sefelt whips the sheet off the big fish.

			BIG NURSE
	My, my...

No one can find superlatives or gestures big enough to
describe his catching of the big fish, "brought it in
himself" AD LIB.

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah, ya should've come along with
	us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a
	little sun on your cheeks and maybe
	caught a fish or two.

			BIG NURSE
	Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to
	take these men out with you!

			MCMURPHY
		(loudly)
	Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't
	it!

			BIG NURSE
	No, it was irresponsible!

Big Nurse turns to the others, leaving McMurphy dangling.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
		(respectfully)
	That's quite a catch, Jim. Whaat
	are you going to do with it?

			MARTINI
		(crossing to McMurphy)
	Gimme a cigarette!

			SEFELT
	I thought I might donate it to the
	mess hall.

			MCMURPHY
		(reaches in his pocket; he
		has none)
	I don't have any.

AD LIBS: "They could use it." "Take a picture first."

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	That's an excellent idea. Now, why
	don't you boys place your fish on
	the gurney and we'll see to it that
	everyone enjoys a fresh fish
	dinner.

The men toss their fish on the gurney as Martini joins the
group and starts hitting the others up for a cigarette. All
he gets for his troubles are a series of "No," "Get lost," "I
don't have any."

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Thank you, boys. Now if you'll just
	go along with Mister Washington to
	the showers, supper is in half an
	hour.

The inmates start AD LIBBING and laughing, "We're not
hungry," as Martini sees Harding light up a cigarette and
crosses to him.

			MARTINI
		(to Harding)
	Gimme a cigarette!

			HARDING
	No!

			MARTINI
	Why not?

			HARDING
	I'm not running a charity ward...

Martini snaps the cigarette out of Harding's hand, and takes
off with Harding chasing him.

Martini dashes around the room, pulling chairs in Harding's
way, taking a drag on the cigarette whenever he can.

Harding corners Martini, but Martini tosses the cigarette
over Harding's head to Scanlon.

Scanlon takes off with Harding after him, absolutely livid.

Scanlon passes to Billy who passes to Martini. Everyone in
the room is getting wired.

Martini throws it away as Harding jumps him and nails him to
the floor.

			MARTINI
		(holding his hands up;
		empty)
	All gone! All gone! Don't hit!
	Don't hit!

Harding starts pounding Martini's head on the floor when
Billy and Scanlon jump Harding and start pounding him.

Fredrickson picks up the cigarette and stands there watching
the fight as he smokes the cigarette as Washington, Warren
and Miller move in and start separating the men.

McMurphy, watching the fight, sighs, then deliberately
crosses toward the Nurses' Station.

INT. NURSES' STATION - MISS PILBOW'S POV - DAY

as McMurphy reaches the Nurses' Station and puts his hand
through the plate glass window, his fist stopping inches from
Miss Pilbow's startled face. Miss Pilbow's scream is added to
the SOUND OF THE SHATTERED WINDOW.

INT. DAY ROOM - DAY

McMurphy reaches in and picks up his carton of cigarettes.

			MCMURPHY
	I'm sure sorry, ma'am. Gawd, but I
	am. That window glass was so clean
	I didn't even see it...

McMurphy turns and crosses back to the day room, opening the
carton of cigarettes as he goes.

			MCMURPHY
	You guys want cigarettes! Here's
	the goddamn cigarettes!

McMurphy starts tossing packages of cigarettes into the mass
of struggling bodies as Washington grabs McMurphy by the arm
and tries to wheel him away.

McMurphy shakes him off and throws a pack of cigarettes in
Washington's face.

Washington goes after McMurphy, grabs him, and drives him
against the wall, right next to Bromden, who watches as
McMurphy shoves Washington away, goes into a crouch and
starts circling Washington. Washington dances in and out,
chipping away at McMurphy's face until McMurphy drives his
fist square into Washington's white, starched chest, drawing
him against the wall.

McMurphy moves in for the kill.

			WASHINGTON
	Warren! Miller!

The Acutes have stopped fighting and are watching.

McMurphy tags Washington, then is grabbed from behind by
Warren, who pulls him back.

Washington moves in and goes to work on McMurphy, when
Bromden grabs Washington, from behind, in a bear hug.

Miller jumps on Bromden's back. Bromden, still holding
Washington, backs up into the wall, squashing Miller, who
screams out.

EXT. HALLWAY TO DISTURBANCE WARD - LATE AFTERNOON

as McMurphy, bruised from the fight, and Bromden, handcuffed
to a special belt, wait while an aide unlocks the first of a
double set of heavy security doors.

The first door is locked, leaving McMurphy, Bromden, and the
three aides crammed in the small space between the two doors
while another aide opens the second door and McMurphy and
Bromden step through, followed by the aides.

INT. DISTURBANCE WARD - LATE AFTERNOON

As the aide locks the door behind them, the other aides lead
Bromden and McMurphy toward a bench, where they unshackle
them.

			AIDE
		(pointing to a bench)
	Wait over there...

The three aides go down the hall, leaving McMurphy and
Bromden who sit and look at their new surroundings. There is
a man sitting next to them.

McMURPHY'S POV

The architecture is the same as the ward we left below, but
it is the atmosphere that is different. A heaviness pervades
all. Heavily sedated patients sit isolated from each other.
Others stand shifting from one foot to the other, while
others walk up and down the hallway, their locomotive powers
not unlike that of Parkinson's Disease (caused by too much
sedation).

Suddenly, one patient gets up, speaking very angrily,
shouting incoherently at no one; he crosses the hall and
enters a side room. An aide goes in after him. A long beat,
then the aide comes out with the patient and gently leads him
back to his seat, talking softly to the man.

Further down the hallway, a gurney is wheeled out of the east
room with a patient lying on it, out cold; he is wheeled
further down the hall to the men's dorms, where he is left to
sleep it off.

Two aides come out of the EST room and head in McMurphy's
direction, where one of the aides motions to the patient
sitting next to McMurpby.

			AIDE (CONT'D)
		(approaching him very
		gently)
	Come on, Joey... this isn't going
	to hurt you... good for you... make
	you feel better...

The patient clings to the bench, terrified, weeping.

The aides peel him off the bench and escort him down the hall
to the EST room.

ANOTHER ANGLE

As McMurphy watches the patient go, he takes out a package of
gum. Takes a stick for himself and gives Bromden one.
McMurphy turns back to his own thoughts.

			BROMDEN
	Thank you.

McMurphy looks up. A long beat.

			MCMURPHY
	Say it again.

			BROMDEN
	Thank you.

Another beat.

			MCMURPHY
	Say... God Bless America!

			BROMDEN
	God Bless America.

			MCMURPHY
		(slapping his thigh)
	Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch!
	Does anybody else know?

			BROMDEN 
	No.

			MCMURPHY
	Shit! This is too much!
		(his mind going a mile a
		minute)
	Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust
	outta this place an' make it all
	the way to Canada before they know
	what bit 'em.

			BROMDEN 
	Ca-na-da...

			MCMURPHY
	Ya like that, Chief, huh?

			BROMDEN
	Yeah...

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah, well, well, well. 'Bout time
	the rest of the world got a gander
	at Big Chief Bromden cuttin' down
	the boulevard, stopping just long
	enough for virgins... Oh, man, I
	tell you, I tell you, you'll have
	women trippin' you and beating you
	to the floor...

			BROMDEN
	Ca-na-da...

			MCMURPHY
	Shhh, Chief, don't talk. Never
	talk! Remember, this is just
	between you an' me. Do ya
	understand?

Bromden nods.

			NURSE ITSU (O.S.)
	Mister McMurphy.

McMurphy turns to see Nurse Itsu. The two aides are standing
behind her.

			MCMURPHY
		(recognizing a long-lost
		friend)
	Hey, how ya doin'?

			NURSE ITSU
	Fine, thank you.
		(offering pills)
	Here, please take these.

			MCMURPHY
	What are they?

			NURSE ITSU
	To help you relax... please...

McMurphy takes the pills and downs them. Bromden takes his
pills.

			NURSE ITSU (CONT'D)
	Please take off your shoes.

McMurphy takes off his shoes.

			NURSE ITSU (CONT'D)
	Please follow me.

			MCMURPHY
		(rising, thumbs up)
	You an' me, Chief.

McMurphy, flanked by the two aides, follows Nurse Itsu to the
EST room.

			MCMURPHY
		(to Itsu)
	You know, I never got your name.

			NURSE ITSU
		(stopping at the door)
	Miss Itsu.
		(indicating the room)
	In here, please.

			MCMURPHY
	You comin' in to hold my hand?

			NURSE ITSU
	No...

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah... Well, see ya around, Itsu.

Itsu smiles at McMurphy.

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah...

McMurphy gives Bromden one last wave and goes in.

Bromden watches the door close behind McMurphy.

INT. EST ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

There are four other aides in there, standing around an empty
gurney.

A DOCTOR is at the head of the gurney, a NURSE alongside of
him.

			MCMURPHY
		(as he enters)
	Hi...

McMurphy looks around at the six aides.

			MCMURPHY
	You boys can take a cigarette break
	now...

The Nurse smiles at him.

			DOCTOR
	That's all right, Mister McMurphy,
	just climb on the bed and lie
	down...

			MCMURPHY
	Whatever you say, Doc...

McMurphy climbs on the bed and lies down.

The Doctor moves around to the side of the bed and takes
McMurphy's pulse, while the Nurse dips her fingers into a jar
of salve.

			DOCTOR
		(to McMurphy)
	This won't hurt you at all...

			MCMURPHY
	Uh, uh...

The Nurse starts applying salve to McMurphy's temples.

			MCMURPHY
	What's that for?

			NURSE
	Conductant.

			MCMURPHY
		(smiling up at her)
	Surely, goodness and mercy will
	follow this, eh, honey?

			DOCTOR
		(holding a mouthpiece)
	Please, put this in your mouth...

McMurphy takes the bit in his teeth. The Doctor moves back to
the head of the gurney and places the thongs on McMurphy's
temples.

The Doctor nods to the six aides, who move in and gently
place their hands, in a very professional manner, on
McMurphy's knees, hips and shoulders. Once set, the Doctor
turns to his controls.

SHOT OF McMURPHY

as he looks around, not nearly as scared as he is mystified
by the whole process, when suddenly, without warning,
McMurphy is hit by the shock. His face is a contorted mask of
surprise and pain. His whole body caught in a sudden spasm. A
moment of rigidity, then McMurphy passes out and his body
relaxes. Another moment, then a series of violent body spasms
begin flowing down his body. Now the aides' function is very
clear, as they press down, holding McMurphy firmly to the
gurney, until the last spasm subsides.

FADE IN:

INT. DAY ROOM - DAY

A Group Meeting is in progress. Doctor Spivey is there.

			BIG NURSE
		(to Sefelt)
	It's been brought to my attention
	that you're giving Mister
	Fredrickson your medication, aren't
	you, Mister Sefelt?

			SEFELT
	It's the Dilantin that makes my
	gums soft!

			BIG NURSE
	Now, Jim, you must be honest with
	yourself.

At the end of the hall, the door opens and McMurphy and
Bromden enter the visitors' room, accompanied by Washington
and Warren. They cross to the security gate, open it and pass
into the hallway.

Washington and Warren disappear into a room, leaving McMurphy
and Bromden, who walk slowly towards the day room.

The Group Meeting continues over as Fredrickson raises his
hand.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Yes, Mister Fredrickson?

			FREDRICKSON
	I wanna know why the dorm has to be
	locked in the daytime and on
	weekends?

			TABER
	Yeah, why can't a fellow even have
	the weekends to himself?

			CHESWICK
		(standing up)
	Yeah, whadabout our cigarettes?

			BIG NURSE
	Sit down, Mister Cheswick, and wait
	your turn!

He sits.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	If the dorms were left open, you
	would just return to bed after
	breakfast...

			FREDRICKSON
	So what? Is it a mortal sin? I
	mean, normal people get to sleep
	late on weekends...

			BIG NURSE
	With few exceptions, time spent in
	the company of others is
	therapeutic, while every minute
	spent brooding alone only increases
	separation.

			CHESWICK
		(jumping up as he sees
		McMurphy)
	Mack!

Everyone looks at McMurphy and Bromden.

Bromden is as he always was, as McMurphy slowly drags himself
into the day room. He looks like a zombie as he takes the
room in. Then, suddenly, he slaps his thigh.
	McMURPHY
	Hey, hey, you ding-a-lings, you
	creeps, you goons...

He enters the room doing a jig. The Acutes' faces light up.

			MCMURPHY
	I got ten thousand watts and hot to
	trot. First woman takes me on is
	gonna light up like a pinball
	machine an' pay off in silver
	dollars...

McMurphy does a full circle of the room, greeting the
Chronics. But it's an effort for him. His voice is slower,
his footwork slightly out of sync.

			BILLY
	H-h-how's it g-g-going, Mack?

			MCMURPHY
	Just fine, Billy boy, just fine.
	Full of piss an' vinegar! They
	checked my plugs and cleaned my
	points...

			BIG NURSE
	Mister McMurphy.

			MCMURPHY
		(turning)
	Yes, ma'am?

			BIG NURSE
	Welcome back.

			MCMURPHY
	Thank you, ma'am.

			BIG NURSE
	I hope everything is settled.

			MCMURPHY
	Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy
	dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar
	out of an aide for two weeks! Hi
	ya, Doc!

Spivey greets McMurphy.

			BIG NURSE 
	Good. Why don't you join us?

			MCMURPHY
	Why, thank you, ma'am...
		(he gets a seat and sits
		heavily)
	Whew. Man, I tell you, that place
	up there is somethin' else!
		(pulling it together)
	Well, ya boys been practicin' up
	for the big game?
		(no response)
	I figured as much...

			BILLY
	W-W-We h-heard y-you w-were n-never
	c-c-coming back!

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah, well, let me tell ya
	somethin'... While I was up there
	gettin' in-lightened, I came up
	with one hellava plan...

A great sadness suddenly sweeps over McMurphy's face and he
breaks off.

			BILLY
	Wh-wh-what p-plan, M-Mack!

No response from McMurphy.

			HARDING
	What's your plan, Mack?

			MCMURPHY
		(coming out of it)
	Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan...
	Yeah...

McMurphy gets up and crosses to the window, where he joins
Bromden who is looking out the window.

REACTION SHOT of the others as they look at McMurphy and each
other with quizzical looks.

INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

On the court both teams are lined up taking photographs for
the local newspaper. The bulb pops a few times.

			PHOTOGRAPHER
		(wrapping it up)
	Thank you, boys.

The line breaks up. McMurphy crosses to Big Nurse, who sits
in the front row.

It's the big Saturday game between the Acutes and Aides, as
spectators enter the gymnasium already half-filled with male
and female patients, staff members and visitors.

Doctor Spivey stands nearby at the timers' table, basketball
in hand, whistle around his neck, talking to the timer.

			MCMURPHY
	Miss Ratched, would you please save
	a space for my aunt? She's comin'
	down from Portland.

			BIG NURSE
	Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with
	pleasure.

			MCMURPHY
	Thank you, ma'am...

O.S. the WHISTLE BLOWS.

			MCMURPHY
	Gotta go now, ma'am...

			BIG NURSE
	Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.

			MCMURPHY
	Thank you, ma'am.

McMurphy crosses onto the court. Big Nurse watches him go.

BASKETBALL COURT

Doctor Spivey is at half-court, basketball in hand as the
players take up their positions: Washington faces McMurphy
for the jump at center. Harding and Billy are playing guard
with Warren and Miller on them. Martini and Scanlon are in
the forward position, with the two white Aides covering them.
The other Acutes sit on the bench as substitutes.

			MCMURPHY
		(to Washington)
	Hey, Sam, bet ya two bucks ya lose.

			WASHINGTON
	Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth
	considerin'.

			MCMURPHY
	How 'bout twenty?

			WASHINGTON
	Now you talkin'.

			MCMURPHY
	Bet!

			WASHINGTON
	Bet you ass...

			MCMURPHY
		(to Spivey)
	You're a witness, Doc!

			SPIVEY
	Me? I didn't hear a thing! Let's
	play ball!

Spivey checks the court, then blows the whistle as he tosses
the ball into the air.

Washington taps the ball to Warren, who passes to Miller, who
hands off to Washington, who goes up for a layup. Two points.
The Acutes haven't even moved from their spots. The
scoreboard reads: AIDES 2 PATIENTS 0.

			MCMURPHY
		(taking the ball out)
	Come on, wake up, you ding-a-lings.
	The game is on.

The Acutes snap to and McMurphy passes the ball into Harding,
who fiercely dribbles down court, McMurphy running alongside
him.

			MCMURPHY
	Pass the ball, Harding...
		(no pass)
	Don't hang onto it...
		(no response)
	Pass it, goddammit!

Harding dribbles into the corner and finds himself bottled in
by two Aides.

			MCMURPHY
	Harding, here, over here!

The ball is snagged from Harding's hands by an Aide, who
passes it down court to another Aide, who turns and makes
another basket.

Scoreboard: AIDES 4 PATIENTS 0

			MCMURPHY
		(to Harding)
	Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!

			HARDING
	What are you talking about???
	Everybody was covered!!! Everybody
	was covered!!!

			MCMURPHY
	I was open! Come on, let's play
	ball!

McMurphy and Harding turn to see Martini, down court, passing
the ball into Billy.

			WASHINGTON
		(slapping his hands)
	Gimme tha' ball!

Billy panics and hands the ball to Washington, who turns
around and makes another basket. Score: AIDES 6 PATIENTS 0.

McMurphy and Harding run down court, McMurphy taking the ball
away from Martini, who would like to bring it in.

			MCMURPHY
		(to Washington)
	What kind of crap is that???

			WASHINGTON (CONT'D)
	Jus' playin' the game, sucker...

Washington chuckles and trots on down court.

			MCMURPHY
		(to Martini)
	Get down there where ya belong,
	Martini. You, too, Scanlon.
		(tosses ball to Harding)
	You take it out, Harding!

Harding takes the ball and passes it in to McMurphy, who
turns and dribbles down court exactly like Harding did.

			HARDING
		(running alongside
		McMurphy)
	Pass the ball!
		(no response)
	Pass it!
		(no response)
	Pass it! Pass it! I'm open,
	McMurphy, pass the ball!

McMurphy stops dead in his tracks and flings the ball at
Harding. The ball bounces off Harding's head and goes out of
bounds. The WHISTLE BLOWS. Harding spins a few times.

			MCMURPHY (O.S.)
	Harding, get back here!

Harding turns to see the other team go by. They score another
basket. Score: AIDES 8 PATIENTS 0.

Billy takes the ball and passes into McMurphy, who turns to
see CANDY enter the gym, with her friend, ROSE.

			MCMURPHY
		(calling out)
	Candy. Candy, over here.
		(to Doctor Spivey)
	Hey, Doc, time out.

			SPIVEY
		(blowing his whistle)
	Time out!

McMurphy tosses the ball to Spivey, then crosses the court to
Candy and Rose, who have had a couple of drinks on the way
down.

			CANDY
	Mack, you sonofabitch, you ol'
	fucker, how've you been?

			MCMURPHY
		(swinging her around in
		his arms)
	Terrific, baby, terrific!
		(to Rose)
	Hi ya doin', Rose?

			ROSE
	Okay, Mack!
		(looking around)
	Whoowe, Candy girl, are we in an
	insane asylum or ain't we?

			MCMURPHY
		(to Candy)
	How's your ass been holdin' up,
	honey?

Candy pokes her ass at McMurphy. He gives it a squeeze. O.S.
a WHISTLE BLOWS.

			MCMURPHY
	Come on, girls, we're holding up
	the game!

McMurphy leads the two ladies across the court.

The entire gymnasium is riveted on the three of them. As they
reach Big Nurse:

			MCMURPHY
	Miss Ratched, this is my Aunt Candy
	and her friend Rose...

Greetings are exchanged.

			MCMURPHY
	Miss Ratched was kind enough to
	save you ladies a seat...

The two ladies wedge themselves in next to Big Nurse. O.S.
the WHISTLE BLOWS.

			MCMURPHY
	Talk to ya at half time!

McMurphy turns and crosses onto the court.

			CANDY
		(calling after him)
	Sock it to 'em, kid!

			ROSE
		(taking in the players)
	Are they all crazies?

			BIG NURSE
	No.

			ROSE
	Oh, just those guys dressed in
	white?

			BIG NURSE
	No, miss, it's the other way
	around.

			ROSE
	Well, you could've fooled me.

On the court, McMurphy throws the ball to Martini.

Martini throws the ball to McMurphy.

McMurphy throws the ball back to Martini.

Martini throws the ball into the stands.

The WHISTLE BLOWS O.S.

			MCMURPHY
	Whadaya doin', there's no one
	there!

			MARTINI
	I saw 'em! I saw 'em.

			HARDING (O.S.)
		(shouting)
	Mack, get back here!

McMurphy turns to see the other team go by and score a
basket.

Billy passes the ball into MeMurphy.

			MARTINI
	Gimme the ball!

			MCMURPHY
		(holding the ball)
	Okay, Martini. That's okay. Now you
	watch me.

McMurphy dribbles the ball down the sideline. Stops.

Goes into his routine of ball tricks: faking one way, then
the other, over his head, under his legs, finally ending on a
pass behind his back which goes straight into Washington's
hands. Washington dribbles down court for an easy layup.

Score: AIDES 10 PATIENTS 0

			MCMURPHY
		(to Spivey)
	Time out!

			SPIVEY
		(blowing his whistle)
	Time out!

			MCMURPHY
		(shouting to Timer)
	Replacement coming in! Harding out!

McMurphy crosses to Bromden, takes his hand, and leads him
onto the court and under the Acutes' basket, where he
maneuvers him into the proper position. Then McMurphy raises
his hands above his head and Bromden follows suit.

			MCMURPHY
		(starting back up court)
	Time in!
		(sees Harding still on
		court)
	Hold it! Time out!
		(to Harding)
	I said Harding out!

			HARDING
	I refuse!

			MCMURPHY
	I said out!

			HARDING
		(casting a quick look at
		his wife)
	No!

			MCMURPHY
	I'm the coach!

			HARDING
	I just started!

			MCMURPHY
	You can come back later!

			HARDING
	I don't trust you!

			MCMURPHY
	(looking for another victim)
	Scanlon out!

			SCANLON
	No!

			MCMURPHY
	Martini out!

			MARTINI
	No!

McMurphy looks at Billy.

			BILLY
	I-I-I-I-I'll g-g-g-go, M-M-Mack...

			MCMURPHY
	Good boy, thank you, Billy.

Billy goes off and sits by Big Nurse. Now, the lineup on the
bench is Billy, Big Nurse, Candy and Rose.

Spivey blows the whistle.

Under the Aides' basket, Harding passes the ball into
McMurphy, who dribbles to half court, takes his mark, and
lobs the ball over the outstretched arms of the Aides right
into Bromden's waiting hands. Bromden turns and slams the
ball into the basket.

The crowd goes bananas. Score: AIDES 10 PATIENTS 2

Bromden walks in majestic dignity the full length of the
court and takes up his position under the Aides' basket,
while McMurphy and his teammates have been putting tremendous
pressure on the Aides, not allowing them to pass the ball in.

As soon as McMurphy sees that Bromden is firmly set, hands
held up, under the Aides' basket, McMurphy turns and runs
down court, followed by the other Acutes, where they take up
their defensive position.

Washington and the Aides easily bring the ball down court,
work themselves into position, and take a shot at the basket,
which Bromden swats aside.

Each Aide gets a shot at the basket, and each time Bromden
swats it aside; sending the last swat into McMurphy's waiting
hands.

McMurphy dribbles the ball up court, where he runs into heavy
pressure from Washington.

			HARDING
		(off to the side of
		McMurphy)
	McMurphy, pass the ball!

McMurphy passes the ball to Harding and cuts toward the
basket.

			MCMURPHY
		(as he cuts past Harding)
	Harding, pass the ball!

Harding ignores McMurphy, as he runs by, and throws the ball
to Bromden, who turns and slams the ball into the basket.

The crowd goes bananas.

Score: AIDES 10 PATIENTS 4

			CANDY
		(at the top of her lungs)
	Atta boy, Mack!
		(to Big Nurse)
	What's he in for?

			BIG NURSE
	Who?

			CANDY
	Mack!

			BIG NURSE
	Miss, it's a complicated case. It
	would take too long to explain.

			CANDY
	Yeah, well, he looks like hell!

CHEERS are HEARD O.S. Candy turns back to the game.

CAMERA HOLDS on Candy, Big Nurse and Billy, who is staring at
Candy.

			BIG NURSE
		(to Billy)
	Billy, it's not polite to stare!

Billy sinks back, thinks it over, then presses forward.

			BILLY
		(to Candy)
	Miss!

Candy looks at Billy.

			BILLY (CONT'D)
	Hi!

			CANDY
		(giving him a big smile)
	Hi...

Billy sinks back in his seat.

On the court, McMurphy dribbles down to half court where he
is stopped by Washington and Warren, who put the squeeze on
him. McMurphy turns and gives them his ass to contend with,
then manages to throw the ball under his legs and
Washington's legs. The ball rolls to Martini, who scoops it
up and throwing it wildly away, the ball ricochets off the
backboard and goes in for two points.

The crowd goes bananas. Score: AIDES 10 PATIENTS 6

Bromden starts striding down court when the Aides make a fast
break past him, but miss their shot.

McMurphy retrieves the ball as Bromden, not more than several
feet from his own basket, does an about-face and returns to
his basket where he turns to see McMurphy lob the ball full
court to Bromden, who catches the ball on one bounce, turns
and slams the ball in for another basket.

Score: AIDES 10 PATIENTS 8

The crowd goes bananas and Bromden turns and starts striding
down the court when he sees McMurphy at the far end of the
court yelling at him.

			MCMURPHY
		(yelling and gesturing)
	Run, Chief, run!

Bromden gets the idea and starts loping down court abreast of
Washington, who is making another fast break towards his own
basket.

Washington and Bromden go up together and Bromden swats the
ball to Scanlon.

			MCMURPHY
		(yelling and gesturing)
	Run, Chief, run!

Bromden starts running towards his own basket, Washington hot
on his heels, when the ball is passed to him and he goes up,
makes the point, but takes a bad spill, crashing head over
heels to the floor.

The crowd gasps. The WHISTLE BLOWS.

			SPIVEY
		(shouting)
	Foul!

As McMurphy charges across court and grabs Washington by his
shirt...

			MCMURPHY
		(breathing in Washington's
		face)
	Ya fuckin' coon, you're not on the
	ward now!

			WASHINGTON
		(cool as a cucumber)
	Take you han's offa me!

Spivey comes running, blowing his whistle.

			SPIVEY
	Break it up, boys!
		(to Timer)
	Point counts. One free throw!

McMurphy pushes Washington away and turns to Bromden, who is
being helped off the floor by Harding, as...

			MARTINI AND SCANLON
	Great shot, Chief! Ya okay? You're
	doin' great!

They lead Bromden to the foul line.

			MCMURPHY
		(to Washington as they
		line up at the foul line)
	We got your black ass now,
	Washington, wanna bet another
	twenty?

			WASHINGTON
	No way...

Bromden takes the ball at the foul line. Sets himself up and
lobs the ball underhand. It goes in.

The crowd goes wild.

INT. MEN'S DORM - NIGHT

The patients are asleep except for Bromden who sits on the
edge of his bed watching McMurphy, his face pressed against
the window, looking out.

			TURKLE
		(approaching)
	What you boys doin' up at this
	ungodly time o' the night?

			MCMURPHY
	Prayin', brother. Prayin'.

			TURKLE 
	Well, you boys finish it up an'
	climb back into your beds. 'Kay?

			MCMURPHY
	'Kay...

The men slide into their beds and Turkle goes off, clucking
to himself.

A beat, then McMurphy rushes back to the window and looks
out.

McMURPHY'S POV

Outside, in the dark, Candy and Rose are seen wandering
around.

REVERSE ANGLE - BROMDEN AND McMURPHY

			MCMURPHY
	There they are, Chief!

McMurphy tries to get the girl's attention and fails.

			MCMURPHY
	Where are they goin'?

McMurphy takes off, towards the day room, followed by
Bromden.

INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT

As the two of them cross into the day room heading for the
window, Turkle sticks his head out of the nurses' station.

			TURKLE
	I thought I told you boys to go to
	bed!

			MCMURPHY
		(flagging the girls)
	Our prayers have been answered,
	Turkle! Our prayers have been
	answered!

McMURPHY'S POV

as we SEE the girls coming.

REVERSE ANGLE

			TURKLE
	Oh yeah...

			MCMURPHY
	I tell ya, there's an angel of
	mercy standing out there, Turkle.

			TURKLE
	Hallelujah, brother, now get back
	in bed!

			MCMURPHY
	Come an' see.

Turkle comes out of the nurses' station, leaving the side
window open.

			TURKLE
		(crossing to McMurphy)
	That angel of mercy, he ain't a
	she, is he?

			MCMURPHY
	You's better believe it, brother!

Turkle reaches the window and sees the girls outside.

CANDY and ROSE'S POV - THE MEN looking out.

BACK TO SCENE

as Turkle turns to McMurphy.

			TURKLE 
	Ah believe ya, brother. Ah believe
	ya!

			MCMURPHY
		(taking Turkle aside;
		holds up $20 bill)
	Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty
	bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece
	of that angel cake?

			TURKLE
		(taking the $20 and
		reaching for his keys)
	Ah'm on my knees, brother, ah'm on
	my knees.

Turkle unlocks the security screen and raises the window.

McMurphy sticks his head out the window.

			CANDY AND ROSE
		(both slightly tipsy)
	Hiya, Mack.

			MCMURPHY
	Hiya, girls...

			TURKLE
	Shhh...

Candy passes a heavy bag of bottles in. Then McMurphy and
Turkle help her in. Her dress is above her thighs, her ass
visible as she swings over the windowsill and into McMurphy's
arms.

			CANDY
	Whew! Made it!

			MCMURPHY
		(embracing Candy)
	Man, you look good 'nough to eat!

			CANDY
	Yeah, well you look like hell
	warmed over...

			ROSE (O.S.)
	Hey, pssst! Whadda 'bout me?

Turkle turns to help Rose in, but she's not as easy to
handle, being a good deal heavier and twice as plastered as
Candy.

			TURKLE
	Hey, Mac! Gimme a hand, will ya!

McMurphy disengages himself from Candy and lends Turkle a
hand. Rose is finally hauled into the room.

			ROSE
		(giggling; loud)
	Whew! Hiya, boys!

			TURKLE
	Shhh... let's move it away from the
	window...

The group shifts a few feet as Turkle closes the window and
locks the screen. McMurphy turns back to Candy.

			MCMURPHY
		(arms open)
	Come here, sugar...

Candy moves into McMurphy's arms as Rose, straightening her
dress, turns to see Bromden looming. Rose SCREAMS.

			TURKLE
	What happened?

			ROSE
		(backing into Turkle)
	What's that?

			TURKLE
		(mystified)
	What?

			ROSE
		(pointing at Bromden)
	That!

			TURKLE
	Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be
	afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief
	Bromden. That's all...

			ROSE
	Is he one of the loonies?

			MCMURPHY
	He's a patient, Rose...

			ROSE 
	Oh, yeah...

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah...

			ROSE 
		(approaching Bromden
		tentatively)
	Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'?
	Like it in here?

			MCMURPHY
	He can't hear you, Rose. He's just
	a big deaf an' dumb indian...

			CANDY
	Pssst! Hey Rose! There they are!

			ROSE
		(looking around)
	What? Where?

CANDY points to the patients sleeping in the men's dorm.

			CANDY
	In there.

			ROSE
	Wow! They're so quiet.

			TURKLE
	They're sleeping, Miss. They're
	sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down
	so we don't disturb their sleep.

			ROSE
	Are they dangerous when they're
	awake?

			TURKLE
	Oh, no, Miss. Not these loonies.
	These are nice guys. Nice guys.

			CANDY
	What's that smell?

			TURKLE
	What smell?

			CANDY
	Smells weird. Smells like
	pneumonia.

			TURKLE
	Ammonia, Miss...

			ROSE
	Smells like piss. Is this real,
	Candy? Is this really real? I mean
	we are in an insane asylum, an' I
	wanna know how we got ourselves
	into this scene.

			TURKLE
	Shhh, please, Miss. Keep it down...

Rose turns to McMurphy who has opened a bottle of booze and
is taking a long pull.

			ROSE
		(to McMurphy)
	Who is he?

			MCMURPHY
		(passing the bottle to
		Turkle)
	He's in charge.

			ROSE 
	Are you a doctor?

			TURKLE
		(passing the bottle to
		Rose)
	Not exactly, Miss. Not exactly.

			ROSE
		(drinking and passing the
		bottle to Candy)
	Yeah, well, I'll tell ya somethin'.
	I'll tell ya somethin'. I had this
	boyfriend, Chuck.
		(to McMurphy)
	Ya know him, Mac. Ya remember,
	Chuck.

			MCMURPHY
	Sure, I know Chuck. I know him.

			ROSE
	Well, listen to this. He got mad at
	me one day. Boy, did he get mad at
	me. He took the light bulb, ya
	know. I thought he was going to
	cram it right up me, ya know. But
	he ate it. He ate the whole fucking
	light bulb.
		(to Turkle)
	Now, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me!
	Is he crazy?

			TURKLE
	Well, Miss... I would say... I
	would say, yes. Yes, he's crazy.

			ROSE
	I thought so.

			TURKLE
	Is he in an asylum?

			ROSE
	He's dead.

			TURKLE
	Oh, I see. He was a very sick man.
	Very sick.

			ROSE
	That's what I told his mother. And
	she said I was crazy. Her son ate
	the whole fucking light bulb and
	she said I was crazy.

			TURKLE
	I don't know anything about that,
	Miss. I would have to examine you
	first...

			ROSE
	You ol' fucker!

			TURKLE
	Well, I'm running a risk by letting
	you in, Miss. You know I'm runnin'
	a risk of gettin' my black ass
	fired. If you understand what I
	mean...

			MCMURPHY
	Sure, she understands what you
	mean. She's not dumb. Why do you
	think Rose came to visit us? Rose
	is very interested in hospitals and
	hospital facilities. Aren't you,
	Rose?

			ROSE
	What?

			TURKLE
	I'll be very glad to show you
	around, Miss...

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah, that's a good idea, Turkle.
	Why don't ya take Rose on a little
	tour of our facilities...

			ROSE
	Wait a minute...

			CANDY
	It's okay, Rose. You can go with
	him.

			ROSE
	Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind,
	I'll decide on my own date!

			CANDY
	Shit, Rose! What's there to decide?
	There's only four of us.

			ROSE
	Whaddaya talkin' about? There's at
	least twenty guys in there. Let's
	wake 'em up and get this party on
	the road.

			TURKLE
	Now, Miss. What do you want with
	twenty zombies when you got a
	twenty gun salute looking you right
	in the face.

			ROSE
	Oh, yeah...

			TURKLE
	You better believe it, you sweet
	little thing. You better believe
	it...

			ROSE
	Don't you sweet talk me you ol'
	spook, you!

			TURKLE
	Oh, I'm all through talkin'. Now,
	let's just you an' me trip on down
	that hall.

			CANDY
	Go with him, Rose. Go with him.

			ROSE
	Well, okay, but I just want to look
	at the facilities. That's all.

			TURKLE
	That's all I'm going to show you.

McMURPHY'S POV - TURKLE AND ROSE

as the two of them cross out of the day room toward the
hallway, Turkle suddenly turns and hurries back to McMurphy,
takes the bottle of booze and hurries off clucking to
himself.

BACK TO McMURPHY and CANDY.

			MCMURPHY
	'Kay, lets get under way.

McMurphy crosses to package of booze, selects another bottle,
unscrews the top and takes a long pull, then hands the bottle
to Bromden.

			MCMURPHY
	Down the ol' hatch, Chief.

Bromden takes a long pull on the bottle, gags and passes the
bottle to McMurphy who crosses to the nurses' station and
peeks around the corner.

McMURPHY

as he peeks around the corner.

McMURPHY'S POV - TURKLE AND ROSE

far down the hallway, as Turkle shows Rose one room, then
another, and then the seclusion room, into which Turkle
playfully lures Rose, who playfully resists, but finally
enters. A beat passes and they don't come out.

BACK TO McMURPHY

Satisfied, he crosses to the nurses' station, reaches in the
open side-door window, opens the door and enters.

INT. NURSES' STATION - NIGHT

as McMurphy enters the nurses' station and looks around.

INT. MEN'S DORM - NIGHT

The patients are all asleep. A very long beat, then --

			MCMURPHY (V.O.)
		(through loudspeaker; very
		low, ominous, drawn out)
	Who knows what evil lurks in the
	hearts of men...

Ominous LAUGHTER, then the lights go flashing on and off.

			MCMURPHY (V.O)
		(through loudspeaker)
	Medication time! Medication time!
	Rise and shine! Rise and shine!
	Time to say goodbye... Everybody
	up, up, up!

Some of the patients immediately pop awake as Candy comes in
and starts hustling the patients out of bed.

			CANDY
	Up and at 'em, boys.

			BILLY
		(waking up)
	H-H-Hi, Candy...

			CANDY
	Hi, Billy.

INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT

MUSIC OVER as the patients are queued up at the nurses'
station where Candy is handing out cups full of whiskey,
McMurphy backing her up, pouring the booze into the cups.
Harding takes his cup and moves back into the day room as
Ellis automatically downs the booze, gags and goes spinning
off across the hallway and is nailed to the wall.

					QUICK CUT TO:

DOWN THE HALL - TURKLE

sticks his head out the door to check the scene out. Sees
what's happening and comes rushing down the hallway, without
his shirt, and zipping up his pants.

INT. NURSES' STATION - NIGHT

as Turkle shoves his way to the intercom system and switches
off the lights and music.

			TURKLE
		(furiously pushing them
		out)
	You crazy goons... shut up an' get
	outta here... Out! Out! Out!

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Silence as the last man is driven out of the nurses' station.

Down the hallway, a light goes on in the visitors' room.

			TURKLE
	Shit, it's the soo-per-visor come
	to fire my black ass.

A KEY is HEARD hitting the lock at the end of the hallway.
Without losing a beat, Turkle reverses his movement and
starts pushing everybody back into the nurses' station.

			TURKLE (CONT'D)
		(pushing)
	Get back in there! In! In! In!

As Turkle pushes the last man into the nurses' station, he
sees Rose stick her head out of the seclusion room.

			TURKLE (CONT'D)
		(motioning and shouting)
	Stay in there! Stay in there!

Rose ducks back into the seclusion room as, simultaneously,
Turkle closes the door behind him to the nurses' station as
the door to the ward opens and the NIGHT SUPERVISOR, a middle
aged woman, enters the ward.

INT. NURSES' STATION - NIGHT

as Turkle, shushing the crowd, makes his way to the nurses'
lounge and opens the door.

			TURKLE
		(harsh whisper)
	Alla ya goons, get in here!

The patients pile into the nurses' lounge, Turkle cramming
the last one through the door and closing it. He turns and
crosses to the side door and steps out.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

as Turkle steps out of the nurses' station, closing the door
behind him.

			NIGHT SUPERVISOR
	Oh, there you are, Mister Turkle.

			TURKLE
	Evenin', ma'am.

			NIGHT SUPERVISOR
	Is everything all right?

			TURKLE
		(blocking her way to the
		day room)
	Why, sure, ma'am...

			NIGHT SUPERVISOR
	The lights were flashing on and
	off, Mister Turkle.

			TURKLE
	Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.

			NIGHT SUPERVISOR
	At this hour?

			TURKLE
	Cleanliness is a twenty-four-hour
	job, ma'am...

Harding passes by and enters the latrine.

			NIGHT SUPERVISOR
	What are these men doing up
	wandering around?

			TURKLE
		(leaning in)
	Ah guess the natives are restless,
	ma'am...

			NIGHT SUPERVISOR
		(getting a whiff of his
		breath)
	You've been drinking on the job
	again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!

			TURKLE
	Ah, no, ma'am... well, yes,
	ma'am...
		(leaning in close)
	A man get awful lonely at night, if
	ya know what Ah mean, ma'am...

Down the hall, Rose sticks her head out the door, sees what's
happening, and ducks back in as the Night Supervisor turns on
her heel and starts back down the hallway, Turkle at her
heels.

			NIGHT SUPERVISOR
	I want those men put back to bed,
	Mister Turkle!

			TURKLE
	Yes, ma'am...

			NIGHT SUPERVISOR
	And you haven't heard the last of
	this!

			TURKLE
	Yes, ma'am...

She opens the gate, slams it behind her, crosses to the main
door, opers it and exits to:

			TURKLE (CONT'D)
		(calling after her)
	Night, night.

Turkle turns and the smile leaves his face as he hurries down
the hallway.

O.S. the TOILET FLUSHES as Turkle stops at the seclusion room
and sticks his head in.

			TURKLE (CONT'D)
	Be right back, honey...

Turkle closes the door, crosses down to the nurses' station,
and enters as Harding comes out of the latrine.

INT. NURSES' STATION - NIGHT

as Turkle enters, crosses to the nurses' lounge and opens the
door to see the patients, silhouetted against the open
refrigerator light, moving around, pulling the room apart. It
smacks of Dante's Inferno as Turkle snaps on the light and
steps into the room.

INT. NURSES' LOUNGE - NIGHT

as Turkle steps into the room and sees the extent of the
plundering. The filing cabinet is open. So is the medicine
cabinet. Rolls of medical gauze are strewn around, cough
syrup and orange juice are flowing.

The patients start piling out of the room, carrying their
plunder.

Fredrickson and Sefelt are SEEN sitting on the floor, in
front of the open refrigerator, looking through their
dossiers.

			FREDRICKSON
	Christ, they even got my first
	grade report card here...

			SEFELT
	Lemme see...

Sefelt leans in, unintentionally tipping a bottle of cough
syrup in his hand which goes "glug, glug, glug..." all over
the papers.

			SEFELT (CONT'D)
	Jesus, they're terrible grades,
	Fred...

Turkle stoically takes in the shattered remains of his job,
unscrews the top to his bottle of whiskey, and takes the
biggest swig of his life as, O.S., Rose is HEARD SCREAMING.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

as Rose, naked as the day she was born, runs screaming down
the hall, Ellis loping after her, reaching out his hand.

INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT

as the others, who are laying out food, drinking booze and
stringing up hospital gauze, turn to see Rose enter the room.
She runs behind McMurphy, pressing her body to his, as he
gently takes hold of Ellis' outstretched hands.

			MCMURPHY
		(to Rose)
	Don't scream, honey...

He gently guides Ellis to the wall, with Rose still clinging
to his back.

			MCMURPHY
	Ellis ain't gonna hurt you... Ellis
	is nice... Nice Ellis... see the
	nice lady...

He pins Ellis to the wall.

			MCMURPHY
	There, see, nice lady touch
	Ellis...

Rose reaches out and touches Ellis.

The others stand agog, looking at this Holy Trinity.

					DISSOLVE TO:

INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT

A SOFT NOSTALGIC NUMBER is HEARD OVER LOUDSPEAKER as Harding,
Billy and Cheswick watch McMurphy dance with Candy,
Fredrickson with Sefelt and Rose, who is dressed, dance with
Taber.

Martini and Scanlon are busy draping hospital gauze around
the room.

Bromden sits by the window -- waiting.

					DISSOLVE TO:

INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT

Another SOFT NOSTALGIC NUMBER is HEARD OVER LOUDSPEAKER as
McMurphy, Candy, Harding, Cheswick, Taber, Sefelt and
Fredrickson watch Rose, on a table, doing a solo bump-and
grind dance, while Martini and Scanlon race around the room
in wheelchairs.

Billy sits, watching Candy and McMurphy, who sit across the
room.

Candy is tired and bored.

McMurphy is drunk and starting to fade.

			CANDY
	It's time to hit the road, Mack...

			MCMURPHY
		(snapping at her)
	Don't worry 'bout the road! We'll
	hit the road! It'll be there when
	we're ready!
		(to the room)
	Ain't that right, fellas?

He gets up and crosses to his friends.

			MCMURPHY
	I jus' want you guys to have a good
	time... Are ya havin' a good time?
	You... you... good... good... Lez
	have some fun...

He turns to see Billy, who isn't having fun.

			MCMURPHY
	Whatsa matter with ya...

Billy turns away and McMurphy crosses to him.

			MCMURPHY
	Ain'tcha havin' a good time...
		(no response)
	Whadaya want? Ya wanna drink? A
	cigarette...

Billy looks up at McMurphy, his eyes are flooded with tears.

			MCMURPHY
	Whatsamatter, kid, what's botherin'
	you...?

			BILLY
	Ah-ah-ah-are y-y-y-you g-g-g-going
	t-t-t-to muh-muh-muh-marry her?

			MCMURPHY
	Marry who?

			BILLY 
	C-C-C-C-Candy!

			MCMURPHY
	Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a
	good friend, that's all...

			BILLY
	Wu-wu-wu I-I-I-I th-th-think sh-sh
	sh-she's th-th-th-the ma-ma-ma-most
	bu-bu-bu-beautiful wu-wu-wu-woman
	in th-th-the whole world!

A long beat as McMurphy looks at Billy, then Candy, then
Billy.

			MCMURPHY
		(softly)
	Why don't ya go tell 'er...

Billy doesn't move.

			MCMURPHY
	Go on, son, now's your chance...

Billy slowly crosses toward Candy, stopping halfway to look
back at McMurphy, who gives him an affirmative gesture. He
crosses to Candy, who just looks at him.

			BILLY
	C-C-Candy, wu-wu-will y-y-you mu-mu
	marry me!

			CANDY
	Ah, Billy...

Candy rises, kisses Billy on the cheek, and dances with him.

McMurphy beams on the twosome, unscrews his whiskey bottle,
takes a long pull on the juice, and looks at Bromden.

Bromden sits by the window waiting.

					DISSOLVE TO:

INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT

as the MUSIC ENDS. A long silence, then another NUMBER begins
as McMurphy, who has nodded off, starts awake and looks
around.

McMURPHY'S POV

Bromden sits by the window waiting.

Cheswick is asleep on the table.

Martini and Scanlon are sitting in their wheelchairs filling
their cups from through the enema tube.

Harding sits, maintaining his aloofness, smoking a cigarette.

Sefelt is sitting on the floor, in a drunken stupor, while
Fredrickson dances around him.

Candy and Billy stand, locked in each other's arms, swaying
to the MUSIC.

McMURPHY

struggles to his feet, steadies himself, crosses to the
nurses' station.

INT. NURSES' LOUNGE - NIGHT

as McMurphy enters and goes to Turkle, who is dead asleep.
McMurphy lifts Turkle's keys and leaves.

INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT

as McMurphy crosses to Billy and Candy, and gently parting
them, he puts his arms around them -- as much for support as
affection.

			MCMURPHY
	Come on, you lovers, it's gettin'
	late...

They move toward the hallway.

Bromden and Harding are the only two who watch them go.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

as McMurphy passes several doors, reaches the door of his
choice, fumbles with the keys, finds the right one, and opens
the door to the seclusion room.

			MCMURPHY
		(standing aside)
	In ya go...

			BILLY
		(holding back)
	M-M-M-Mack?

			MCMURPHY
	It's okay, kid. Everything it going
	to be okay... I'll come back an'
	getcha in a while... 'Kay...

Candy and Billy, hand in hand, enter the small room, which
has a bed in it.

McMurphy closes the door, looks at the keys, and pockets
them. CAMERA TRACKS with McMurphy, who is a very weary man,
back into the day room.

INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT

MUSIC OVER LOUDSPEAKER as McMurphy crashes heavily into his
chair. He can hardly keep his eyes open as he looks around.

Harding sits nearby.

Taber is lying on a couch, his head in Rose's lap.

Cheswick is asleep on the table.

Ellis stands nailed to the wall.

Bromden sits by the window -- waiting. CAMERA HOLDS on
Bromden.

			MCMURPHY (V.O.)
	Hey, Harding, wake me in an hour.

			HARDING (V.O.)
	Sure, Mack...

CAMERA PUSHES INTO WINDOW. TIME LAPSE SHOT of the DAWN and
SUN RISING.

			WASHINGTON (V.O.)
		(very far away; getting
		closer)
	Bibbit? Where's Bill Bibbit, ya
	damn goons?

INT. DAY ROOM - EARLY MORNING

as Washington jostles McMurphy awake.

			WASHINGTON
	Come on, get over there!

McMurphy allows himself to be led to the heavy security
partition, by the men's dorm, where all the patients are
lined up.

It is morning and the day room is a mess:

A few chairs turned over. Paper cups and empty bottles.
Puddles of cough syrup, orange juice and apple juice worked
into sticky masses.

Rose sits by herself on the couch.

Bromden is the last one led to the lineup, where Big Nurse
waits.

			BIG NURSE
	Thank you, Mister Washington!
	Mister McMurphy, do you know where
	Billy is?

McMurphy shrugs "no."

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Mister Harding, have you seen
	Billy?

Harding shrugs "no."

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Mister Sefelt...

Big Nurse's question is cut off as all the patients and
attendants turn their heads toward the hallway and start
laughing. Big Nurse turns to see Turkle, without his shirt
on, walk into the seclusion room and close the door behind
him.

Big Nurse turns and starts down the hallway, the laughter
trailing after her when, suddenly, the laughter breaks off as
Big Nurse stops and in the silence, she opens the door.

INT. SECLUSION ROOM - EARLY MORNING

as Big Nurse opens the door to see Candy snuggled up to
Billy, who lies there, eyes closed, a smile on his face.

			TURKLE
		(buttoning up his shirt)
	Morning, Miss Ratched...

He slides out of the room as Billy opens his eyes. A long
beat as they look at each other.

			BILLY
	M-M-M-M-M-M-

Big Nurse shakes her head and exits, closing the door behind
her.

INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

as Big Nurse heads for the day room, walking straight for
McMurphy when:

			BILLY (O.S.)
		(shouting)
	M-M-M-Miss Ratched!

Big Nurse stops and turns to see Billy, half naked, pulling
his pajama pants up as he runs, stumbling toward Big Nurse.

			BILLY (CONT'D)
		(crying out as he runs)
	P-p-p-please du-du-don't t-t-t-tell
	m-m-my muh-muh-muh-mummy!

He trips on his pajamas and falls sprawling at Big Nurse's
feet, his bare ass exposed to all.

			BILLY (CONT'D)
		(blubbering as he rises)
	P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t
	tell her, p-p-please...

			BIG NURSE
	You should have thought about that
	before you brought that woman in
	here!

			BILLY
	N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't,
	I didn't!

			BIG NURSE
	I don't want your mother to believe
	something like this but what am I
	to think?

			BILLY
	Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!

			BIG NURSE
	Billy, that girl couldn't have
	pulled you in there forcibly...

			BILLY
	Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!

			BIG NURSE
	Who? Tell me!

			BILLY
	M-M-Muh-Muh-McMurphy!

			MCMURPHY
	Ahhh, Billy...

			BILLY 
		(caught in his own
		anxiety)
	P-p-p-please duh-duh-duh-duh t-t
	tell, M-M-M-Miss R-R-Ratched, y-y
	you don't need to!

			BIG NURSE
	Get up, Billy.

			BILLY
		(screaming)
	No! No! No!

Billy pitches forward and collapses on the floor, screaming,
pounding his fists and feet against the floor.

			BILLY (CONT'D)
	N-n-n-n-duh-duh-duh-pl-pl-pl-pl-muh
	muh-muh...

			BIG NURSE
		(ignoring McMurphy)
	Mister Washington.

			MCMURPHY
		(helplessly to Billy)
	Hey, Billy, stop cryin'. You don't
	have to cry... You ain't got
	nothin' to be ashamed of. She ain't
	gonna tell you mother... stop
	crying...

			WASHINGTON
	Yes, Miss Ratched!

			BIG NURSE
		(to Washington)
	Put him in Doctor Spivey's office!

			WASHINGTON
	Yes, Miss Ratched...

Washington nods to Warren and the two of them scoop Billy off
the floor and carry him screaming to Doctor Spivey's office
as Big Nurse crosses into the nurses' station and picks up
the phone as Candy eases her way into the day room and joins
McMurphy.

A beat, then Miller starts herding the patients toward the
washroom, staying clear of McMurphy and Bromden, who don't
move.

McMurphy pulls the keys out of his pocket.

			MCMURPHY
		(to Candy)
	Let's go!

McMurphy checks the nurses' station, sees Big Nurse is busy
on the telephone.

			MCMURPHY
		(to Bromden)
	Let's go, Chief...

McMurphy crosses to the window, followed by Bromden, Candy
and Rose, where he begins fumbling with the lock.

MILLER

as he herds the patients out of the day room. He turns to see
McMurphy trying to open the screen. Miller crosses to
McMurphy.

			MILLER
	Hey, what's gone here?

McMurphy turns around and punches Miller.

INT. NURSES' STATION - MORNING

as Big Nurse, still on the phone, sees Miller go sprawling
across the floor. She grabs the intercom.

			BIG NURSE (V.O.)
		(through loudspeaker)
	Washington! Warren! To the day
	room, immediately!

INT. DAY ROOM - MORNING

McMurphy opens the screen, raises the window, and helps Candy
and Rose out as Washington and Warren converge on them.
McMurphy and Bromden wheel around.

Washington, Warren and Miller appear around the corner, take
one look, and head straight for McMurphy.

			WASHINGTON
		(stopping just short)
	'Kay, let's have the keys an'
	nobody get hurt!

Washington's words are cut off as, O.S., Nurse Pilbow
SCREAMS... a bloodcurdling scream. They turn to see Nurse
Pilbow enter the nurses' station, her uniform splattered with
blood, hysterically talking to Big Nurse (we can't hear her).

Big Nurse and Nurse Pilbow rush out of the nurses' station
and head down the hallway.

McMurphy is glued to the spot.

			CANDY
		(calling from outside)
	Come on, come on, let's go!

McMurphy hesitates, then moves across the day room toward the
hallway.

INT. DOCTOR SPIVEY'S OFFICE - MORNING

CAMERA SHOOTING TOWARD the door, crammed full of patients,
who stare at the scene with curious detached looks, as Big
Nurse and Nurse Pilbow force their way through the patients.
The crowd parts and Big Nurse stops in the doorway, horrified
at what she sees. CAMERA HOLDS on Big Nurse's reaction. A
beat, then McMurphy appears alongside Big Nurse and is
stricken by what he sees.

McMURPHY AND BIG NURSE'S POV - REVERSE SHOT - DOCTOR SPIVEY'S
OFFICE

The office is splattered with blood. Billy is lying face up,
hanging over Spivey's desk, dead. His throat and both wrists
are cut. A broken picture frame, containing a photograph of
Spivey's family, lies nearby.

			MCMURPHY
	Billy, oh, Billy boy...

McMurphy crosses into the room and kneels alongside Billy's
body. He gently lays his hand on Billy's face.

			BIG NURSE
	Get away from him! Don't you dare
	touch him!

McMurphy turns and leaps at Big Nurse, grabbing her throat;
he drives her into the Acutes and Nurse Pilbow.

INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

as McMurphy, Big Nurse, Nurse Pilbow and several Acutes go
down, arms and legs intertwined, kicking, trying to get away
as McMurphy strangles Big Nurse.

Nurse Pilbow screaming, as Washington, Warren, Miller rush
in, trying to break his hold on Big Nurse's throat, her face
turning blue. McMurphy's face, twisted by his passion, when
Washington lands a rabbit punch and MeMurphy's face relaxes
as he passes out.

					DISSOLVE TO:

INT. DAY ROOM - DAY

MUSIC OVER LOUDSPEAKER. The day room is as it was in the
beginning. Harding is dealing out a game of blackjack to
Martini,

Scanlon, Cheswick and Fredrickson.

Taber, pencil in band, sits pondering over a blank sheet of
paper.

Ruckly is turning a grimy photograph over in his hands.

Bancini sits wagging his head, mumbling over and over,
"Tired... awful tired..." Ellis stands against the wall, arms
outstretched.

			HARDING (V.O.)
		(over last scene, in
		McMurphy's style)
	Okay, suckers, place your bets...

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Bromden is mopping the floor near the security gate to the
visitors' room, when a key hits the lock. Bromden looks up
expectantly.

BROMDEN'S POV

as Sefelt and Miller enter the visitors' room, cross to the
security gate and pass into the hallway. Bromden goes back to
his mopping.

INT. DAY ROOM - DAY

as Sefelt jauntily enters the day room.

			BIG NURSE (V.O.)
		(through loudspeaker)
	Did everything go well, Mister
	Sefelt?

Sefelt turns to the nurses' station where, inside, Big Nurse
sits very erect, wearing a back brace that reaches up around
her neck. Sefelt shows his teeth and gums to Big Nurse.

			BIG NURSE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
		(through loudspeaker)
	That's very nice. Now, doesn't that
	make you feel better, Mister
	Sefelt?

			SEFELT
	Yes, ma'am...

			BIG NURSE
	Good...

She turns back to her work.

Sefelt crosses to the card game, where he sits and catches
Fredrickson's attention; showing him his teeth. Fredrickson
smiles at Sefelt and blows him a kiss.

			HARDING
		(who has been dealing)
	Big Ace... a lovely lady... another
	ace... an' a little trey, hey, hey,
	whadaya say... hit or sit?

			SCANLON
	Hit!

			SEFELT
		(to Fredrickson)
	Ya know what, Fred?

			FREDRICKSON
	What?

			HARDING
		(dealing a card to
		Scanlon)
	Big king, too bad...

			SEFELT
	Just wait till you hear...

			HARDING
	Hear what?

			SEFELT
	McMurphy killed two attendants and
	escaped...

			HARDING
	When?

			SEFELT

			SEFELT
	Gary Blinker...

			SCANLON
	Gary Blinker's fulla shit!

			MARTINI
	He's not!

			SCANLON
	He is!

Harding slams his card down on the table, rises and crosses
to the nurses' station where he taps on the side window.

Big Nurse gets up, crosses to the window and slides it open.

			BIG NURSE
	Yes, Mister Harding?

			HARDING
	Is it true McMurphy killed two
	attendants and escaped yesterday?

			BIG NURSE
	No. Mister Harding, that is not
	true.

					DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON

Bromden is squatting, leaning against the wall near the
security gate to the visitors' room, when a KEY HITS THE
LOCK. He looks up expectantly. This time it is McMurphy. Or
what was McMurphy, for his head is bandaged, and his tongue
hangs out of his mouth as he is led across the visitors' room
by an ATTENDANT.

McMurphy shows Bromden no sign of recognition, which Bromden
pays no attention to, thinking McMurphy is putting on the
same act he did when he came back from Electro-Shock Therapy.

Bromden joyously turns and runs down the hallway to the day
room.

INT. DAY ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

as Bromden crosses into the day room, gets a seat, and sits
facing the hallway, bursting with expectation.

A long beat, then the Attendant appears with McMurphy and
taps at the side door to the nurses' station.

The Acutes break off their card game and look at McMurphy;
their faces hang open at his appearance.

Big Nurse crosses to the side door, opens it, and steps out
into the day room. To the Attendant as she takes McMurphy by
the arm:

			BIG NURSE
	Thank you...

			ATTENDANT
	Yes, ma'am...

The Attendant exits.

			BIG NURSE
		(to McMurphy)
	Now, let's find you a place to sit,
	shall we, Mister McMurphy?

Big Nurse gently guides McMurphy to a seat on the Chronics'
side of the room.

Bromden can hardly contain himself as he waits for McMurphy
to go into his act.

The Acutes have already absorbed the reality of McMurphy's
condition as they exchange looks with each other.

			FREDRICKSON
		(whispering)
	Lobotomy...

			HARDING
	Yeah...

			SCANLON
	Yeah, that Gary Blinker is fulla
	shit...

The Acutes turn back to their card game as Harding shuffles
and deals the cards out.

Bromden keeps his eyes glued to Big Nurse and McMurphy.

			BIG NURSE
		(sitting McMurphy down)
	Here now, you sit here... That's
	it...

Big Nurse pats McMurphy's face and crosses back to the
nurses' station.

McMurphy just sits there, his head lolling to one side.

Bromden waits for McMurphy to go into his routine.

McMurphy just sits there.

Bromden snaps his fingers and slaps his thigh, then waits for
McMurphy to follow suit.

McMurphy just sits there slobbering.

Bromden slaps his thigh again.

No response from McMurphy.

The MUSIC PLAYS ON.

					DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MEN'S DORM - DAYBREAK

as Bromden stands by the window looking out. A long beat,
then he turns into the room and looks around.

BROMDEN'S POV

The patients are all asleep. The new night attendant is fast
asleep in the nurses' station.

Bromden quietly takes his pillow and goes to McMurphy's bed,
where he kneels and puts his head very close to McMurphy's. A
long beat as Bromden studies McMurphy's face.

			BROMDEN
		(whispering in McMurphy's
		ear)
	When I first came here I was so
	scared of being lost I had to
	holler so they could track me... I
	figured anything was better than
	being lost...

On the last word, Bromden places his pillow over McMurphy's
face and begins to suffocate him. McMurphy starts thrashing
and Bromden lies full length on McMurphy. A long beat, then
the thrashing ends. Bromden gets off McMurphy, replaces his
pillow, and crosses down the aisle toward the day room.

INT. DAY ROOM - DAYBREAK

The night attendant continues to sleep as Bromden passes the
nurses' station, heading for the tub room.

INT. TUB ROOM - DAWN

as Bromden crosses to the heavy machine which McMurphy had
once tried to lift, sizes it up, then bends over and takes
hold and heaves. The GRINDING WEIGHT is HEARD as Bromden
exerts all his strength, slowly lifts the machine off the
floor, balances it above his shoulders, then crosses out of
the tub room.

INT. DAY ROOM - DAWN

as Bromden comes around the corner and past the sleeping
night attendant in the nurses' station.

Bromden lines himself up with the window across the room,
then starts toward it, picking up speed as he goes. Then, at
the last moment, he stops and, with an enormous effort, he
hurls the machine through the security screen and the window.
A LOUD CRASH.

In the nurses' station, the night attendant starts awake and
looks around. Too late as Bromden vaults through the window.
CAMERA HOLDS on window as Bromden runs across the grounds and
disappears into the pine trees.

INT. DAY ROOM - DAWN

as the night attendant comes out of the nurses' station and
looks confusedly around. Then he spots the shattered window.

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - EXTREME LONG SHOT - SUNRISE

Rolling hills, forests and distant mountains, bathed in
sunlight, as Bromden runs across a far-off meadow.

CREDITS OVER.

			THE END
EXT. WORK FARM - NIGHTFALL

All we SEE is an ELEVATED SHOT of the distant mountains,
rolling landscape and McMURPHY -- one cheek laid-open and
crusted over with dried blood, his face and prison work
clothes caked with dried sweat and dust -- as he sits on the
very top of a water tower watching the last rays of sunlight.

A long moment passes before McMurphy's attention is drawn
elsewhere and he looks down.

REVERSE SHOT - McMURPHY'S POV

Far below, in the prison yard a MAN is SEEN hurrying acrcss
the yard where he joins a group of men composed of armed
prison guards, officials, and medics -- a stretcher, an
ambulance, a fire truck and safety nets spread out at the
base of the water tower. The man is seen talking to the
officials, then a bullhorn is handed to him and they all look
up at McMurphy.

McMURPHY

As he looks down at them, a searchlight is turned on him.

			MAN (V.O.)
		(through bullhorn)
	McMurphy! This is Doctor Shankle,
	from the infirmary. Can you hear
	me?

McMurphy doesn't respond.

			SHANKLE (V.O.)
		(through bullhorn)
	Can you hear me, McMurphy?

McMurphy doesn't respond. Another searchlight goes on as a
SECOND VOICE is PICKED UP on the BULLHORN.

			SECOND VOICE
		(through bullhorn)
	Why don't we blast 'im, for Christ
	sake, he ain't gonna come down...
	you...

The BULLHORN is TURNED OFF. A long moment passes as McMurphy
continues to squat on the tower and wait. He shivers against
the coming night when...

			SHANKLE (V.O.)
		(through bullhorn)
	McMurphy!
	I have the warden's promise. If you
	come down, nobody will hurt you!
	You'll be in my custody! I promise!

An imperceptible smile appears on McMurphy's face.

INT. MEN'S DORM - OREGON STATE HOSPITAL - DAWN

Strange HUMMING SOUNDS, CLANKING PIPES and HISSING RADIATORS
as we see beds, with patients lying asleep, line two walls.
The third wall is a heavy gauge steel grill, with a door that
opens on to the day room. The door is open. On the far side
of the day room, a long hallway with other doors opening into
rooms: the latrine, washroom, tub room, mess hall, seclusion
room, psychiatrist's office, visitors' room, etc.

Across the day room, a glass enclosed nurses' station where
TURKLE, a Negro night attendant, is seen preparing to go off
duty.

The CAMERA PANS the beds in the men's dorm. One man turns,
another twists, a third lies as if dead.

CAMERA PAN ENDS on BROMDEN, who lies still, eyes wide open,
very alert. He reaches down, plucks a stale piece of gum from
under the bed frame, puts it in his mouth and starts chewing.

A beat, then Bromden carefully undoes the leather strap which
binds him to the bed. He slips out of bed and quietly makes
his way down the aisle, paying no attention to the other
patients, some of who are beginning to stir awake.

Ahead, at the end of the hallway, the door opens and three
Negro day attendants, WASHINGTON, WARREN and MILLER, dressed
in white uniforms, enter and move down the hallway and
disappear into a side room.

Bromden continues his silent journey towards the day room as
Turkle emerges from the side door to the nurses' lounge, goes
up the hallway as MISS PILBOW, the day nurse, comes in,
passing Turkle on the way out. She crosses to the nurses'
station and enters as Bromden reaches the day room.

INT. DAY ROOM - DAY

as Bromden makes his way across the day room, past the
nurses' station, unnoticed by Miss Pilbow who is busy
preparing the day's medication.

Bromden is sliding along the hallway wall, when he is
suddenly cut off by a mop which THUDS against one side of his
neck. A second mop yokes him on the other side. Bromden
freezes. Terrified.

			MILLER
	Where you goin', Chief?

			WARREN
	You goin' t'see the Big White
	Fathuh?

			WASHINGTON
	He goin' t'see the Big White
	Muthuh...

They cackle, legs jiving, as the ammonia stings Bromden's
eyes and burns his nose. He tries to twist his head, but
Washington jams the mop harder. Bromden freezes, panic
spreading across his face.

			WASHINGTON (CONT'D)
	Haw, look at 'im, big 'nough to eat
	apples off my head an' he mine me
	like a baby...

A KEY is HEARD hitting the lock in the main door. Washington
very adroitly releases Bromden, hands him the mop, and turns,
along with Warren and Miller, to their duties, as BIG NURSE
enters the ward.

			THREE ATTENDANTS
		(simultaneously, as Big
		Nurse passes)
	Mornin', Miss Ratched...

			BIG NURSE
	Good morning, boys.

She sweeps by and disappears into the nurses' station. The
three attendants put their mops and rags aside and start
towards the men's dorm, leaving Bromden pressed against the
wall, mop in hand.

INT. NURSES' STATION

as Big Nurse enters to be greeted by Miss Pilbow, who wears
an enormous cross between her breasts.

			MISS PILBOW
	Good morning, Miss Ratched. It's a
	beautiful day, isn't it?

			BIG NURSE
	Mean old Monday, Miss Pilbow, mean
	old Monday...
		(she flips on the
		intercom)
	Good morning, boys. Rise and shine.
	Rise and shine.

INT. MEN'S DORM - DAY

as Washington, Warren and Miller roust the patients out of
bed.

			BIG NURSE (V.O.)
		(through loudspeaker)
	Time to get up! Come on now, it's a
	beautiful day! Let's not straggle!
	Everybody up, up, up!

The Chronics are physically helped out of bed as the Acutes,
who can handle themselves, cross out into the Day Room,
rubbing the sleep out of their eyes. Big Nurse steps out of
the Nurses' Station. Washington and Warren are hustling the
patients toward the washroom.

Miller stays behind, stripping Blastic's bed and rolling up
his mattress.

INT. DAY ROOM - DAY

as the Acutes straggle past Big Nurse.

			BIG NURSE
	Good morning, Mister Sefelt... Good
	morning, Mister Fredrickson. Good
	morning, Billy, I spoke to your
	mother last night and she sends her
	love... Good morning, Mister
	Harding... Good morning, Mister
	Cheswick. Mister Scanlon...

Bromden comes drifting by, going in the opposite direction.
Big Nurse takes his hand and reaches up and pats his face.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Oh, Mister Bromden...
		(calling out)
	Mister Washington!

Washington comes running.

			WASHINGTON
	Yes, Miss Ratched?

			BIG NURSE
	Mister Washington, why don't we get
	a good head start on the day by
	shaving Mister Bromden and see if
	we can't avoid a disturbance.

			WASHINGTON
		(taking Bromden by the
		hand)
	Yes, Miss Ratched...

INT. WASHROOM - DAY

The patients are busy washing and shaving.

Warren is assisting a vegetable wash himself as Washington
guides Bromden through a cage-like partition... where an
antique barber chair stands.

			WASHINGTON
		(calling as he goes)
	Warren!

He sits Bromden down and straps his bands and legs in, then
plugs the electric shaver in and turns it on and brings the
BUZZING instrument towards Bromden's face. Bromden turns
away.

			WASHINGTON (CONT'D)
		(shouting out)
	Get your black ass in here!

Warren props the vegetable up against the sink.

			WARREN
	Tha's it... be right back!

Warren leaves; the old man starts sliding.

					QUICK CUT TO:

BROMDEN

as Warren enters and takes a firm grip on Bromden's head and
Washington goes to work on Bromden's face. CAMERA PUSHES INTO
EXTREME CLOSEUP of Bromden's fearfully distorted face as the
BUZZING SOUND of the electric razor INTENSIFIES until it is
INSUPPORTABLE.

					QUICK CUT TO:

INT. DAY ROOM - DAY

No sound as we SEE Big Nurse watch the last few patients file
past the side door to the Nurses' Station where Miss Pilbow
hands out little cups with pills. Washington stands by,
checking to see each man takes his pills before filling their
cups with orange juice.
The last patient takes his pills and returns to his place in
the Day Room. Miss Pilbow closes the window.

Satisfied that all is well, Big Nurse turns on an old 45
record player with a stack of records, then she settles down
to her work as a SOFT, NOSTALGIC NUMBER from the '40's is
HEARD OVER LOUDSPEAKER. CAMERA BEGINS SLOW PAN of the Day
Room.

The patients, under the influence of drugs, have settled down
for the day. HARDING is playing cards with MARTINI, CHESWICK
and BILLY. SEFELT and FREDRICKSON are putting a jigsaw puzzle
together in brotherly love. SORENSEN is off by himself,
rubbing his hands clean. TABER, pencil in hand, sits
pondering over a blank piece of paper. SCANLON paces back and
forth. On the Chronics' side of the room, RUCKLY is turning a
grimy photograph over in his hands. BANCINI sits wagging his
head, mumbling over and over, "Tired, awful tired..." ELLIS
stands against the wall, arms outstretched, hands nailed to
the wall by imaginary nails.

Bromden is pushing a mop around. 

Washington, Warren and Miller are in the men's dorm making up
the Chronics' beds when O.S. the TELEPHONE RINGS.

					CUT TO:

INT. NURSES' STATION - DAY

as Miss Pilbow picks up the phone.

			MISS PILBOW
	Eighty-two, Miss Pilbow speaking...
	Yes...
		(she makes a note and
		hangs it)
	... New admission, Miss Ratched...

Miss Pilbow goes to the mirror, quickly preens herself, then
turns and flips the intercom on.

			MISS PILBOW (CONT'D)
		(over loudspeaker)
	Mister Washington! Mister Warren!

She exits.

					CUT TO:

INT. DAY ROOM

as Miss Pilbow exits nurses' station and heads down the
hallway, Washington and Warren on her heels. Miller looking
wistfully after them.

					CUT TO:

INT. MAIN ENTRANCE - STATE HOSPITAL - DAY

Staff personnel are SEEN moving in and out of the main
entrance where a state penitentiary car is parked. A DEPUTY
SHERIFF leans on the fender smoking a cigarette as SECOND
DEPUTY SHERIFF comes out of the building and motions down to
First Deputy, who crushes his cigarette out, then opens the
rear door to the car.

			DEPUTY SHERIFF
		(to an unseen occupant)
	Okay, let's go.

A long beat, then McMurphy slowly emerges from the car. He's
wearing handcuffs and dressed in faded jeans, flannel work
shirt, leather jacket, black motorcycle cap, and heavy black
boots. He's been scrubbed clean and has a Band-Aid on his
cheek. McMurphy does a couple of knee bends to get the kinks
out of his legs as Deputy reaches in the car and takes out a
small gym bag containing McMurphy's belongings.

			DEPUTY SHERIFF (CONT'D)
	Let's move it...

McMurphy goes up the stairs, followed by the Deputy, and
crosses into the building.

INT. MAIN BUILDING - DAY

as McMurphy enters the building followed by the Deputies,
where Nurse Pilbow, McMurphy's folder in hand, and Washington
and Warren stand waiting -- all in a pleasant, receptive
mood. First Deputy hands McMurphy's gym bag to Washington,
who hands it to Warren.

			SECOND DEPUTY
	Okay, this is it!

McMurphy turns and holds out his hands. As cuffs are removed,
McMurphy impulsively takes hold of the Deputy's head and
plants a kiss on his forehead.

			SECOND DEPUTY (CONT'D)
		(squirming out of
		McMurphy's grasp)
	Jesus, you're crazy, McMurphy.

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah, ain't that the truth.

			DEPUTY SHERIFF
		(to Miss Pilbow)
	He's all yours, Miss.

			MISS PILBOW
	Thank you, Officer...

The two Deputies start down the stairs.

			MCMURPHY
	So long, fellas...

The two Deputies merely shrug their backs at McMurphy who
takes a deep breath of fresh air.

			MCMURPHY (CONT'D)
	Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall
	day...

			MISS PILBOW
	This way, Mister McMurphy.

			MCMURPHY
	Yes, ma'am...

McMurphy follows Nurse Pilbow into the hallway as the door
closes behind them.

					CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Other STAFF MEMBERS are administrative personnel are SEEN as
McMurphy walks alongside Nurse Pilbow, who is noticeably
nervous by his close proximity. Washington and Warren
casually bringing up the rear.

			MCMURPHY
		(as he peels the Band-Aid
		off, revealing a scar)
	I tell ya, these goons showered me
	at the courthouse this morning,
	last night at the jail, and I swear
	they'd have swabbed my ears out on
	the way over if they could've found
	the facilities...

A young Japanese nurse, named ITSU, passes by.

			MCMURPHY (CONT'D)
		(to Nurse Itsu)
	Hey, how ya doin', cutie?

			NURSE ITSU
	Okay. How you doing?

			MCMURPHY
	Just great!
		(calling after her)
	See ya around!

Nurse Itsu laughs and disappears around the corner.

			MCMURPHY (CONT'D)
		(to Nurse Pilbow)
	Yes, sir, I sure am gonna enjoy my
	stay here.

			MISS PILBOW
	I'm sure you will.

			MCMURPHY
		(to Nurse Pilbow)
	Ya know, I ain't never been in an
	institution of psychology before.

			MISS PILBOW
	Oh...

They arrive at the ward door. Nurse Pilbow unlocks the door
and opens it as...

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah, I'm here on a ninety-day
	observation period. Short-timer,
	like they say...

Soft nostalgic MUSIC is HEARD OVER.

			MISS PILBOW
	Of course.
		(indicating door)
	Mister McMurphy.

			MCMURPHY
	After you, ma'am.

			MISS PILBOW
	Thank you.

Nurse Pilbow enters the ward and McMurphy watches her cross
the visitors' area to a heavy-gauge steel screen wall, with
security gate which she opens.

			MCMURPHY
		(to Washington and Warren
		as they step into ward)
	Man, there sure is an awful lot of
	poontang around here.

			SPIVEY
		(calling)
	Hold it!

McMurphy turns to see DOCTOR SPIVEY approaching.

			SPIVEY (CONT'D)
	Good morning, boys.

			WASHINGTON AND WARREN
		(simultaneously as Spivey
		passes into the ward)
	Mornin', Doctor Spivey.

			SPIVEY
	Great day for fishing.

			WASHINGTON AND WARREN
		(simultaneously)
	Yes, sir!

The door closes. CAMERA HOLDS on sign that READS: 

SMILE AT THE NEXT FACE YOU SEE. IT MAY SAVE HIS LIFE.

			MCMURPHY (O.S.)
	Yeah, I was just thinking the same
	thing, Doc...

					CUT TO:

INT. WARD - DAY

as McMurphy, Spivey, Washington and Warren cross the
visitors' area towards Nurse Pilbow, who stands holding the
security gate open. At the far end of the hallway, which
opens into the day room, patients can be seen.

			SPIVEY
		(to McMurphy)
	Oh, what's that?

			MCMURPHY
	Why, I'll betcha there must be a
	million albacore and tuna running
	of the coast right this minute.

			SPIVEY
	Oh, do you do much fishing?

As they pass through the security gate:

			MCMURPHY
	Fish! Hell, Doc, I'd like to have a
	nickel for every fish I landed
	between Point Conception and the
	Alaska coast...

Washington and Warren continue down the hallway, passing
SEFELT, who shyly approaches and waits at a respectful
distance.

			SPIVEY
		(to McMurphy)
	Is that so?

			MCMURPHY
	Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay
	for just about every season since I
	was able to haul my own weight.

			SPIVEY
	My, my... Ah, who are you?

			MCMURPHY
	McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.

They shake hands.

			NURSE PILBOW
	Mister McMurphy is a new admission.

			SPIVEY
	Ah, yes. Well, we must talk soon,
	Mister McMurphy.

			MCMURPHY
	You bet, Doc.

Spivey turns to Sefelt.

			SPIVEY
	Good morning, Jim. How are you
	feeling?

			SEFELT
		(approaching and pointing
		to his mouth)
	Doc, my gungs hurt me.

Spivey starts checking out Sefelt's mouth.

			NURSE PILBOW
	This way, Mister McMurphy.

As McMurphy follows Nurse Pilbow down the hall, Spivey's
voice trails after him.

			SPIVEY (O.S.)
	Have you been taking your Dilantin,
	Jim?

			SEFELT (O.S.)
	Uh-huh...

			SPIVEY (O.S.)
	Well, we'll send you over to the
	dentist and see what he can do.
	Okay?

			SEFELT (O.S.)
	Okay, Doc!

McMurphy and Nurse Pilbow reach the day room.

			MISS PILBOW
	Make yourself at home, Mister
	McMurphy...

			MCMURPHY
	Thank you, ma'am,

Nurse Pilbow enters the nurses' station, closing the door
behind her. Next to the door is a bulletin board which, among
other bits of information, READS: 

TODAY IS MONDAY SEPTEMBER 30, 1963. THE NEXT MEAL IS LUNCH.
THE NEXT HOLIDAY IS HALLOWEEN.

Another notice READS: 

SIGN UP NOW! BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT STAFF VS PATIENTS.
Washington, Warren, Miller

There are no other names listed. Sefelt passes by.

			MCMURPHY (CONT'D)
	Hi.

			SEFELT
	Hi.

Sefelt crosses into the day room where he joins Fredrickson,
who is putting a jigsaw puzzle together.

INT. DAY ROOM - DAY

as McMurphy drifts into the room and looks around. The room
is as it was. The MUSIC ENDS. There is a CLICK. McMurphy's
attention is drawn to the nurses' station.

McMURPHY'S POV OF NURSES' STATION

where Miss Pilbow is SEEN through a large plate glass window,
busy typing a nameplate for McMurphy.

Big Nurse, her back to McMurphy, is turning over a stack of
records. She presses the phonograph button. A record falls on
the turntable and MUSIC BEGINS as she turns and sees
McMurphy.

ANOTHER ANGLE

McMurphy smiles and tips his hat to Big Nurse. 

Big Nurse smiles back and takes her seat. 

McMurphy turns and drifts into the day room. 

Big Nurse looks up and studies him. 

McMurphy catches the eye of a PATIENT, sitting by himself.

			MCMURPHY
	How ya doin', buddy?

			PATIENT
	Poorly, thank you.

			MCMURPHY
	Oh, yeah? What's ailing ya?

			PATIENT
	I got the fever.

			MCMURPHY
	Well, that's too bad...

Taber, pencil and paper in hand, crosses to McMurphy and taps
him on the shoulder.

			MCMURPHY (CONT'D)
	Yeah, buddy?

			TABER
	Are you a doctor?

			MCMURPHY
	No, 'fraid not...

Taber walks away.

Martini tugs at McMurphy's sleeve.

			MCMURPHY (CONT'D)
	Yeah, buddy?

			MARTINI
	Can you borrow me a dime?

			MCMURPHY
	Sorry, buddy, I'm clean outta
	change...

Scanlon moves in.

			SCANLON
	Got a cigarette?

			MCMURPHY
	Sure...

			MARTINI
	Me too! Me too!

As McMurphy hands out his cigarettes Bromden drifts by, mop
in hand.

			MCMURPHY
	Hey, how's it look up there, big
	boy?

			SCANLON
	He can't hear you. He's just a deaf
	and dumb Indian!

			MCMURPHY
	That right?

			HARDING (O.S.)
	Martini, it's your turn!

Martini is staring off into space.

			HARDING (O.S.) (CONT'D)
	Martini!

			MCMURPHY
		(to Martini)
	Your buddy is callin' ya.

Martini crosses back to the card game as Taber returns.

			MCMURPHY
	What's troubling ya, buddy?

			TABER
	I want you to write me a letter to
	my brother for a hundred dollars to
	bury me.

			MCMURPHY
	You look pretty healthy to me.

			TABER (CONT'D)
	I'm the next one.

			MCMURPHY
	How do ya know that?

			TABER (CONT'D)
	Because I quit breathing.

			MCMURPHY
	You're breathin' right now.

Taber walks away.

McMurphy watches him go.

Nearby, an OLD VEGETABLE squeaks.

			MCMURPHY
		(crossing to him)
	What's that, Pop?

The old man squeaks again.

			MCMURPHY
		(leaning in close)
	Can't hear ya, old-timer.

			OLD VEGETABLE
	Ain't this a pisser?

			MCMURPHY
	Hell, compared to where I just come
	from, this is a country club.

McMurphy crosses to the card game and stands watching the
game.

			MCMURPHY
	Whatcha boys playin'?

			BILLY
	H-H-Hearts.

			MCMURPHY
	Shoot! No wonder you don't care
	nothin' 'bout showin' your hand.

Billy holds his hand close to his chest.

			MCMURPHY
	What's your name, buddy?

			BILLY
	B-B-Billy.

			MCMURPHY
	Well, put 'er there, Billy boy, my
	name's McMurphy.

They shake hands.

			MCMURPHY
	What I wanna know is who's the top
	loony around here?

			BILLY (CONT'D)
	Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president
	of the P-P-Patients C-Council?

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah, that'll do for openers!

			BILLY (CONT'D)
		(to Harding)
	H-H-Harding, the m-m-man w-wants to
	t-talk to you, y-you're the pr-pr
	pr...

			HARDING
	Does he have an appointment?

			CHESWICK
	Yeah, do you have an appointment?

			MCMURPHY
	What for?

			CHESWICK
		(to Harding)
	What for?

			HARDING
	I'm a busy man!

			CHESWICK
		(to McMurphy)
	He's a busy man!

A beat; then:

			MCMURPHY
	I can wait...

McMurphy picks up a chair and sits down right next to Harding
and looks at him. Another beat; then:

			HARDING
		(to McMurphy)
	What are you doing?

			MCMURPHY
	I'm seeing what a busy man does.

Harding, very nervous at McMurphy's proximity, turns back to
the game.

			HARDING
	Your turn, Martini!

Martini is lost in the clouds.

			HARDING (CONT'D)
	Martini, throw a card!

Martini throws a diamond.

			HARDING (CONT'D)
	No, throw a club!

			CHESWICK
	Yeah, throw a club!

Martini throws a spade.

			HARDING
	Don't you have any clubs?

			MARTINI
	No!

			HARDING
	Let me see your hand!

			MARTINI
	No!

			HARDING
		(slamming his cards)
	Well, if you gentlemen will excuse
	me, I have some pressing matters to
	attend to.

Harding gets up and crosses to the hallway, gathering his
pride as he goes.

McMurphy slides into Harding's seat and rakes all the cards
in.

			MCMURPHY
	Yessir, that's why I came to this
	establishment for, to bring you
	birds fun and entertainment 'round
	the gamin' table...

McMurphy fans the deck out and lays it on the table.
Everyone's eyes pop as he scoops the cards up in one movement
-- he's a card shark, a magician -- leaving the Acutes with
their mouths hanging open.

			MCMURPHY
	Easy now, don't smudge 'em, we got
	lots of games ahead of us...

			BIG NURSE (O.S.)
	Mister McMurphy!

McMurphy turns to see Big Nurse approaching, Washington
casually bringing up the rear.

			MCMURPHY
	Yes, ma'am...

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
		(handing him his bag)
	Will you come with me, please.

			MCMURPHY
		(rising)
	Hold the fort down, will ya,
	fellas!

			BILLY
	Sure, Mack!

McMurphy walks with her toward the men's dorm.

			BIG NURSE
	My name is Miss Ratched. I'm the
	head nurse here. You've already met
	Miss Pilbow and Aides Washington
	and Warren.

			MCMURPHY
	Yes, ma'am.

Big Nurse and McMurphy stop at the security gate to the men's
dorm where Miller opens the gate.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Mister Miller, this is Mister
	McMurphy, who'll be staying with
	us.

Greetings are exchanged as they pass through.

INT. MEN'S DORM - DAY

as Big Nurse and McMurphy cross down the aisle.

			BIG NURSE
	We do appreciate the way you have
	taken it upon yourself to meet the
	other patients.

			MCMURPHY
	Thank you, ma'am...

Big Nurse stops at an empty bed where Warren is turning the
mattress down.

			BIG NURSE
	This is your bed. You may leave
	your things in that cabinet.

			MCMURPHY
	Yes, ma'am...

			BIG NURSE
	Please use your time to familiarize
	yourself with your new home and if
	there is anything you need to know,
	don't hesitate to ask us.

			MCMURPHY
	Now that you mention it, I sure
	would like to call my aunt up in
	Portland and tell 'er where I am so
	she can come visit me.

			BIG NURSE 
	All in good time, Mister McMurphy.
	All in good time.

			MCMURPHY
	Yes, ma'am.

			BIG NURSE 
	Good. Now if you'll just go along
	with Mister Washington, he'll see
	that you're properly oriented.

McMurphy doesn't move.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Is there anything else?

			MCMURPHY
	Just that I'm glad to be here, Miss
	Ratched. I really am.

			BIG NURSE 
	Good. I'm sure we'll be friends.

They smile, sizing up each other.

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking
	for a head nurse.

			BIG NURSE
	Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy.
	Go along.

			MCMURPHY
	Yes, ma'am.
		(to Washington)
	Lead the way, Sam.

They cross out of the men's dorm.

Big Nurse watches them go.

			SPIVEY (V.O.)
	What other work have you done?

INT. DOCTOR SPIVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

Doctor Spivey is seated behind his desk, on which are several
glass-framed photos of Spivey's family, plus a nameplate:
JOHN M. SPIVEY, M.D., and McMurphy's papers.

McMurphy, freshly showered and wearing hospital-issue
clothes, sits facing him.

			MCMURPHY
	Hell, Doc, I've been everything
	from a hoopla man with a two-bit
	carny show to a top mechanic and
	bull goose catskinner for every
	gypo loggin' operation in the
	Northwest till the Army taught me
	what my natural bent was.

			SPIVEY
	Oh, what was that?

			MCMURPHY
	Poker!

			SPIVEY 
	I see.

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah, but you know how society
	persecutes a dedicated man.

			SPIVEY (CONT'D)
	In what way?

			MCMURPHY
	They say I'm a habitual hassler.
	Like I fight some. Sheeut. They
	didn't mind so much when I was a
	dumb logger and got into a hassle.
	That's a hardworkin' feller blowing
	off steam, they say. But if you're
	a gambler, all you have to do is
	spit slantwise and you're a
	goddamned criminal.

			SPIVEY
	I see...

			MCMURPHY
	To tell the truth, ever since I
	found my natural callin' I done
	time in so many small-time jails I
	could write a brochure...

			SPIVEY 
	Yes... Ah, do you know why you're
	here?

			MCMURPHY
	Well, ya know, Doc...
		(indicating his papers)
	Doesn't it say so there?

			SPIVEY 
		(looking over papers)
	Well, according to the Warden at
	Pendleton, you were a disturbing
	influence on others. 'It appears
	that there is a potential in him
	for instigating a revolt among the
	other inmates.'
		(looking up at McMurphy)
	What do you think of that report?

			MCMURPHY
	I don't, Doc...

			SPIVEY 
		(goes back to papers)
	Arrested on an assault charge five
	times...

			MCMURPHY
	That's correct, Doc ...

			SPIVEY
		(reading from folder)
	The doctor at the prison states:
	'Don't overlook the possibility
	that this man may be faking
	psychosis to escape the drudgery of
	the work farm...' What do you say
	to that?

			MCMURPHY
	Doc, what can I tell ya?

			SPIVEY
	Ah, it seems you have no other
	psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?

			MCMURPHY
	No, this is my first trip, Doc.

			SPIVEY
		(closes folder and sits
		back)
	Well, you're here for a ninety-day
	observation period, Mister
	McMurphy. I'd like you to
	understand you are here on a court
	order and we are responsible to the
	state. So, I'd like your
	cooperation!

			MCMURPHY
	You bet, Doc!

			SPIVEY
	Good. Good.

INT. DAY ROOM - DAY

CAMERA is on Big Nurse as she stands, in front of a chair,
doing a deep breathing exercise.

The patients and staff, standing in front of chairs arranged
in a circle, follow suit as best they can. After a couple of
exercises Big Nurse sits. The others do the same except
Bancini, who remains standing, wagging his head back and
forth.

			BANCINI
	I'm tired. Whew. O Lord. Oh, I'm
	awful tired...

			BIG NURSE
		(busy with her papers)
	Somebody please see to Mister
	Bancini, so we can start the
	meeting.

Billy does... gently laying a hand on Bancini.

			BILLY
	T-t-t-take it e-e-easy, P-P-P
	Pete...

			BANCINI
	Awful tired...

Billy gently eases Bancini into his chair and sits beside
him, patting his skinny knee.

			BIG NURSE
	At the close of Friday's meeting,
	we were discussing Mister Harding's
	problem, concerning his wife...
		(reading from logbook)
	Mister Harding stated that his wife
	made him uneasy because she drew
	stares from men on the street. Is
	that correct, Mister Harding?

			HARDING
	Yes, that's perfectly correct.

			BIG NURSE
		(reading)
	He also thinks he may have given
	her reason to seek sexual attention
	elsewhere, but he didn't say how.
	He has been heard to say to his
	wife, 'I hate you, I don't ever
	want to see you again. You've
	betrayed me.'
		(she closes book)
	So. Does anyone care to touch upon
	this further?

Big Nurse waits. A long beat.

Harding sits, chewing his nails, tensely waiting, almost
wanting someone to begin.

The patients shift uncomfortably, looking in all directions.

McMurphy looks around to see what will follow, when he sees
Ellis, nailed to the wall; his pants leg darkens and a puddle
of piss forms at his feet. McMurphy looks to see if Big Nurse
or the Aides have noticed.

If they have, no one pays any attention.

McMurphy fidgets in his seat, then gets up, crosses to Ellis,
unhooks him from the wall, and moves him over a few feet.

The other patients are aghast at this move, look at each
other quizzically.

Big Nurse merely watches.

McMurphy crosses back to his chair and sits.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Mister McMurphy, this ward is a
	democratic community run by the
	patients and their votes, so you
	should feel at ease in your new
	surroundings to the extent you can
	freely discuss emotional problems
	in front of the patients and staff.
	However, the cardinal rule, and I
	must emphasize this: Everyone keeps
	their seat during the meeting!

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah, well, it just pains me
	somethin' awful to see a full
	growed man sloshing around in his
	own water...

			BIG NURSE
	Yes... We were discussing Mister
	Harding's problem with his wife.
	Now, who will start?
		(no response)
	Billy.

			BILLY
	M-m-m-ma'am?

			BIG NURSE
	Would you like to start?

			BILLY
	N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.

			BIG NURSE
	Mister Sefelt?

Sefelt shrugs and sinks into his seat.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Mister Fredrickson?

Fredrickson passes.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Mister Taber?

Taber passes.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Mister Martini?

			MARTINI
	No!

			BIG NURSE
	Mister Scanlon?

Scanlon looks at the floor.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Mister Cheswick?

Cheswick wags his head 'no.'

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Am I to take it that there isn't a
	man among you who has an opinion
	concerning this matter?
		(no response; she focuses
		in on Harding)
	Mister Harding, you've stated on
	more than one occasion that you
	suspected your wife of seeing other
	men.

			HARDING
	Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.

			BIG NURSE
	But you have no proof.

			HARDING
	No, Miss Ratched...

			BIG NURSE
	And yet you suspect her.

			HARDING
	Yes, that is correct.

			BIG NURSE
	Why?

			HARDING
	I can only speculate as to the
	reasons why.

			BIG NURSE
	Have you ever speculated, Mister
	Harding, that you are impatient
	with your wife because she does not
	meet your mental requirements?

One of the Chronics laughs like a child.

			HARDING
	Miss Ratched. Given all the
	conditions of that sublime
	relationship, coupled with the
	subsequent annihilation of all that
	I held to be sacred, mentally,
	physically and emotionally, the
	only thing that I can speculate on,
	at this late date, is how I will
	justify the very existence of my
	life, with or without my dear wife.

			SEFELT
	What's he talkin' about?

			TABER
	Yeah, Harding, why don't you
	knockoff the bullshit and get to
	the point.

Several Acutes chime in, "Yeah, get to the point," AD LIB.

			HARDING
	The point is, I will carry on until
	I fully understand what the
	function of that relationship is
	regardless of form or content.

Several hands go up.

			BIG NURSE
	Yes, Billy?

			BILLY
	I-I-I-I-I d-d-don't s-s-see how
	anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man
	who t-t-t-talks the way he does.

			TABER
	Yeah, Harding, you're so fuckin'
	dumb I can't believe it.

			HARDING
	That's a matter of opinion.

			SEFELT
	Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe
	anyway?

			FREDRICKSON
	Through the ass.

Sefelt and Fredrickson snicker into their hands. A few of the
others laugh.

			HARDING
		(smarting)
	Is that your sense of humor or are
	you trying to say something?

			FREDRICKSON
		(innocence itself)
	Now what would I be trying to say?

			HARDING
	I don't know. I don't know, but it
	makes me feel very peculiar when
	you throw in something like that.

			FREDRICKSON
	Peculiar?

			SEFELT
	Why?

			TABER
	Yeah, why?

			SCANLON
	Yeah, tell us why.

			HARDING
	I hesitate to go on.

			BIG NURSE
	No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's
	get it all out in the open...

			HARDING
	I mean, the other day you made an
	allusion to my wife and the
	possible sexual problems we might
	be having. I know that to be the
	case, but the way in which you
	broached it, if that's your idea of
	teaching me something...

			HARDING (CONT'D)
		(his voice rising as he
		goes on)
	... or making me aware of a
	condition in my life, then I say,
	categorically speaking, the hell
	with you, Taber!
	I don't have to justify the
	condition of my life to you or any
	of you. No matter what I will carry
	on until I fully understand what
	that function is regardless of the
	form or content. Regardless of the
	fact we must try to understand the
	function of our capacity to obtain,
	to personify the condition, the
	condition of our existence, our
	existence...

			TABER
	You know what, Harding? I think
	you're some kind of morbid asshole
	or something. You've been talking
	about your wife evere since I can
	remember. You know, she's on your
	mind and blah, blah, blah and on
	and on and when are you going to
	wise up and turn her loose!

			FREDRICKSON
	Yeah, wise up, Harding.

			SEFELT
	Yeah, turn her loose!

			ACUTES
		(start pouring it on)
	Yeah, who do you think you are
	anyway?... He thinks he's God
	Almighty... He's a snob... He's a
	schmuck... Dumbbell... Creep...
	Cretin... Idiot... Get rid of
	him... Ship him upstairs...

			RUCKLY
		(chiming in)
	Ffffffuck da wife...

			BANCINI
		(wagging his head)
	Tired... Awful tired...

			ACUTES
		(not letting up)
	Zap him... Give 'im lobotomy... Cut
	his nuts off... He doesn't have
	any... Fag... Pervert.

			BANCINI
		(in a strong angry voice)
	I'm tired!

Everyone hushes.

			BIG NURSE
	Somebody see to Mister Bancini.

Two or three Acutes get up and try to soothe Bancini, but he
isn't to be hushed.

			BANCINI
	Tired. Tired. Oh God, I'm tired...

Big Nurse nods to Washington, who goes to Pete, and gives his
arm a jerk toward the door. Bancini is unmovable.

Big Nurse signals Nurse Pilbow, who heads for the nurses'
station.

Washington senses danger, lets go of Pete's arm, backs away.

			WASHINGTON
	You a good boy, Mistah Bancini...

Nurse Pilbow returns, hypodermic needle in hand.

Pete turns to his fellow inmates.

			BANCINI
	You see... it's a lotta baloney...
	It's all a lotta baloney...

			NURSE PILBOW
	Yes, yes, Mister Bancini, now if
	you'll just be calm...

			BANCINI
	That's all it is, just a lotta
	baloney. Ya see, I can't help it,
	can't...

			NURSE PILBOW
		(working her way around
		Bancini)
	Yes, I know, I know...

She gets him in the ass, with the needle, and springs back.

			BANCINI
	... don't ya see. I was born dead.
	Not you. You wasn't born dead.
	Ahhh, it's been so hard...
		(starts going over,
		slowly; sighing and
		crying)
	Tired... I'm tired... aw-ful
	tired...

McMurphy looks around at the others.

Each patient is locked in his own world -- oblivious to
Bancini's state.

EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY

WIDE SHOT of entire court, surrounded by a high fence topped
off with barbed wire, as Washington and Warren escort the
Acutes -- including Bromden, Ellis, a lobotomy case and
several other Chronics -- through the gate onto the court,
which is run down, with cracks in its surface and leaves
scattered everywhere.

Martini, who is carrying the ball, runs ahead, followed by
Scanlon, where he starts dribbling the ball in a frantic
circle, suddenly passes the ball to nothing.

			MARTINI
		(as he throws ball)
	Catch it! Catch it!

The ball rolls to the corner.

			WASHINGTON
	Martini, there ain't nobody there,
	ya dumb goon! Go get the ball!

			MARTINI
	No!

Martini turns away, his feelings hurt. Washington goes after
the ball, when Martini goes running after it.

			MARTINI (CONT'D)
	I get it! I get it!

But Washington gives Martini a body check and beats him to
the ball.

Martini tries to get the ball from Washington, who is quite
agile and teases him as he returns to the court where he and
Warren start shooting baskets, freezing Martini and Scanlon
out.

The other patients just hang around or walk, as if in a
prison yard.

Cheswick stands in close proximity to McMurphy and Harding,
who stand watching the action. McMurphy finally offers a
cigarette to Harding, who accepts. They both light up.

			MCMURPHY
	Well, say, buddy, is that the usual
	pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py
	shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a
	peckin' party?

			HARDING
	A pecking party?

			MCMURPHY
	That's right, buddy. And you want
	to know who pecks the first peck?

			HARDING AND CHESWICK
	Who? Who?

			MCMURPHY
	Ah, come off it! It's that Big
	Nurse, that's who...

The other Acutes have gathered around McMurphy and Harding.

			HARDING
	It's as simple as that. You've been
	on our ward six hours and have
	already simplified the work of
	Freud, Jung and Maxwell Jones in
	one grand analogy: it's a pecking
	party.

			MCMURPHY
	I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or
	Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm
	talkin' about is that crummy
	meeting and what that nurse did to
	you!

			HARDING
	Did to me?

			MCMURPHY
	Did to you and all the rest of you
	guys.

			BILLY
	Y-y-yes! Yes! Y-y-y-you s-s-saw wh
	wh-what she c-c-can do to us!

			MCMURPHY
	What did I see 'cept a grown man
	gettin' whipped so bad he can't
	laugh anymore.

			FREDRICKSON
	It's the questions she asks.

			MCMURPHY
	Tell 'er to go straight to hell!

			HARDING
	Miss Ratched is a competent
	psychiatric nurse, not some, some
	kind of monster pecking out our
	eyes!

			MCMURPHY
		(as calm as blue waters)
	She ain't peckin' at your eyes,
	buddy.

McMurphy grabs Harding by his balls and Harding goes up on
his toes.

			MCMURPHY
	She's peckin' at your balls, buddy,
	at your ever-lovin' balls.

Harding is doubled over.

			SEFELT
	That kind of behavior will get you
	a P.A. rating, my friend.

			MCMURPHY
	P.A. What the hell is that?

			SEFELT 
	Potential assaultive.

			FREDRICKSON
	Which gets you shipped up to
	Disturbed for a nice little zap
	job.

			MCMURPHY
	Huh?

			HARDING
	Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend.
	Five cents' worth of electricity
	and you are out of everybody's
	hair.

			MCMURPHY
	Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!

			HARDING (CONT'D)
	And if you persist in your ways,
	they can always ship you over to
	Medical Surgery.

			MCMURPHY
	What for?

			HARDING (CONT'D)
	Lobotomy!

			MCMURPHY
	Lobotomy?

			HARDING (CONT'D)
		(pointing to lobotomy
		case)
	That!

McMurphy looks.

SHOT OF A LOBOTOMY CASE

A vegetable, complete with two half-dollar scars in his
forehead.

McMURPHY

As he absorbs this bit of information the basketball rolls to
his feet and he picks it up.

			MCMURPHY
		(to Harding)
	Is that your sense of humor or are
	you tryin' to say somethin'?

			HARDING
	Now, what would I be trying to say?

Martini and Scanlon rush over and try to get the ball.

			SCANLON
	Gimme the ball!

			MARTINI
	No. Me! Me!

			WASHINGTON (O.S.)
	Pass the ball, McMurphy.

McMurphy crosses to the court, bouncing the ball as he goes.
When he reaches the court he holds the ball out to
Washington, who reaches for it, but McMurphy snaps it back
over his shoulder to Martini.

			MCMURPHY
		(turning to Martini)
	Pass it to me, Martini.

Martini holds back.

			MCMURPHY
	C'mon, I'll give it back!

Martini passes to McMurphy.

			MCMURPHY
	Atta boy, Martini.

He passes it back to Martini, who laughs and passes it back
to McMurphy, who passes it to Scanlon, who passes to
McMurphy, who passes to Billy, etc. Bromden just stands
watching.

			MCMURPHY
		(encouraging them)
	Back and forth, that's it. Shoot,
	man, we'll be takin' on the New
	York Knicks before we're through...

McMurphy looks to see Big Nurse looking out a window at them.
He catches her eye. She turns away.

			MCMURPHY (V.O)
	Hey-ya, hey-ya, come on, come on,
	I'm waitin' on you suckers, you hit
	or you sit...

INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT

The MUSIC is PLAYING. The TV is on the six o'clock news as
McMurphy, cards in hand, is dealing blackjack to Cheswick,
Harding, Sefelt, Billy and Martini. Fredrickson and Scanlon
are looking on as Bromden eases up to the game. Cheswick is
at the nurses' station talking to Big Nurse.

			SEFELT
	Hit me!

			MCMURPHY
	Hit, you say? Well well well and
	with a king up, the boy wants a
	hit. Whadaya know.
	So comin' at you and too bad, a
	little lady for the lad and he's
	over the wall and down the road, up
	the hill and dropped his load.

			SEFELT
	Boogered!

McMurphy rakes in Sefelt's cigarettes, adding them to a pile
of loose cigarettes, packs of cigarettes, several cartons of
cigarettes.

As Cheswick sits down, depressed:

			MCMURPHY
	'Kay, place your bets.

			MARTINI
		(holding up a cigarette)
	What's this?

			MCMURPHY
	That's a dime, Martini.

Martini breaks a cigarette in half.

			MARTINI (CONT'D)
	Bet a nickel!

			MCMURPHY
		(to Cheswick)
	Whadaya bet, Cheswick?

			CHESWICK
	She won't give me any more
	cigarettes!

			MCMURPHY
	That okay. I'll take your marker.
	How many ya want?

			CHESWICK (CONT'D)
	Lend me twenty.

McMurphy counts out twenty cigarettes, marks it down on a
piece of paper, and passes the cigarettes to Cheswick, who
bets all twenty.

The Sports have come on TV and McMurphy's attention is
divided.

			MCMURPHY
		(checking the board)
	'Kay, all bets are down, let's
	wheel 'em an' deal 'em.

He deals the cards out, the first one face down, then the
next one face up.

			MCMURPHY
	Big king... little deuce... another
	king... a lovely lady... big ten...
	and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya
	say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?

			MARTINI
	Hit me.

			MCMURPHY
		(hits with a picture)
	That's twenty up, Martini.
		(turning to TV, he shouts
		across room)
	Hey, Taber, who's pitching the
	opening game?

Taber calls back something but it's lost in the other sounds.

			MARTINI (CONT'D)
	Hit me!

			MCMURPHY
	Wait a minute, Martini, I can't
	hear a thing.
		(turning back to Taber)
	What?

			TABER
		(shouting back)
	Koufax against Ford!

			MISS PILBOW (V.O.)
		(over loudspeaker)
	Medication time! Medication time!
	Medication!

			MARTINI
		(simultaneously with
		Pilbow)
	Hit me!

McMurphy slams his cards down, stands up, crosses the day
room, heading for the nurses' station. He passes Washington,
who stands there waiting to dispense orange juice.

INT. NURSES' STATION - NIGHT

as McMurphy enters. Nurse Pilbow is the only one there.

			MCMURPHY
	Pardon me miss, but would you mind
	turning...

			NURSE PILBOW
		(scared out of her wits)
	Stay back! Patients aren't allowed
	to enter the... Oh, stay back!

			MCMURPHY
	All I'm askin' is...

Nurse Pilbow grabs at her cross, screams and shuts her eyes,
holding the cross in front of her.

			NURSE PILBOW (CONT'D)
	Oh, stay back, I'm a Catholic!

Big Nurse enters from the nurses' lounge.

			BIG NURSE
	Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't
	allowed in here.

			MCMURPHY
	Sorry, ma'am.

McMurphy steps out of the station, closing the door behind
him.

INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT

as McMurphy goes around to the front of the nurses' station
and queues up behind the other Acutes who are getting their
medication. McMurphy reaches the window, takes the cup, but
doesn't take his pills.

			MCMURPHY
		(to Big Nurse)
	Pardon me, ma'am, can I ask you
	somethin'?

			BIG NURSE
		(politely)
	Yes, Mister McMurphy?

			MCMURPHY
	How 'bout turning off that music
	for a while so a man can hear
	himself think?

			BIG NURSE
		(pleasantly)
	That music is for everyone, Mister
	McMurphy.

McMurphy leans in, placing his hand on the window.

			MCMURPHY
		(confidentially)
	Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down
	a bit so a man don't have to shout!

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
		(aware of his physical
		proximity)
	Mister McMurphy, there are old men
	here who couldn't hear the music at
	all if it were lower. That music is
	all they have, and I wish you
	wouldn't lean against the glass
	there, your hands are staining the
	window.

McMurphy jerks his hand away.

			MCMURPHY
	Sorry, ma'am... Sorry 'bout that...

McMurphy breathes on the glass and wipes it clean with his
sleeve.

			MCMURPHY
	Sorry to have bothered you.

			BIG NURSE 
	Not at all, Mister McMurphy...

McMurphy turns to walk away.

			NURSE PILBOW
	Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.

			MCMURPHY
		(turning back, he examines
		the contents of the cup)
	What's the horse pill for, honey?

			NURSE PILBOW
	It's just medication, Mister
	McMurphy, good for you. Now down it
	goes...

			MCMURPHY
	Look, miss, I don't like swallowing
	something without knowing what it
	is!

			NURSE PILBOW 
		(stepping back a little)
	Don't get upset, Mister McMurphy...

			MCMURPHY
	I'm not upset. All I wanna know,
	for the lovva Jesus...

			BIG NURSE
	That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if
	Mister McMurphy does not wish to
	take his medication orally, he
	may...

			MCMURPHY
	No, that's okay, ma'am. Down it
	goes.

McMurphy makes a big show of popping the pill in his mouth,
holding his paper cup upside down, for all to see, then
moving on to Washington, who fills it with orange juice.

McMurphy gulps it down, not without some difficulty, then he
smiles at all the concerned faces and crosses the room to the
card table, where he sits to see the Acutes looking at him.

			HARDING
	Why didn't you tell her to go to
	hell, lover boy?

			TABER
	Yeah, whattsa matter, Mack, she too
	much for ya?

McMurphy holds the pill up and flicks it into Harding's
forehead.

			MCMURPHY
	You boys seem to think you've got a
	champ in there, huh?

			HARDING
	I don't see you scoring any points,
	buddy. And you're just the man for
	the job, right?

			MCMURPHY
	Hell, I couldn't get it up over old
	hatchet-face if ya paid me!

			HARDING (CONT'D)
	She's not all that homely, Mister
	McMurphy. In fact, she must have
	been a rather beautiful young lady.

The men look at Big Nurse.

The patients look at the nurses' station.

PATIENTS' POV

Big Nurse is busy at her work.

INT. NURSES STATION - BIG NURSE'S POV - NIGHT

The patients looking at her. They turn back to their card
game.

REVERSE ANGLE

CAMERA HOLDS on Big Nurse as McMurphy's VOICE is HEARD over
INTERCOM.

			MCMURPHY (V.O.)
		(through intercom)
	Yeah, an' I'm tellin' ya, she's
	just an icy-hearted over-the-hump
	gal who never got enough of the old
	wham-bam to straighten 'er out...
	Okay, who wants a card?

			MARTINI (V.O.)
		(through intercom)
	Me. Hit me!

Big Nurse looks up and studies the men gathered round the
table.

INT. MEN'S DORM - NIGHT

The patients are asleep except for Bromden, who stands by the
window looking out.

McMurphy is asleep in the bed next to his. A beat when
TURKLE, a fifty-year-old Negro night attendant, slightly
drunk, lays a gentle hand on Bromden's shoulder.

			TURKLE
	Le's get back to bed, Mistah
	Bromden...

Bromden allows himself to be led back to bed. Turkle fumbles
around for the security belt, finds it, straps Bromden
loosely in bed, then goes off clucking to himself.

Bromden reaches under his bed and plucks a stale piece of gum
from under the bed frame. He starts chewing it when he sees
McMurphy looking at him.

Bromden goes right on chewing and looking McMurphy right in
the eye.

			MCMURPHY
		(whispering)
	Chief? I wanna ask ya somethin'.
		(sings)
	Oh, does the spearmint lose its
	flavor on the bedpost overnight?
	When you chew it in the morning,
	will it be too hard to bite? This
	question's got me goin', won't
	somebody set me right; does the
	spearmint lose its flavor on the
	bedpost overnight?

McMurphy holds the last note, reaches over and rustles
through his nightstand.

			MCMURPHY
	Here ya go, Chief...

A small object lands on Bromden's bed. It is a fresh package
of gum. Bromden picks it up. Examines it. Unwraps it.
Deposits his old piece of gum under the bed frame, then
inserts the fresh gum in his mouth and starts chewing.

SERIES OF SHOTS

SHOWING the MEN'S DORM, the empty DAY ROOM, TURKLE ASLEEP in
the NURSES' STATION, EMPTY HALLWAYS, the NIGHT SUPERINTENDENT
AT HER DESK, MORE HALLWAYS... ENDING ON:

INT. MEN'S DORM - SUNRISE

ABERRATED SHOT of INSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS SEEN THROUGH STEEL
MESH SCREEN -- as the sun rises above the treetops.

REVERSE SHOT - BROMDEN

looking out of the window. His face washed by the sunlight.
His eyes have a vague look, almost vacuous, as...

			BIG NURSE (V.O.)
		(through loudspeaker)
	Good morning, boys. Rise and shine.
	Rise and shine.

INT. MEN'S DORM - DAY

as Washington, Warren and Miller roust the patients out of
bed.

			BIG NURSE (V.O.)
		(through loudspeaker)
	Time to got up! Come on now, it's a
	beautiful day! Let's not straggle!
	Everybody up, up, up!

McMurphy is in bed, not ready for the world, when Washington
crosses to Bromden, who is looking out the window, and leads
him off.

			WASHINGTON
	Le's go, Chief. Le's go get
	ourselves all nice and clean...
		(to McMurphy)
	You too, Mistah Mack-Murphy!

Washington goes off with Bromden.

CAMERA HOLDS on McMurphy as he slowly pulls it together and
sits on the edge of the bed. He's naked as he opens the
drawer to his nightstand and fishes around for a cigarette.

			MCMURPHY
		(looking in the drawer)
	What the...
		(looking around)
	Who the fuck stole my cigarettes!

INT. DAY ROOM - DAY

as the Acutes straggle past Big Nurse.

			BIG NURSE
	Good morning, Mister Sefelt, are
	your teeth any better?... Good
	morning, Mister Fredrickson... Good
	morning, Mister Harding;
	my, my, you've been biting your
	fingernails again...

She sees McMurphy approaching, wearing a towel around his
waist and a scowl on his face.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Mister McMurphy, patients are not
	permitted to run around in towels.

			MCMURPHY
	I wanna report a robbery!

			BIG NURSE
	On this ward?

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah, some creep stole my
	cigarettes!

			BIG NURSE 
	Oh, I had them removed.

			MCMURPHY
	What for?

			BIG NURSE 
	Patients are rationed to one pack
	of cigarettes a day.

Bromden comes drifting by, going in the opposite direction.
Big Nurse takes his hand.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
		(calling out)
	Mister Washington!

Washington comes running.

			WASHINGTON
	Yes, Miss Ratched?

			BIG NURSE
	Please see to Mister Bromden.

			WASHINGTON
		(taking Bromden by the
		hand)
	Yes, Miss Ratched...

Washington leads Bromden off. Big Nurse turns to Cheswick and
several other Acutes, who have crowded around.

			BIG NURSE
	Now you boys hurry along and wash
	up for breakfast...
		(to McMurphy)
	You too, Mister McMurphy.

			MCMURPHY
	Well, say. How 'bout springing a
	pack of cigarettes loose?

			BIG NURSE
	After breakfast, Mister McMurphy,
	after breakfast.

			MCMURPHY
	You sure run a tight-assed ship
	'round here, don't ya!

			BIG NURSE
	Yes. Now run along like a good boy
	and see that you wash up properly.

WIDER ANGLE

A beat, as the Acutes wait for McMurphy's next move, then:

			MCMURPHY
	'Kay, let's go brush our teeth,
	fellas...

McMurphy turns and crosses toward the washroom, singing at
the top of his lungs.

			MCMURPHY
	Oh, Lulu had a baby,
	His name was Sunny Jim,
	She put 'im in a piss pot,
	To teach 'im how to swim.
	Oh, he swam to the bottom,
	He swam to the top,
	Lulu got excited,
	An' pulled 'im by his...
	Cock-tail ginger-ale,
	Five cents a glass,
	An' if ya don't like it
	Ya can shove it up your...
	Ask me no more questions,
	I'll tell ya no more lies.

BIG NURSE

watching McMurphy who removes his towel as he enters the
washroom.

INT. WASHROOM - DAY

as McMurphy enters to see Warren take a firm grip on
Bromaen's head and Washington goes to work on Bromden's face.
CAMERA PUSHES INTO EXTREME CLOSEUP of Bromden's fearfully
distorted face as the BUZZING SOUND of the ELECTRIC RAZOR
INTENSIFIES until it is INSUPPORTABLE.

INT. MESS HALL - DAY

We SEE the attendants spooning food into the sucking pink
mouths of the vegetables, a shade too fast for swallowing.

			MCMURPHY (O.S.)
	What's wrong with you guys?

We SEE McMurphy seated with the Acutes, shoveling food down
his guillet. The others are barely touching their food.

			MCMURPHY
	Why, if I'd have known how soft
	this place was gonna be, I'd have
	arranged for my transfer sooner...
		(holding up his orange
		juice)
	Look at this here, real orange
	juice!
		(slugging it down)
	Hooee, that's good. Why, you
	couldn't pay me to leave this
	place!
		(slaps his belly)
	All this place lacks is a couple of
	sweet gals to liven things up...

He gets up and carries his tray to the proper place, where he
notices Miller loading several other trays onto a dumbwaiter.
Miller pushes a button and the dumbwaiter goes down. McMurphy
crosses to the door to find it blocked by Washington.

			MCMURPHY
	Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'.

			WASHINGTON
	Nobody leaves here till seven
	thirty.

McMurphy turns Washington over in his mind, then he looks up
at the clock above the door.

The time is 7:28. The second hand sweeping its way toward
7:29.

			MCMURPHY
	Don't know if I can hold it that
	long, Sam.

			WASHINGTON (CONT'D)
	Tha's your problem.

			MCMURPHY
		(confidentially)
	Who do you like in the opening
	game, Sam?

			WASHINGTON (CONT'D)
	Huh?

			MCMURPHY
		(turning away)
	Asshole.

McMurphy turns and walks away.

Washington watches him go.

			CHESWICK (V.O.)
	I wanna know about my cigarettes!

INT. DAY ROOM - DAY

A group meeting is in progress. Doctor Spivey is there.

Cheswick is on his feet.

			BIG NURSE
	Sit down, Mister Cheswick.

			CHESWTCK
		(not sitting)
	No, I ain't no kid to have my
	cigarettes keep from me like
	cookies! Ain't that right, Mack!
		(McMurphy doesn't respond)
	Mack???

			BIG NURSE
	Sit down, Mister Cheswick!

Cheswick sits -- stunned. A beat; then:

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
		(to Cheswick)
	You should have thought about that
	before you gambled all your
	cigarettes away. Is that clear?

Cheswick sulks in his seat.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Mister Cheswick, is that clear!

			CHESWICK
	Yeah...

			BIG NURSE
	Good...
		(opens her book)
	Now, as I recall, we were making
	quite a bit of headway, last time,
	with Mister Harding's problem. So,
	does anyone care to begin?

McMurphy's hand goes up. No one else's does.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Yes, Mister McMurphy.

			MCMURPHY
	Right... I've been givin' some
	serious consideration to what you
	told me about the democratic
	something of this therapeutic
	community of ours, an' I got a few
	things I wanna get off my chest,
	before we get back to Harding's
	problem.

			BIG NURSE
	Certainly, Mister McMurphy.

			MCMURPHY
	Right!

McMurphy takes a folded sheet of paper out of his pocket,
unfolds it, studies it and begins.

			MCMURPHY
	'Kay... Item one... I've been
	thinkin' 'bout the age problem we
	got on this ward. You know, the
	young an' old livin' together, an'
	I was thinkin' what a great thing
	it would be if the music was turned
	up louder. Louder so the old fellas
	could hear better...

Doctor Spivey nods with approval.

Big Nurse doesn't.

The Acutes are bewildered.

			MCMURPHY
	But then I got to thinkin', the
	music is so loud already, it makes
	it difficult for the young fellas
	to hold a decent conversation...

Nods and murmurs of approval from the Acutes.

Big Nurse can only wait for McMurphy's next move.

			MCMURPHY
	Well, I was turnin' this dilemma
	over in my head, when I happened to
	hit on that old tub room out there,
	an' I said to myself, McMurphy, I
	said, that place would make a great
	second day room. A sort of game
	room for the young fellas. Whadaya
	think, Doc?

			SPIVEY
	It is worth considering... Miss
	Ratched?

			BIG NURSE
	The point is well taken, Doctor,
	but do we have the necessary
	personnel to cover a second day
	room?

			SPIVEY
	Well, since it will be largely the
	Chronics who remain here, one aide
	and one nurse should easily be able
	to handle any situation that might
	occur.
		(he turns to the patients)
	What do you think, men, is it
	workable?

			CHESWICK
	Right, Doc. It's workable.

Several other Acutes voice in the affirmative.

			SPIVEY
	Fine!

			BIG NURSE
	Good. Good. Yes, yes, I think we
	should give it a trial period. So!
	May we get back to Mister Harding's
	problem...
		(she sees McMurphy's hand
		up)
	Yes, Mister McMurphy?

			MCMURPHY
	I'm not finished yet.

			BIG NURSE 
	Go on...

			MCMURPHY
		(looking at his list)
	'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and
	listen carefully to me, you ding-a
	lings. Tomorrow is the opening game
	of the World Series an' what I want
	is to take a vote on switchin' the
	group meetin' to later on in the
	day, so we can watch the ballgame.

			BIG NURSE
	Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah?

			BIG NURSE 
	Please understand, the schedule has
	been set up for a delicately
	balanced reason that would be
	thrown into turmoil by a switch of
	routines.

			MCMURPHY
	The hell with the schedule, you can
	get back to the schedule next week
	when the series is over. What I
	want is a vote on it right now!

			CHESWICK
	I second the motion!

			MCMURPHY
	Atta boy, Cheswick!

			BIG NURSE
	Very well! All those in favor,
	please raise your hands.

Big Nurse casts a watchful eye over the patients.

			MCMURPHY
		(raising his hand)
	Okay, raise your hands.

Only Cheswick's goes up.

			MCMURPHY
	Come on', what is this crap? Who
	wants to watch the World Series?

Martini and Scanlon's hands go up.

Several Acutes look at them.

Scanlon and Martini's hands go down.

McMurphy can't believe his eyes.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
		(politely)
	I count only two, including you,
	Mister McMurphy. Certainly not
	enough to change ward policy.

McMurphy's hand goes down.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Yes. Now was there anything else
	you wanted to discuss, Mister
	McMurphy?

			MCMURPHY
	No way.

			CHESWICK
	No way.

McMurphy starts tearing his sheet of paper up into a thousand
pieces.

			BIG NURSE
		(checking her watch)
	Then I suggest we turn our
	attention back to Mister Harding's
	problem. Would anybody care to
	begin?

She looks around.

McMurphy is slouched in his chair.

Harding puts his hands up. No one else does.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Yes, Mister Harding?

			HARDING
	Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since
	our last meeting I have been
	reflecting, quite seriously, on the
	nature of my problem. Naturally,
	I'm referring to the capacity to
	obtain the necessary results in
	order to obtain... No, no. To
	personify the very existence of
	that relationship regardless of the
	function...
		(he stops, chews his lip,
		then continues)
	Regardless of the function, we will
	confront the question of... Yes.
	Yes. The question of...
	Existence... Relationship...
	Function... Confront... Yes,
	confronting us in the moment of
	deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis
	of our souls. Of our souls, which I
	am trying to fully understand the
	problem... the problem. Not to shut
	ourselves off, but somehow...
	Somehow to understand fully our
	capacity... to obtain... to
	personify... the question...
	existence depends... depends on the
	question... to reflect... to
	reflect...

Harding, breaks off, sweating; he begins to knead his
forehead and chew his nails.

			HARDING (CONT'D)
	To reflect...

ANGLE

Silence as the CAMERA REFLECTS: the room, the patients, the
staff, the hallways, the hospital, the grounds, the trees,
the sky, ending on.

			MARTINI (V.O.)
	Hold it a minute. What's a man need
	to buy thum hotels?

INT. TUB ROOM - NIGHT

Bromden is pressed against the wall, watching McMurphy,
Martini, Scanlon and Cheswick play a game of monopoly. The
others are playing cards or just hanging around, a little
chagrined. Billy is most disturbed by this separation.

			MCMURPHY
	You need four houses on every lot
	of the same color, Martini. Now
	let's go, for Christsakes.

			MARTINI
	Hold it a minute.

There's a flurry of money from Martini, red, green and yellow
bills blowing in every direction.

			CHESWICK
	Let's go, for Christsakes...

			MCMURPHY
	It's your dirty roll, Cheswick.

Cheswick rolls the dice.

			MCMURPHY
	Snake eyes! Hoooeee, that puts you
	on my Marvin Gardens, which means
	you owe me three hundred and fifty
	dollars.

Cheswick starts counting out the money.

			MARTINI
	What's thum other things? Hold it a
	minute. What's thum other things
	all over the board?

			CHESWICK
		(to Martini)
	How can a man concentrate with you
	sitting there hallucinating a mile
	a minute...

			MCMURPHY
	You just come on with that three
	fifty and Martini will take care of
	himself... Your dice, Scanlon.

			SCANLON
	Gimme those dice. I'll blow this
	board to pieces. Here we go... 
		(throws the dice)
	Lebenty leben, count me over
	eleven, Martini...

Martini picks up a house...

			SCANLON (CONT'D)
	Not that one, you crazy bastard,
	that's my house...

Scanlon grabs Martini's hand and tries to get his piece back.
Martini won't let go.

			MCMURPHY
	Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I
	got enough troubles without you
	guys messin' around... can't depend
	on nobody.

			BILLY
		(from the next table)
	Some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here
	a long t-t-time, Randle, and will b
	b-be here long after this Wo-Wo
	World Series of yours is oh-oh-oh,
	what's the use anyway...

McMurphy slams his fist down on the table, sending the
monopoly pieces flying. Martini is crestfallen.

			MCMURPHY
	What's the use! Hooee! It'd do you
	birds some good just to get a
	little exercise lifting your arms
	to vote!

			HARDING
	A baseball game isn't worth the
	risk, my friend.

			MCMURPHY
	It is to me! An' if I hafta bust
	way outta this place to see it, I
	will!

			CHESWICK
	Right!

			FREDRICKSON
	Oh, yeah?

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah!

			SEFELT
	Big man!

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah, how much you wanna bet?

			SEFELT 
	On what?

			MCMURPHY
	That me an' my buddy, Cheswick,
	we'll be downtown tomorrow watchin'
	the ballgame while you suckers are
	sittin' around this goddamn
	nursery!

			HARDING
	And how do you propose to
	accomplish that little feat, my
	friend?

			MCMURPHY
	That's between me an' myself. So
	why don't you boys just shove off.
	I got some planning to do.

McMurphy sits and resumes his game of solitaire. Martini and
Scanlon are putting the monopoly game back together again.

Bromden spots (or he thinks he spots) one of the attendants
listening at the door. He wants to warn the others, but
doesn't know how.

			SEFELT
	Maybe he'll just show Miss Ratched
	his big thing an' she'll open the
	door for him.

Sefelt and Frederickson smile at each other.

Bromden slides along the wall toward the door.

			MCMURPHY
	Maybe I'll just use that thick
	skull of yours as a batterin' ram,
	Sefelt.

			SEFELT (CONT'D)
	Why, my head would just squash like
	an eggplant, McMurphy.

Fredrickson and Sefelt snicker in their hands.

			MCMURPHY
	You think it's funny, huh?

			TABER
	Yeah, you don't know how to get
	outta this place!

Bromden reaches the door and looks out. No one is there.

			MCMURPHY
	Put your money where your mouth is,
	Taber.

			TABER (CONT'D)
	Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony,
	McMurphy!

Bromden turns back to the room to see McMurphy slam his fist
down on the table; the monopoly game goes flying.

			MCMURPHY
		(rising and turning on the
		others, who back off)
	You want me to show ya! You want me
	to show ya how!

			TABER (CONT'D)
	Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!

			MCMURPHY
	All right!

He looks wildly around the room, spots the machine, crosses
to it and smacks it with his hand.

			MCMURPHY
	With this thing! I'm gonna put this
	thing right through the window,
	that's how!

			HARDING
	You mean you're going to try to
	pick that thing up and shove it
	through the window?

			MCMURPHY
	You're fuckin' A-right, I am!

			HARDING (CONT'D)
	With your own two hands?

			MCMURPHY
	You heard me the first time!

			TABER
	I'll bet a buck you don't do it!

			MCMURPHY
	You're on!

			BILLY
	M-M-Mack, y-y-y-you c-c-can't l-l
	lift that thing!

			MCMURPHY
	Stand aside, son. Any more takers?

			SEFELT
	I'll bet a dollar.

			FREDRICKSON
	Me, too...

			MCMURPHY
	Right!

			MARTINI
	A nickel.

			SCANLON
	A dime.

			MCMURPHY
	Okay. Who else?

			HARDING
	Twenty-five dollars.

			MCMURPHY
		(knows he's taking a bad
		bet)
	Okay, Harding, you're on.

			HARDING 
	Okay, sucker.

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you
	guys! You're usin' up my oxygen!

The Acutes stand aside and McMurphy steps up to the machine.

He shifts his feet to get a good stance, wipes his hands on
his thighs, leans down and gets hold of the levers on each
side, and strains.

Bromden watches, in awe of McMurphy.

McMurphy turns loose, straightens up and shifts his feet for
a better position.

			HARDING
	Giving up?

			MCMURPHY
	Just warmin' up.

He grabs the levers again. His whole body shakes with the
strain. For just a second we HEAR the cement GRIND. Then his
breath explodes and he falls back limp against the wall.
There's blood on his hands. No sound but his rasping breath.
He opens his eyes and looks around. Then pulls out a
pocketful of IOU's and tries to sort them out, but his hands
are frozen into red claws. He throws the whole bundle on the
floor and walks out. At the door, he turns back.

			MCMURPHY
	But I tried. Goddammit, I sure as
	hell did that much. Didn't I?

McMurphy exits.

SHOT OF BROMDEN

looking at the machine. A long beat.

INT. MEN'S DORM - NIGHT

The patients are getting ready for bed when Billy approaches
McMurpby, who is in bed.

			BILLY
	M-M-Mack...

McMurphy turns away from Billy, who crosses to the other side
of the bed.

			BILLY (CONT'D)
	M-M-Mack, I-I-I'm sorry!

			HARDING
	Leave him alone, he's pouting.

			BILLY
	Y-Y-Y-You leave him alone!

			MCMURPHY
	That's okay, kid...

			BILLY 
	Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m
	mad?

			MCMURPHY
	No, kid, it was my own stupidity,
	that's what pissed me off.

			BILLY 
	O-o-o-oh...

			MCMURPHY
	What we're gonna have to do is pull
	this ballclub together for our next
	play. 'Kay!

			BILLY
	'K-k-kay, Mack!

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Washington, Warren and Miller are at the end of the hallway,
listening to a small RADIO. We can HEAR the SPORTS ANNOUNCER
giving the line-up for the opening game of the World Series.

			WASHINGTON'S POV
	Way down the hall, the Group
	Meeting is SEEN in progress.

INT. DAY ROOM - DAY

A Group Meeting is in progress and Big Nurse is honed in on
Billy.

			BIG NURSE
	Try, Billy, try...

Billy tries, but can't talk.

The other Acutes are bored, restive, waiting.

McMurphy has ants in his pants as Big Nurse speaks to Billy.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Was it your idea to visit her on
	Sunday?

			BILLY
	Y-y-y-yes...

			BIG NURSE
	Tell us about it...

			BILLY
	I-I-I-I c-c-c-came over S-S-S
	Sunday m-m-m-morning after ch-ch-ch
	church and br-br-brought her s-s
	some flowers, and I s-s-said, I
	said, 'C-C-C-Celia, will you muh
	muh-muh-muh-muh...' till the girl
	broke out l-l-laughing.

Billy laughs at himself.

			BIG NURSE
	What was it about her that
	disturbed you so, Billy?

			BILLY
		(rubbing scars on his
		wrist)
	I was in luh-love with her.

			BIG NURSE
	Billy, were you afraid of her, or
	of her love?

No response from Billy.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	That was the first time you
	attempted to commit suicide, wasn't
	it?
		(no response)
	You must try to talk about it,
	Billy.

			MCMURPHY
	Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want
	to talk, so get off his back an'
	let's get on to some new business.

			BIG NURSE 
	Mister McMurphy, the purpose of
	this meeting is therapy. Group
	therapy.

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah, yeah, the hell with that
	crap! The World Series is goin' on
	right' now an' that's therapy also!

			BIG NURSE 
	Let me pose a question to the
	group: do any of you feel that
	Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing
	his personal desires on you too
	much?

			MCMURPHY
	What the hell does that have to do
	with it? This is an important event
	and I want a vote on it!

			CHESWICK
	Yeah, let's vote on it!

			BIG NURSE
	Will one more vote satisfy you?

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah, it'll satisfy me.

			BIG NURSE 
	Very well. What is it you're
	proposing, Mister McMurphy?

			MCMURPHY
	I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin'
	the ballgame!

			BIG NURSE 
		(to the patients)
	A vote is before the group.

			MCMURPHY
	Okay, I wanna see the hands. I
	wanna see which of you birds has
	any guts.

			BIG NURSE 
	Everyone in favor of changing the
	schedule raise his hand.

The first hand to come up is Cheswick's. Then McMurphy's.
Then Martini, Scanlon, Sefelt, Fredrickson, Billy and Taber.

Harding doesn't vote.

Big Nurse starts counting the hands.

McMurphy, his face beaming, counts the hands.

			MCMURPHY
	That's it! We made it!

			BIG NURSE
	I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count
	only eight.

			MCMURPHY
	So do I!

			BIG NURSE 
	But there are eighteen patients on
	the ward, Mister McMurphy.

			MCMURPHY
		(the light dawning)
	You mean to tell me you're gonna
	count those old birds over there?

			BIG NURSE 
	I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you
	must have a majority to change ward
	policy.

			MCMURPHY
	Well, I'll be a son-of-a-bitch...

			BILLY
	B-But, M-M-Miss R-Ratched, y-you n
	never c-c-counted th-their votes
	before!

A beat.

			BIG NURSE
		(losing ground)
	You mean you don't want their votes
	to count, Billy!

			BILLY
	I-I-I...

			MCMURPHY
	Well, screw that noise!

McMurphy rises and, taking his chair, he crosses toward the
television set.

			BIG NURSE
	Sit down, Mister McMurphy!

McMurphy turns the TV on, flips the channel, then sits and
waits for a picture.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	I want you to turn the television
	off and return to your place!

A picture swirls onto the TV screen. The ballgame is in
progress (documentary footage to be used).

Martini rushes over and joins McMurphy. Scanlon follows hot
on his heels as --

			MCMURPHY
	Hoo-wee! Man, all I need me now is
	a can of beer and a red-hot.

Cheswick gets up and starts across when --

			BIG NURSE
	Sit down, Mister Cheswick.

Cheswick stops and stands there, helpless to move.

			CHESWICK
	Mack...

McMurphy is deep into the game.

INSERT - TV SCREEN

On the screen a great play is taking place, and at the
breathtaking moment the TV picture swirls into a little eye
of light -- then nothing.

BACK TO SCENE

The Acutes are left with their mouths hanging open.

			BIG NURSE (V.O.)
		(over loudspeaker)
	I want you men to return to your
	proper places. The group meeting is
	not over!

McMurphy continues looking at the blank TV screen as the
Acutes look from McMurphy to Big Nurse, not knowing what to
do next when --

			MCMURPHY
		(jumping up and shouting
		at the blank TV screen)
	A hit! It's a hit! He's rounding
	first, heading for second. Here
	comes the throw. He's sliding...
	and... he's safe! He's safe!
		(McMurphy whistles and
		claps his hands)
	Hoo-wee! Whatta game! Whatta game!
	Come on, Koufax! Strike 'em out!

The Acutes are stunned at McMurphy's outburst.

			BIG NURSE (V.O.)
		(over loudspeaker)
	Mister McMurphy, you are
	deliberately violating the
	rules!...

			MCMURPHY
	He's into his wind-up. Here comes
	the pitch. Strike on the inside
	corner!

Sefelt, Fredrickson, Billy and Taber get up and cross toward
the TV. Harding is the only one who doesn't join them.

			BIG NURSE (V.O.)
		(over loudspeaker)
	You men remain seated!

			MCMURPHY
		(focusing in on TV screen)
	He's into his wind-up. Here's the
	next pitch... and it's a hit! It's
	a hit!

			MARTINI
		(jumping up and down)
	I saw thum! I saw thum!

			SCANLON
	Me, too! Me, too!

			SEFELT
	Yes, I see it! I see it!

			MCMURPHY
		(on his feet, shouting)
	Ya-hoo, let's'play ball!

The other Acutes pick up on McMurphy and start shouting at
the blank TV screen.

			ACUTES
	Ya-hoo! 
	It's a hit! 
	A triple! 
	It's a home run! 
	A double! 
	He's out! 
	Whadaya blind? 
	He's safe by a mile! 
		(AD LIB)

			BIG NURSE (V.O.)
		(over loudspeaker)
	You boys, stop this and go to your
	assignments! Mister McMurphy, I
	want you to set an example...

			MCMURPHY
	'Kay, it's two outs, bases loaded
	as Koufax steps up to the mound...
	Checks the runners... goes into his
	wind-up... Here comes the three-two
	pitch... And it's a fly ball into
	deep center. Mantle is going back.
	He's going back! Back! His back is
	up against the wall... and... he
	catches it! He catches it!

The Acutes are shouting, cheering, stomping and dancing in
each other's arms.

			BIG NURSE'S VOICE
		(over loudspeaker)
	You men stop this! Mister
	Washington! Miller! Warren!

Big Nurse's last words overload the intercom and the system
peaks out. Big Nurse's mouth continues to work in frantic
circles as Washington, Miller and Warren rush to quell the
uproar.

INT. SPIVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

Doctor Spivey is seated behind his desk, looking over
McMurphy's papers.

McMurphy sits facing him.

			SPIVEY
	How are you feeling?

			MCMURPHY
	Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think
	I might've put on a couple of
	pounds since I got here.

			SPIVEY
	Good, good, and how are you getting
	along on the ward?

			MCMURPHY
	Come on, Doc, you know as well as I
	do what's been comin' down in that
	loony bin.

			SPIVEY 
	Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that
	you're a disturbing influence on
	the other patients.

			MCMURPHY
	Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm
	disturbing is that old nurse and
	her fixed ways. That's all.

			SPIVEY 
	Yes, that may be so, but in making
	a careful study of your past
	record, along with your behavior
	since you arrived here, my feeling
	is that you are not mentally ill
	and it is going to be my
	recommendation that you be returned
	to Pendleton where they are better
	equipped to handle your case.

This is the kiss of death to McMurphy.

			MCMURPHY
	Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'.

			SPIVEY
	I'm afraid not.

			MCMURPHY
	Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my
	ass in a sling, don't she!

			SPIVEY 
	No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that
	we cannot offer you the guidance
	and assistance that you would
	receive at Pendleton.

			MCMURPHY
	Guidance and assistance! That's
	insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.

			SPIVEY 
	I'm sorry, but I can't keep you
	here.

			MCMURPHY
	When?

			SPIVEY
	We'll let you know.

REACTION SHOT of McMurphy.

EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY

Washington and Warren are sitting on the grass watching
Martini, Scanlon, Harding and Billy, who are positioned on
the court waiting on McMurphy who is under the board with
Bromden.

Cheswick and the other patients hang around off court as:

			MCMURPHY
		(with great physical and
		vocal emphasis throughout
		entire scene)
	Okay, Chief. This is your spot! I
	don't want you to move from this
	spot! Never!... 'Kay, now, take the
	ball! Raise your hands, like
	this...

McMurphy raises his hands above his head. Bromden follows
suit.

			MCMURPHY
	That's good! That's a good boy,
	Chief! Now jump and put it in!

McMurphy jumps. Bromden doesn't. McMurphy does this a couple
of times. Each time Bromden remains motionless.

			HARDING
	He can't hear you!

			MCMURPHY
	I know, goddammit! You don't have
	ta tell me that!

			HARDING 
	So why are you talking to him?

			MCMURPHY
	I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin'
	to myself! It helps me think!

			HARDING 
	It doesn't help him.

			MCMURPHY
	Well, it doesn't hurt him either!
		(turning to Bromden)
	Does it, Chief!
		(no response)
	See, it doesn't hurt him.
		(to Bromden)
	Jump! An' put it in!

McMurphy jumps. Bromden doesn't move.

			HARDING
	Well, I think you're just confusing
	him...

Bromden jumps.

			MCMURPHY
	Ha! Did ya see that!
		(calling to Cheswick on
		the sidelines)
	Hey, Cheswick!

			CHESWICK
	Yeah, Mack?

			MCMURPHY
	Come here!

Cheswick runs over.

			CHESWICK
	Yeah, Mack?

			MCMURPHY
	Let me get on your shoulders.

			CHESWICK 
	Sure, Mack...

McMurphy climbs on his shoulders.

			MCMURPHY
	'Kay, wheel me around to the
	basket... 'Kay, easy, easy. Hold
	it! 'Kay, now.
		(he sees Bromden has
		walked away)
	Hey, Chief, come back!

Bromden doesn't hear.

			MCMURPHY
	Cheswick, go get 'im!

Cheswick goes after Bromden, catches him, and McMurphy
latches onto him.

			MCMURPHY
	Now, wheel me to the basket.

Cheswick, straining under the weight of McMurphy, turns
toward the basket.

INT. MEN'S DORM - NIGHT

as Bromden, chewing his gum, watches McMurphy ease his way
out of bed and silently cross down the aisle, past the sleep
patients, toward the day room.

INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT

as McMurphy crosses the day room, past the nurses' station
where Turkle is asleep.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

as McMurphy crosses down the hallway and stops at the mess
hall door. He tries the handle. The door is locked. McMurphy
looks up at the open transom, ponders it, then jumps up and
grabs the door lintel. He tries to lift himself up, but can't
make it when suddenly he is lifted up to the level of the
transom by Bromden.

McMurphy worms his way through the transom and disappears
down the other side.

CAMERA HOLDS on Bromden who waits. A long beat. There is a
strange HUMMING SOUND HEARD O.S. Another beat, then the door
opens.

McMurphy smiles at Bromden.

			MCMURPHY
		(pointing to the floor)
	Wait here, Chief.
		(more to himself as he
		starts down hall)
	Heh, heh, I'll show 'em who's
	crazy.

INT. MEN'S DORM - NIGHT

McMurphy is nudging Cheswick awake.

			MCMURPHY
	Hey, Cheswick! Wake up!

			CHESWICK
		(waking up)
	Yeah, Mack, what is it?

			MCMURPHY
	I'm leaving. Goodbye!

			CHESWICK
		(sitting up)
	Where ya goin', Mac?

			MCMURPHY
	Shhh...

McMurphy turns and crosses to Billy.

			MCMURPHY
		(waking Billy)
	Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and
	say goodbye to your ol' buddy.

			BILLY
		(waking up)
	W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?

			MCMURPHY
	So long, kid.

			BILLY
	Wh-wh-wh-wh...

			MCMURPHY
	Shhh...

McMurphy turns from the bewildered Billy and crosses to
Martini.

			MCMURPHY
		(nudging Martini awake)
	Psst! Hey, Martini, wake up!

			MARTINI
		(waking up)
	Yeah, Mac?

			MCMURPHY
	Bye-bye.

McMurphy turns to Scanlon.

			MCMURPHY
	Scanlon! Hey, Scanlon, wake up!

			SCANLON
		(waking up)
	Yeah, what's up?

			MCMURPHY
	Shhhh. See ya around the ball park.

McMurphy crosses to Fredrickson and wakes him.

			FREDRICKSON
		(waking up)
	What? What?

			MCMURPHY
	So long, Freddy. Don't take any
	wooden nickles.

			FREDRICKSON
		(sitting up)
	What?

			MCMURPHY
	Shhh...

The other patients are sitting up, some of them getting out
of bed as McMurphy turns to Sefelt who is snoring. McMurphy
pinches his nose and Sefelt wakes up.

			MCMURPHY
	Bye-bye, pussy cat.

McMurphy crosses to Taber.

			MCMURPHY
		(waking Taber)
	Up an' at 'em, Taber.

			TABER
		(waking up)
	What's going on?

			MCMURPHY
	Shhhh. Time to say goodbye.

McMurphy turns and crosses to Harding.

			MCMURPHY
	Hey, Hard-on. Wake up, Dumbo.

Harding opens his eyes and looks at McMurphy.

			MCMURPHY (CONT'D)
	Ya owe me twenty-five bucks.

			HARDING
	What for?

			MCMURPHY
	I'm busting outta this place.

			HARDING 
	That's nice. Send me a post card.

Harding turns his back to McMurphy.

			MCMURPHY
		(turning to the others who
		have gathered around)
	So long suckers.

			BILLY
	Wh-wh-where ya going, M-M-Mac?

			CHESWICK
	How ya gettin' out, Mac?

			MCMURPHY
	Shhh... That's for me to know an'
	you to find out.

			TABER
	Bullshit. You ain't got no way out!

			MCMURPHY
	Oh, yeah?

			TABER
	Yeah!

			MCMURPHY
	How much ya wanna bet?

			TABER (CONT'D)
	Ten bucks.

			MCMURPHY
	You're on.
		(to the others)
	Let's go! An' keep it quiet.

McMurphy starts down the aisle. The others follow.

INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT

as McMurphy and the other patients cross the day room, past
the nurses' station, where Turkle shifts in his sleep.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

as McMurphy and the patients cross down the hallway and enter
the mess hall followed by Bromden.

INT. MESS HALL - NIGHT

Cheswick, Bromden, Martini, Scanlon, Sefelt, Fredrickson,
Billy, Taber and McMurphy, stand looking at the dumbwaiter.

			BILLY
	Wh-wh-what's d-d-down th-there, M-M
	Mac?

			TABER
	Where's it go?

			MCMURPHY
	Out. It's the way out. So just keep

			TABER

			SCANLON
	Me too! Me too!

			BILLY
	Y-y-yeah, p-p-prove it, M-M-Mac!

			CHESWICK
	Yeah, show us, Mac!

			MCMURPHY
	Shhh. Wait a minute. You guys are
	gonna screw up my plans. So just
	gone on back to bed like nothin'
	happened.

			MARTINI
	No! I wanna go!

			SCANLON
	Me too! Me too!

Several of the others chime in.

			MCMURPHY
	Shhh. Hold it down! I'll take you
	guys down, but ya gotta come right
	back up! 'Kay?

			PATIENTS
		(simultaneously)
	'Kay, Mac!

			MCMURPHY
	Shhh... Remember this is a
	privilege, so I don't want none of
	you goons fuckin' up. Kay?

			PATIENTS
		(simultaneously)
	'Kay, Mac!

	Cheswick first ... then Billy...
	Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt...
	Fredrickson... Taber an' the
	Chief... 'Kay

			PATIENTS
		(simultaneously)
	'Kay!

			MCMURPHY
	Shhh!

INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT

The patients are waiting in the tunnel, which is used as an
underground connecting system to the institutional buildings,
as McMurphy gets out of the dumbwaiter.

			MCMURPHY
		(looking around)
	Where's Martini and Scanlon?

			CHESWICK
		(pointing)
	They went that way.

			MCMURPHY
	Charlie, ya can't ever let those
	goons outta ya sight! Understand!

			CHESWICK
	Right, Mack!

Far down the tunnel Martini and Scanlon are briefly SEEN as
they skitter across the tunnel.

			SEFELT
	There they are!

			MCMURPHY
	Hey, Martini! Psst! Scanlon! Ya
	dumb goons, come back here!
		(starting after them)
	Come on, let's get 'em!

McMurphy starts down the tunnel. The others don't move.

			MCMURPHY
		(calling back)
	Come on, you guys, let's stick
	together.

The Acutes follow McMurphy. They run down to the intersection
and turn the corner.

No sign of Martini or Scanlon.

Somewhere a DOOR is HEARD SLAMMING CLOSED and FOOTSTEPS are
HEARD coming their way.

			TABER
	Somebody's coming!

			MCMURPHY
	Shhh!
		(he listens then)
	This way!

McMurphy hustles the men round the corner as two aides
pushing a gurney come wheeling by.

			BILLY
	I-I-I th-th-think we sh-sh-should
	go back!

			SEFELT
	Yeah, my feet are gettin' cold.

			FREDRICKSON
	Mine, too!

			MCMURPHY
	We'll go back just as soon as we
	find those guys! 'Kay?

			ACUTES
		(simultaneously)
	'Kay, Mack!

The band takes off down tbe tunnel, calling out in loud
whispers, "Martini! Scanlon! Psst! Where are you?"

Down one tunnel and up another -- till they turn a corner and
see an open door.

They go to the door and peer out. Steps lead up to the
outside world.

			MCMURPHY
	They must be up there!

			CHESWICK
	Yeah!

			BILLY
	L-L-Let-'s go b-back!

Several Acutes express the same desire.

			MCMURPHY
	Come on, don't crap out on me now.
	We got two buddies out there!

			BILLY (CONT'D)
	I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R
	Ratched g-g-g-g...

			MCMURPHY
	Fuck Miss Ratched!

McMurphy crosses out and up the stairs.

The Acutes look at each other. A beat, then:

			MCMURPHY (O.S.)
	Wow! Look at this!

The Acutes don't move.

			MCMURPHY (O.S.)
	Hey, you guys, come on up here and
	take a gander at this!

The Acutes inch their way out the door and up the steps.

EXT. INSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS - NIGHT

as the Acutes join McMurphy to see the moon low in the sky,
silhouetting the trees and buildings, and Martini chasing

Scanlon across the wet grounds.

			CHESWICK
	There they are!

			MCMURPHY
		(his attention elsewhere)
	Hey, what's that?

			SEVERAL ACUTES
		(simultaneously)
	What? Where?

			MCMURPHY
		(pointing)
	Over there!

			SEFELT
		(squinting)
	I don't know...

			BILLY
	I-i-it's a b-b-bus!

			MCMURPHY
	A bus?

			BILLY (CONT'D)
	Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!

			MCMURPHY
	Well, shoot, man! Whadaya say we
	take ourselves a little spin around
	the place.

			TABER
	We'll get in trouble...

			CHESWICK
	Yeah, maybe we ought to go back,
	Mac...

			FREDRICKSON
	Yeah, my feet are cold...

			SEFELT
	My feet hurt...

			BILLY
	I-I-I'm w-w-wet...

			MCMURPHY
		(walking towards the bus)
	Go ahead! Go back!

The Acutes cast frightened looks at each other then go after
McMurphy. Martini and Scanlon join them.

			BILLY (CONT'D)
	H-H-How d-d-do we g-g-get b-back?

McMurphy has reached the bus and begins checking it out.

			TABER
	Yeah, take us back to the
	dumbwaiter, Mac.

			MCMURPHY
	I'm not going back in there. I told
	ya this was a one way trip. Now
	stand aside.

McMurphy lifts the hood to the bus and begins jumping the
wire. The Acutes stand helplessly by as the engine turns over
and catches. McMurphy closes the hood and gets on the bus to
a chorus of, "Please, Mac, take us back... Please..."
McMurphy puts the bus in gear and the bus starts moving. The
Acutes start running alongside of the bus calling out for
McMurphy to take them back.

			MCMURPHY
		(shouting to them)
	Get on assholes!

They leap on.

EXT. INSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT

As the bus makes a full circle and stops alongside of
Bromden.

			MCMURPHY
		(waving Bromden onto the
		bus)
	Come on, Chief! Let's go!

Bromden boards the bus. McMurphy lets out a war whoop as he
closes the door and starts the bus moving.

EXT. INSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS - NIGHT

as the bus picks up speed and churns across the grounds.

INT. BUS - NIGHT

the Acutes look out with wild-eyed excitement.

EXT. INSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS - NIGHT

as the bus careens out the main entrance and down the
thoroughfare.

INT. BUS - NIGHT

as the Acutes cast worried looks at each other.

EXT. HIGHWAY

as the bus turns a corner past a sign that reads: 

DALLES 6, SALMON CREEK 8, DEPOE BAY 11, CAPE LOOKOUT 22,
PORTLAND 46

INT. BUS - NIGHT

McMurphy is singing at the top of his lungs.

			MCMURPHY
		(singing)
	Your horses are hungry,
	That's what she did say,
	Come sit down beside me,
	An' feed them some hay.
	My horses ain't hungry,
	They wontt eat your hay-ay-aeee...

			BILLY
	H-Hey, M-Mack.

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah, kid?

			BILLY 
	W-W-Where we g-g-going?

			MCMURPHY
	I dunno. Where do ya wanna go?

			MARTINI
	I wanna go home!

			SCANLON
	Yeah, it's cold!

			MARTINI
	I'm hungry.

			TABER
	Yeah, we'll miss breakfast!

			MCMURPHY
	Breakfast! Hell, I know just the
	place where we can chow down an'
	thaw out before we shoot back on
	home. 'Kay?

			BILLY
	'K-Kay, M-Mack!

			MCMURPHY
		(singing)
	Soo, fare-the-weel, darlin'.
	I'm gone on my way,
	My wagons are loaded,
	My whip's in my hand...

					DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. DEPOE BAY - DAWN

The dawn is just cracking the horizon as the bus pulls up
behind a corroded tin sheet building. A sign reads: 

DEPOE BAY, SEAMANIS SERVICE, SPORT FISHING, BOATS FOR CHARTER

Beyond the boathouse is the dock with several fishing
trawlers and beyond that -- the open sea.

The door to the bus opens and McMurphy gets out.

			MCMURPHY
		(as he steps out of the
		bus)
	This is it!

as McMurphy walks directly to the wall, alongside the door,
lifts the edge of the siding, comes up with a key, opens the
door and enters.

A beat, then the lights go on inside the building.

SHOT OF BUS

The Acutes' faces pressed against the windows, looking out.

INT. SEAMAN'S BUILDING - DAWN

as McMurphy lifts a cold bottle of beer out of a Coca-Cola
cooler, opens it, takes a long pull on the bottle, then
crosses to the heater and turns it on.

Nearby, a sign reads: ALL EQUIPMENT CAN BE RENTED

On the walls are old photographs of people with their prize
catches. Fishing equipment, tackle and wet weather gear crowd
the room.

There is a counter which McMurphy walks behind and takes a
bag of potato chips off a wall rack, full of beer nuts,
hostess cupcakes, etc.

McMurphy eyes the keyboard to the fishing boats. Several keys
are there.

INSERT - KEYBOARD

with the names of the fishing boats: The Lark. Mary Ann.
Noel. Annabella. The Capri.

INT. BUILDING DEPOE BAY - DAWN

McMurphy studying the board as the Acutes stick their heads
in the door. They're all miserable and cold.

			MCMURPHY
	Come on in an' warm up. You can put
	some of that gear on to keep warm.
	An' there's beer an' Coke in the
	cooler an' some food over here...

They hesitate.

			MCMURPHY
	Come on, don't be shy now, you're
	among friends.

The Acutes come in, Bromden bringing up the rear.

Martini goes for the candy. Scanlon goes for the Coke. Sefelt
and Fredrickson go for the wet weather gear and boots. The
others go to the heater. Bromden stands in the middle of the
room.

			MCMURPHY
	Why don't one of you boys help ol'
	Chief there get warmed up?

Billy goes to Bromden's aid as McMurphy crosses to a window
and looks out.

McMurphy turns and looks out the window. A long beat.

			CHESWICK
	When do you think we'll be going
	back, Mack?

			MCMURPHY
		(looking out the window)
	Come here a minute, Cheswick. You,
	too, Sefelt. Hey, all you guys,
	come over here, I wanna show you
	somethin'.

The Acutes cross to the window and look out, saying, "What?
What is it? Whadaya lookin' at? I don't see a thing."

			MARTINI
	Oh, look at the pretty boat.

ACUTES' POV

Nestled against the dock is a trim fishing trawler,
beautifully framed in the bay window.

			MCMURPHY (V.O.)
	Yeah, did you ever see a boat like
	that? Why, I'll bet you could go
	all the way to Hawaii in that boat!
	Tahiti... the Philippines...
	Tibet...

CAMERA HOLDS on FULL SHOT of the boat.

BACK TO SCENE

A long beat, then we SEE the Acutes, wearing wet weather
gear, complete with boots and squall hats, each man carrying
soda pop, food, fishing equipment, etc., being led onto the
boat by McMurphy who carries a case of beer.

EXT. FISHING BOAT - DAWN

as a white gorge of smoke and water pours from the stern and
the boat pulls away from the dock, leaving a boiling foam of
water.

INT. SHIP'S BRIDGE - DAWN

The entire crew is jammed into the bridge, McMurphy behind
the wheel.

McMURPHY'S POV

as the dock and other fishing boats slip by.

EXT. HARBOR JETTY - DAWN

as the boat passes out of the harbor and heads for the open
sea.

					DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. BOAT DECK - DAY

The sun is up. The engine is dead. The ballgame is HEARD OVER
ship's RADIO. The men are scattered over the boat. Taber and
McMurphy, beer in hand, are sunning themselves, listening to
the ballgame. On the stern Martini and Scanlon are trying to
rig up a pole. Fredrickson gives them a hand. Billy has a
line out. So does Bromden and Sefelt who is seated nearby,
fishing the ocean floor when he suddenly gets a bite and
looks over the side, surprised. His line goes straight down
into the depths. His glasses fall off into the water. Sefelt
sighs and slowly begins reeling his line in.

Billy gets a strike and starts fighting the fish.

			BILLY
	H-H-Help!

			MCMURPHY
	Ease up on the star drag, keep the
	tie up, up and work hell outta that
	fella.

Martini gets a strike and loses it. Scanlon comes up and
starts to take the pole from him.

			SCANLON
	My turn.

			MARTINI
		(hanging onto the pole)
	No.

They start a tug of war. Fredrickson tries to break it up,
when he gets a strike and his line spins out.

Billy's fish breaks into the sun in a shower of silver
scales, and he gets so excited he lets the end of the pole go
down and the line snaps.

			MCMURPHY
	Up, I told you! Keep that tip up...
	up! You had you one big silver
	there.

Fredrickson lands his salmon in a spray of scales and blood.

The fish is flopping all over the deck. Billy grabs the fish
and wrestles it down.

Bromden lands a fish when --

			SEFELT (O.S.)
	Oh, my God! I see something!

Everyone rushes over to Sefelt and looks down into the water.

REVERSE SHOT

Deep down in the water a gigantic white form slowly rises out
of the depths, becoming solid, alive.

			SCANLON
	Jesus God...

			MARTINI
	What is it?

			FREDRICKSON
	We'll never get that on the boat.

The fish is now clearly SEEN.

			BILLY
		(calling)
	M-M-Mack! M-M-Mack!

McMurphy pulls himself up.

			MCMURPHY
	What is it, kid?

			BILLY 
	C-C-Come here and l-look at th
	this!

McMurphy crosses down and looks over the side.

			MCMURPHY
	He's a big flounder. Could weigh
	two, three hundred. You got to lift
	him in with a winch.

			FREDRICKSON
	Does that mean we have to cut him
	loose?

			MCMURPHY
	Like hell we will! We got the
	muscle standing right here. All we
	need is a couple gaffin' hooks and
	some rope.

			BILLY
	I-I-I'll get them.

			MARTINI
	Me, too.

			SCANLON
	Me, too.

McMurphy turns to Sefelt who is sweating under the strain.

			MCMURPHY
	Steady does it, Sefelt!

SEFELT'S POV

The massive fish is closer to the surface.

					DISSOLVE TO:

BACK TO SCENE

All the men are standing by as gaffing hooks and rope are
made ready. The fish is gaffed and slowly hauled out of the
water.

McMurphy and Bromden lean over, held by the others, grab the
big fish by its gills and, with a heave-ho, the fish is slid
in and flopped to the bottom of the boat. The men go
sprawling over the big fish. There's a lot of laughter,
handshakes and back-slapping going on when --

			VOICE
		(over bull horn)
	All right! Stand to! Stand to!

The men look up.

REVERSE SHOT - ACUTES' POV

Off the bow is a Coast Guard cutter, and on the deck stands
Doctor Spivey, Washington, Warren and several other aides
dressed in white.

INT. HALLWAY - STATE HOSPITAL - LATE AFTERNOON

as the Acutes, sunburned and covered with dried brine and
fish scales, are escorted down the hallway by Washington,
Warren and Doctor Spivey.

It's a triumphant procession as they wheel the giant flounder
with a sheet over it on a gurney, holding up their catches
for all to see.

McMurphy is lagging a bit behind as they pass the mess hall
where workmen are busy installing a security screen over the
transom, while inside the mess hall another workman is SEEN
welding a lock on the dumbwaiter.

INT. DAY ROOM

as Big Nurse steps out of the Nurses' Station.

			SPIVEY
		(to Big Nurse)
	Here they are, Miss Ratched. Safe
	and sound!

			BIG NURSE
	Good. Well, boys, did you enjoy
	yourselves?

A burst of exuberance as the inmates hold up their fish.

			FREDRICKSON
		(to Sefelt)
	Show her the one you caught, Jim.

Sefelt whips the sheet off the big fish.

			BIG NURSE
	My, my...

No one can find superlatives or gestures big enough to
describe his catching of the big fish, "brought it in
himself" AD LIB.

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah, ya should've come along with
	us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a
	little sun on your cheeks and maybe
	caught a fish or two.

			BIG NURSE
	Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to
	take these men out with you!

			MCMURPHY
		(loudly)
	Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't
	it!

			BIG NURSE
	No, it was irresponsible!

Big Nurse turns to the others, leaving McMurphy dangling.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
		(respectfully)
	That's quite a catch, Jim. Whaat
	are you going to do with it?

			MARTINI
		(crossing to McMurphy)
	Gimme a cigarette!

			SEFELT
	I thought I might donate it to the
	mess hall.

			MCMURPHY
		(reaches in his pocket; he
		has none)
	I don't have any.

AD LIBS: "They could use it." "Take a picture first."

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	That's an excellent idea. Now, why
	don't you boys place your fish on
	the gurney and we'll see to it that
	everyone enjoys a fresh fish
	dinner.

The men toss their fish on the gurney as Martini joins the
group and starts hitting the others up for a cigarette. All
he gets for his troubles are a series of "No," "Get lost," "I
don't have any."

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Thank you, boys. Now if you'll just
	go along with Mister Washington to
	the showers, supper is in half an
	hour.

The inmates start AD LIBBING and laughing, "We're not
hungry," as Martini sees Harding light up a cigarette and
crosses to him.

			MARTINI
		(to Harding)
	Gimme a cigarette!

			HARDING
	No!

			MARTINI
	Why not?

			HARDING
	I'm not running a charity ward...

Martini snaps the cigarette out of Harding's hand, and takes
off with Harding chasing him.

Martini dashes around the room, pulling chairs in Harding's
way, taking a drag on the cigarette whenever he can.

Harding corners Martini, but Martini tosses the cigarette
over Harding's head to Scanlon.

Scanlon takes off with Harding after him, absolutely livid.

Scanlon passes to Billy who passes to Martini. Everyone in
the room is getting wired.

Martini throws it away as Harding jumps him and nails him to
the floor.

			MARTINI
		(holding his hands up;
		empty)
	All gone! All gone! Don't hit!
	Don't hit!

Harding starts pounding Martini's head on the floor when
Billy and Scanlon jump Harding and start pounding him.

Fredrickson picks up the cigarette and stands there watching
the fight as he smokes the cigarette as Washington, Warren
and Miller move in and start separating the men.

McMurphy, watching the fight, sighs, then deliberately
crosses toward the Nurses' Station.

INT. NURSES' STATION - MISS PILBOW'S POV - DAY

as McMurphy reaches the Nurses' Station and puts his hand
through the plate glass window, his fist stopping inches from
Miss Pilbow's startled face. Miss Pilbow's scream is added to
the SOUND OF THE SHATTERED WINDOW.

INT. DAY ROOM - DAY

McMurphy reaches in and picks up his carton of cigarettes.

			MCMURPHY
	I'm sure sorry, ma'am. Gawd, but I
	am. That window glass was so clean
	I didn't even see it...

McMurphy turns and crosses back to the day room, opening the
carton of cigarettes as he goes.

			MCMURPHY
	You guys want cigarettes! Here's
	the goddamn cigarettes!

McMurphy starts tossing packages of cigarettes into the mass
of struggling bodies as Washington grabs McMurphy by the arm
and tries to wheel him away.

McMurphy shakes him off and throws a pack of cigarettes in
Washington's face.

Washington goes after McMurphy, grabs him, and drives him
against the wall, right next to Bromden, who watches as
McMurphy shoves Washington away, goes into a crouch and
starts circling Washington. Washington dances in and out,
chipping away at McMurphy's face until McMurphy drives his
fist square into Washington's white, starched chest, drawing
him against the wall.

McMurphy moves in for the kill.

			WASHINGTON
	Warren! Miller!

The Acutes have stopped fighting and are watching.

McMurphy tags Washington, then is grabbed from behind by
Warren, who pulls him back.

Washington moves in and goes to work on McMurphy, when
Bromden grabs Washington, from behind, in a bear hug.

Miller jumps on Bromden's back. Bromden, still holding
Washington, backs up into the wall, squashing Miller, who
screams out.

EXT. HALLWAY TO DISTURBANCE WARD - LATE AFTERNOON

as McMurphy, bruised from the fight, and Bromden, handcuffed
to a special belt, wait while an aide unlocks the first of a
double set of heavy security doors.

The first door is locked, leaving McMurphy, Bromden, and the
three aides crammed in the small space between the two doors
while another aide opens the second door and McMurphy and
Bromden step through, followed by the aides.

INT. DISTURBANCE WARD - LATE AFTERNOON

As the aide locks the door behind them, the other aides lead
Bromden and McMurphy toward a bench, where they unshackle
them.

			AIDE
		(pointing to a bench)
	Wait over there...

The three aides go down the hall, leaving McMurphy and
Bromden who sit and look at their new surroundings. There is
a man sitting next to them.

McMURPHY'S POV

The architecture is the same as the ward we left below, but
it is the atmosphere that is different. A heaviness pervades
all. Heavily sedated patients sit isolated from each other.
Others stand shifting from one foot to the other, while
others walk up and down the hallway, their locomotive powers
not unlike that of Parkinson's Disease (caused by too much
sedation).

Suddenly, one patient gets up, speaking very angrily,
shouting incoherently at no one; he crosses the hall and
enters a side room. An aide goes in after him. A long beat,
then the aide comes out with the patient and gently leads him
back to his seat, talking softly to the man.

Further down the hallway, a gurney is wheeled out of the east
room with a patient lying on it, out cold; he is wheeled
further down the hall to the men's dorms, where he is left to
sleep it off.

Two aides come out of the EST room and head in McMurphy's
direction, where one of the aides motions to the patient
sitting next to McMurpby.

			AIDE (CONT'D)
		(approaching him very
		gently)
	Come on, Joey... this isn't going
	to hurt you... good for you... make
	you feel better...

The patient clings to the bench, terrified, weeping.

The aides peel him off the bench and escort him down the hall
to the EST room.

ANOTHER ANGLE

As McMurphy watches the patient go, he takes out a package of
gum. Takes a stick for himself and gives Bromden one.
McMurphy turns back to his own thoughts.

			BROMDEN
	Thank you.

McMurphy looks up. A long beat.

			MCMURPHY
	Say it again.

			BROMDEN
	Thank you.

Another beat.

			MCMURPHY
	Say... God Bless America!

			BROMDEN
	God Bless America.

			MCMURPHY
		(slapping his thigh)
	Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch!
	Does anybody else know?

			BROMDEN 
	No.

			MCMURPHY
	Shit! This is too much!
		(his mind going a mile a
		minute)
	Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust
	outta this place an' make it all
	the way to Canada before they know
	what bit 'em.

			BROMDEN 
	Ca-na-da...

			MCMURPHY
	Ya like that, Chief, huh?

			BROMDEN
	Yeah...

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah, well, well, well. 'Bout time
	the rest of the world got a gander
	at Big Chief Bromden cuttin' down
	the boulevard, stopping just long
	enough for virgins... Oh, man, I
	tell you, I tell you, you'll have
	women trippin' you and beating you
	to the floor...

			BROMDEN
	Ca-na-da...

			MCMURPHY
	Shhh, Chief, don't talk. Never
	talk! Remember, this is just
	between you an' me. Do ya
	understand?

Bromden nods.

			NURSE ITSU (O.S.)
	Mister McMurphy.

McMurphy turns to see Nurse Itsu. The two aides are standing
behind her.

			MCMURPHY
		(recognizing a long-lost
		friend)
	Hey, how ya doin'?

			NURSE ITSU
	Fine, thank you.
		(offering pills)
	Here, please take these.

			MCMURPHY
	What are they?

			NURSE ITSU
	To help you relax... please...

McMurphy takes the pills and downs them. Bromden takes his
pills.

			NURSE ITSU (CONT'D)
	Please take off your shoes.

McMurphy takes off his shoes.

			NURSE ITSU (CONT'D)
	Please follow me.

			MCMURPHY
		(rising, thumbs up)
	You an' me, Chief.

McMurphy, flanked by the two aides, follows Nurse Itsu to the
EST room.

			MCMURPHY
		(to Itsu)
	You know, I never got your name.

			NURSE ITSU
		(stopping at the door)
	Miss Itsu.
		(indicating the room)
	In here, please.

			MCMURPHY
	You comin' in to hold my hand?

			NURSE ITSU
	No...

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah... Well, see ya around, Itsu.

Itsu smiles at McMurphy.

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah...

McMurphy gives Bromden one last wave and goes in.

Bromden watches the door close behind McMurphy.

INT. EST ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

There are four other aides in there, standing around an empty
gurney.

A DOCTOR is at the head of the gurney, a NURSE alongside of
him.

			MCMURPHY
		(as he enters)
	Hi...

McMurphy looks around at the six aides.

			MCMURPHY
	You boys can take a cigarette break
	now...

The Nurse smiles at him.

			DOCTOR
	That's all right, Mister McMurphy,
	just climb on the bed and lie
	down...

			MCMURPHY
	Whatever you say, Doc...

McMurphy climbs on the bed and lies down.

The Doctor moves around to the side of the bed and takes
McMurphy's pulse, while the Nurse dips her fingers into a jar
of salve.

			DOCTOR
		(to McMurphy)
	This won't hurt you at all...

			MCMURPHY
	Uh, uh...

The Nurse starts applying salve to McMurphy's temples.

			MCMURPHY
	What's that for?

			NURSE
	Conductant.

			MCMURPHY
		(smiling up at her)
	Surely, goodness and mercy will
	follow this, eh, honey?

			DOCTOR
		(holding a mouthpiece)
	Please, put this in your mouth...

McMurphy takes the bit in his teeth. The Doctor moves back to
the head of the gurney and places the thongs on McMurphy's
temples.

The Doctor nods to the six aides, who move in and gently
place their hands, in a very professional manner, on
McMurphy's knees, hips and shoulders. Once set, the Doctor
turns to his controls.

SHOT OF McMURPHY

as he looks around, not nearly as scared as he is mystified
by the whole process, when suddenly, without warning,
McMurphy is hit by the shock. His face is a contorted mask of
surprise and pain. His whole body caught in a sudden spasm. A
moment of rigidity, then McMurphy passes out and his body
relaxes. Another moment, then a series of violent body spasms
begin flowing down his body. Now the aides' function is very
clear, as they press down, holding McMurphy firmly to the
gurney, until the last spasm subsides.

					SLOW FADE OUT
					TO:

FADE IN:

INT. DAY ROOM - DAY

A Group Meeting is in progress. Doctor Spivey is there.

			BIG NURSE
		(to Sefelt)
	It's been brought to my attention
	that you're giving Mister
	Fredrickson your medication, aren't
	you, Mister Sefelt?

			SEFELT
	It's the Dilantin that makes my
	gums soft!

			BIG NURSE
	Now, Jim, you must be honest with
	yourself.

At the end of the hall, the door opens and McMurphy and
Bromden enter the visitors' room, accompanied by Washington
and Warren. They cross to the security gate, open it and pass
into the hallway.

Washington and Warren disappear into a room, leaving McMurphy
and Bromden, who walk slowly towards the day room.

The Group Meeting continues over as Fredrickson raises his
hand.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Yes, Mister Fredrickson?

			FREDRICKSON
	I wanna know why the dorm has to be
	locked in the daytime and on
	weekends?

			TABER
	Yeah, why can't a fellow even have
	the weekends to himself?

			CHESWICK
		(standing up)
	Yeah, whadabout our cigarettes?

			BIG NURSE
	Sit down, Mister Cheswick, and wait
	your turn!

He sits.

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	If the dorms were left open, you
	would just return to bed after
	breakfast...

			FREDRICKSON
	So what? Is it a mortal sin? I
	mean, normal people get to sleep
	late on weekends...

			BIG NURSE
	With few exceptions, time spent in
	the company of others is
	therapeutic, while every minute
	spent brooding alone only increases
	separation.

			CHESWICK
		(jumping up as he sees
		McMurphy)
	Mack!

Everyone looks at McMurphy and Bromden.

Bromden is as he always was, as McMurphy slowly drags himself
into the day room. He looks like a zombie as he takes the
room in. Then, suddenly, he slaps his thigh.
	McMURPHY
	Hey, hey, you ding-a-lings, you
	creeps, you goons...

He enters the room doing a jig. The Acutes' faces light up.

			MCMURPHY
	I got ten thousand watts and hot to
	trot. First woman takes me on is
	gonna light up like a pinball
	machine an' pay off in silver
	dollars...

McMurphy does a full circle of the room, greeting the
Chronics. But it's an effort for him. His voice is slower,
his footwork slightly out of sync.

			BILLY
	H-h-how's it g-g-going, Mack?

			MCMURPHY
	Just fine, Billy boy, just fine.
	Full of piss an' vinegar! They
	checked my plugs and cleaned my
	points...

			BIG NURSE
	Mister McMurphy.

			MCMURPHY
		(turning)
	Yes, ma'am?

			BIG NURSE
	Welcome back.

			MCMURPHY
	Thank you, ma'am.

			BIG NURSE
	I hope everything is settled.

			MCMURPHY
	Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy
	dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar
	out of an aide for two weeks! Hi
	ya, Doc!

Spivey greets McMurphy.

			BIG NURSE 
	Good. Why don't you join us?

			MCMURPHY
	Why, thank you, ma'am...
		(he gets a seat and sits
		heavily)
	Whew. Man, I tell you, that place
	up there is somethin' else!
		(pulling it together)
	Well, ya boys been practicin' up
	for the big game?
		(no response)
	I figured as much...

			BILLY
	W-W-We h-heard y-you w-were n-never
	c-c-coming back!

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah, well, let me tell ya
	somethin'... While I was up there
	gettin' in-lightened, I came up
	with one hellava plan...

A great sadness suddenly sweeps over McMurphy's face and he
breaks off.

			BILLY
	Wh-wh-what p-plan, M-Mack!

No response from McMurphy.

			HARDING
	What's your plan, Mack?

			MCMURPHY
		(coming out of it)
	Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan...
	Yeah...

McMurphy gets up and crosses to the window, where he joins
Bromden who is looking out the window.

REACTION SHOT of the others as they look at McMurphy and each
other with quizzical looks.

INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

On the court both teams are lined up taking photographs for
the local newspaper. The bulb pops a few times.

			PHOTOGRAPHER
		(wrapping it up)
	Thank you, boys.

The line breaks up. McMurphy crosses to Big Nurse, who sits
in the front row.

It's the big Saturday game between the Acutes and Aides, as
spectators enter the gymnasium already half-filled with male
and female patients, staff members and visitors.

Doctor Spivey stands nearby at the timers' table, basketball
in hand, whistle around his neck, talking to the timer.

			MCMURPHY
	Miss Ratched, would you please save
	a space for my aunt? She's comin'
	down from Portland.

			BIG NURSE
	Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with
	pleasure.

			MCMURPHY
	Thank you, ma'am...

O.S. the WHISTLE BLOWS.

			MCMURPHY
	Gotta go now, ma'am...

			BIG NURSE
	Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.

			MCMURPHY
	Thank you, ma'am.

McMurphy crosses onto the court. Big Nurse watches him go.

BASKETBALL COURT

Doctor Spivey is at half-court, basketball in hand as the
players take up their positions: Washington faces McMurphy
for the jump at center. Harding and Billy are playing guard
with Warren and Miller on them. Martini and Scanlon are in
the forward position, with the two white Aides covering them.
The other Acutes sit on the bench as substitutes.

			MCMURPHY
		(to Washington)
	Hey, Sam, bet ya two bucks ya lose.

			WASHINGTON
	Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth
	considerin'.

			MCMURPHY
	How 'bout twenty?

			WASHINGTON
	Now you talkin'.

			MCMURPHY
	Bet!

			WASHINGTON
	Bet you ass...

			MCMURPHY
		(to Spivey)
	You're a witness, Doc!

			SPIVEY
	Me? I didn't hear a thing! Let's
	play ball!

Spivey checks the court, then blows the whistle as he tosses
the ball into the air.

Washington taps the ball to Warren, who passes to Miller, who
hands off to Washington, who goes up for a layup. Two points.
The Acutes haven't even moved from their spots. The
scoreboard reads: AIDES 2 PATIENTS 0.

			MCMURPHY
		(taking the ball out)
	Come on, wake up, you ding-a-lings.
	The game is on.

The Acutes snap to and McMurphy passes the ball into Harding,
who fiercely dribbles down court, McMurphy running alongside
him.

			MCMURPHY
	Pass the ball, Harding...
		(no pass)
	Don't hang onto it...
		(no response)
	Pass it, goddammit!

Harding dribbles into the corner and finds himself bottled in
by two Aides.

			MCMURPHY
	Harding, here, over here!

The ball is snagged from Harding's hands by an Aide, who
passes it down court to another Aide, who turns and makes
another basket.

Scoreboard: AIDES 4 PATIENTS 0

			MCMURPHY
		(to Harding)
	Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!

			HARDING
	What are you talking about???
	Everybody was covered!!! Everybody
	was covered!!!

			MCMURPHY
	I was open! Come on, let's play
	ball!

McMurphy and Harding turn to see Martini, down court, passing
the ball into Billy.

			WASHINGTON
		(slapping his hands)
	Gimme tha' ball!

Billy panics and hands the ball to Washington, who turns
around and makes another basket. Score: AIDES 6 PATIENTS 0.

McMurphy and Harding run down court, McMurphy taking the ball
away from Martini, who would like to bring it in.

			MCMURPHY
		(to Washington)
	What kind of crap is that???

			WASHINGTON (CONT'D)
	Jus' playin' the game, sucker...

Washington chuckles and trots on down court.

			MCMURPHY
		(to Martini)
	Get down there where ya belong,
	Martini. You, too, Scanlon.
		(tosses ball to Harding)
	You take it out, Harding!

Harding takes the ball and passes it in to McMurphy, who
turns and dribbles down court exactly like Harding did.

			HARDING
		(running alongside
		McMurphy)
	Pass the ball!
		(no response)
	Pass it!
		(no response)
	Pass it! Pass it! I'm open,
	McMurphy, pass the ball!

McMurphy stops dead in his tracks and flings the ball at
Harding. The ball bounces off Harding's head and goes out of
bounds. The WHISTLE BLOWS. Harding spins a few times.

			MCMURPHY (O.S.)
	Harding, get back here!

Harding turns to see the other team go by. They score another
basket. Score: AIDES 8 PATIENTS 0.

Billy takes the ball and passes into McMurphy, who turns to
see CANDY enter the gym, with her friend, ROSE.

			MCMURPHY
		(calling out)
	Candy. Candy, over here.
		(to Doctor Spivey)
	Hey, Doc, time out.

			SPIVEY
		(blowing his whistle)
	Time out!

McMurphy tosses the ball to Spivey, then crosses the court to
Candy and Rose, who have had a couple of drinks on the way
down.

			CANDY
	Mack, you sonofabitch, you ol'
	fucker, how've you been?

			MCMURPHY
		(swinging her around in
		his arms)
	Terrific, baby, terrific!
		(to Rose)
	Hi ya doin', Rose?

			ROSE
	Okay, Mack!
		(looking around)
	Whoowe, Candy girl, are we in an
	insane asylum or ain't we?

			MCMURPHY
		(to Candy)
	How's your ass been holdin' up,
	honey?

Candy pokes her ass at McMurphy. He gives it a squeeze. O.S.
a WHISTLE BLOWS.

			MCMURPHY
	Come on, girls, we're holding up
	the game!

McMurphy leads the two ladies across the court.

The entire gymnasium is riveted on the three of them. As they
reach Big Nurse:

			MCMURPHY
	Miss Ratched, this is my Aunt Candy
	and her friend Rose...

Greetings are exchanged.

			MCMURPHY
	Miss Ratched was kind enough to
	save you ladies a seat...

The two ladies wedge themselves in next to Big Nurse. O.S.
the WHISTLE BLOWS.

			MCMURPHY
	Talk to ya at half time!

McMurphy turns and crosses onto the court.

			CANDY
		(calling after him)
	Sock it to 'em, kid!

			ROSE
		(taking in the players)
	Are they all crazies?

			BIG NURSE
	No.

			ROSE
	Oh, just those guys dressed in
	white?

			BIG NURSE
	No, miss, it's the other way
	around.

			ROSE
	Well, you could've fooled me.

On the court, McMurphy throws the ball to Martini.

Martini throws the ball to McMurphy.

McMurphy throws the ball back to Martini.

Martini throws the ball into the stands.

The WHISTLE BLOWS O.S.

			MCMURPHY
	Whadaya doin', there's no one
	there!

			MARTINI
	I saw 'em! I saw 'em.

			HARDING (O.S.)
		(shouting)
	Mack, get back here!

McMurphy turns to see the other team go by and score a
basket.

Billy passes the ball into MeMurphy.

			MARTINI
	Gimme the ball!

			MCMURPHY
		(holding the ball)
	Okay, Martini. That's okay. Now you
	watch me.

McMurphy dribbles the ball down the sideline. Stops.

Goes into his routine of ball tricks: faking one way, then
the other, over his head, under his legs, finally ending on a
pass behind his back which goes straight into Washington's
hands. Washington dribbles down court for an easy layup.

Score: AIDES 10 PATIENTS 0

			MCMURPHY
		(to Spivey)
	Time out!

			SPIVEY
		(blowing his whistle)
	Time out!

			MCMURPHY
		(shouting to Timer)
	Replacement coming in! Harding out!

McMurphy crosses to Bromden, takes his hand, and leads him
onto the court and under the Acutes' basket, where he
maneuvers him into the proper position. Then McMurphy raises
his hands above his head and Bromden follows suit.

			MCMURPHY
		(starting back up court)
	Time in!
		(sees Harding still on
		court)
	Hold it! Time out!
		(to Harding)
	I said Harding out!

			HARDING
	I refuse!

			MCMURPHY
	I said out!

			HARDING
		(casting a quick look at
		his wife)
	No!

			MCMURPHY
	I'm the coach!

			HARDING
	I just started!

			MCMURPHY
	You can come back later!

			HARDING
	I don't trust you!

			MCMURPHY
	(looking for another victim)
	Scanlon out!

			SCANLON
	No!

			MCMURPHY
	Martini out!

			MARTINI
	No!

McMurphy looks at Billy.

			BILLY
	I-I-I-I-I'll g-g-g-go, M-M-Mack...

			MCMURPHY
	Good boy, thank you, Billy.

Billy goes off and sits by Big Nurse. Now, the lineup on the
bench is Billy, Big Nurse, Candy and Rose.

Spivey blows the whistle.

Under the Aides' basket, Harding passes the ball into
McMurphy, who dribbles to half court, takes his mark, and
lobs the ball over the outstretched arms of the Aides right
into Bromden's waiting hands. Bromden turns and slams the
ball into the basket.

The crowd goes bananas. Score: AIDES 10 PATIENTS 2

Bromden walks in majestic dignity the full length of the
court and takes up his position under the Aides' basket,
while McMurphy and his teammates have been putting tremendous
pressure on the Aides, not allowing them to pass the ball in.

As soon as McMurphy sees that Bromden is firmly set, hands
held up, under the Aides' basket, McMurphy turns and runs
down court, followed by the other Acutes, where they take up
their defensive position.

Washington and the Aides easily bring the ball down court,
work themselves into position, and take a shot at the basket,
which Bromden swats aside.

Each Aide gets a shot at the basket, and each time Bromden
swats it aside; sending the last swat into McMurphy's waiting
hands.

McMurphy dribbles the ball up court, where he runs into heavy
pressure from Washington.

			HARDING
		(off to the side of
		McMurphy)
	McMurphy, pass the ball!

McMurphy passes the ball to Harding and cuts toward the
basket.

			MCMURPHY
		(as he cuts past Harding)
	Harding, pass the ball!

Harding ignores McMurphy, as he runs by, and throws the ball
to Bromden, who turns and slams the ball into the basket.

The crowd goes bananas.

	What's he in for?

			BIG NURSE
	Who?

			CANDY
	Mack!

			BIG NURSE
	Miss, it's a complicated case. It
	would take too long to explain.

			CANDY
	Yeah, well, he looks like hell!

CHEERS are HEARD O.S. Candy turns back to the game.

CAMERA HOLDS on Candy, Big Nurse and Billy, who is staring at
Candy.

			BIG NURSE
		(to Billy)
	Billy, it's not polite to stare!

Billy sinks back, thinks it over, then presses forward.

			BILLY
		(to Candy)
	Miss!

Candy looks at Billy.

			BILLY (CONT'D)
	Hi!

			CANDY
		(giving him a big smile)
	Hi...

Billy sinks back in his seat.

On the court, McMurphy dribbles down to half court where he
is stopped by Washington and Warren, who put the squeeze on
him. McMurphy turns and gives them his ass to contend with,
then manages to throw the ball under his legs and
Washington's legs. The ball rolls to Martini, who scoops it
up and throwing it wildly away, the ball ricochets off the
backboard and goes in for two points.

The crowd goes bananas. Score: AIDES 10 PATIENTS 6

Bromden starts striding down court when the Aides make a fast
break past him, but miss their shot.

McMurphy retrieves the ball as Bromden, not more than several
feet from his own basket, does an about-face and returns to
his basket where he turns to see McMurphy lob the ball full
court to Bromden, who catches the ball on one bounce, turns
and slams the ball in for another basket.

Score: AIDES 10 PATIENTS 8

The crowd goes bananas and Bromden turns and starts striding
down the court when he sees McMurphy at the far end of the
court yelling at him.

			MCMURPHY
		(yelling and gesturing)
	Run, Chief, run!

Bromden gets the idea and starts loping down court abreast of
Washington, who is making another fast break towards his own
basket.

Washington and Bromden go up together and Bromden swats the
ball to Scanlon.

			MCMURPHY
		(yelling and gesturing)
	Run, Chief, run!

Bromden starts running towards his own basket, Washington hot
on his heels, when the ball is passed to him and he goes up,
makes the point, but takes a bad spill, crashing head over
heels to the floor.

The crowd gasps. The WHISTLE BLOWS.

			SPIVEY
		(shouting)
	Foul!

As McMurphy charges across court and grabs Washington by his
shirt...

			MCMURPHY
		(breathing in Washington's
		face)
	Ya fuckin' coon, you're not on the
	ward now!

			WASHINGTON
		(cool as a cucumber)
	Take you han's offa me!

Spivey comes running, blowing his whistle.

			SPIVEY
	Break it up, boys!
		(to Timer)
	Point counts. One free throw!

McMurphy pushes Washington away and turns to Bromden, who is
being helped off the floor by Harding, as...

			MARTINI AND SCANLON
	Great shot, Chief! Ya okay? You're
	doin' great!

They lead Bromden to the foul line.

			MCMURPHY
		(to Washington as they
		line up at the foul line)
	We got your black ass now,
	Washington, wanna bet another
	twenty?

			WASHINGTON
	No way...

Bromden takes the ball at the foul line. Sets himself up and
lobs the ball underhand. It goes in.

The crowd goes wild.

INT. MEN'S DORM - NIGHT

The patients are asleep except for Bromden who sits on the
edge of his bed watching McMurphy, his face pressed against
the window, looking out.

			TURKLE
		(approaching)
	What you boys doin' up at this
	ungodly time o' the night?

			MCMURPHY
	Prayin', brother. Prayin'.

			TURKLE 
	Well, you boys finish it up an'
	climb back into your beds. 'Kay?

			MCMURPHY
	'Kay...

The men slide into their beds and Turkle goes off, clucking
to himself.

A beat, then McMurphy rushes back to the window and looks
out.

McMURPHY'S POV

Outside, in the dark, Candy and Rose are seen wandering
around.

REVERSE ANGLE - BROMDEN AND McMURPHY

			MCMURPHY
	There they are, Chief!

McMurphy tries to get the girl's attention and fails.

			MCMURPHY
	Where are they goin'?

McMurphy takes off, towards the day room, followed by
Bromden.

INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT

As the two of them cross into the day room heading for the
window, Turkle sticks his head out of the nurses' station.

			TURKLE
	I thought I told you boys to go to
	bed!

			MCMURPHY
		(flagging the girls)
	Our prayers have been answered,
	Turkle! Our prayers have been
	answered!

McMURPHY'S POV

as we SEE the girls coming.

REVERSE ANGLE

			TURKLE
	Oh yeah...

			MCMURPHY
	I tell ya, there's an angel of
	mercy standing out there, Turkle.

			TURKLE
	Hallelujah, brother, now get back
	in bed!

			MCMURPHY
	Come an' see.

Turkle comes out of the nurses' station, leaving the side
window open.

			TURKLE
		(crossing to McMurphy)
	That angel of mercy, he ain't a
	she, is he?

			MCMURPHY
	You's better believe it, brother!

Turkle reaches the window and sees the girls outside.

CANDY and ROSE'S POV - THE MEN looking out.

BACK TO SCENE

as Turkle turns to McMurphy.

			TURKLE 
	Ah believe ya, brother. Ah believe
	ya!

			MCMURPHY
		(taking Turkle aside;
		holds up $20 bill)
	Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty
	bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece
	of that angel cake?

			TURKLE
		(taking the $20 and
		reaching for his keys)
	Ah'm on my knees, brother, ah'm on
	my knees.

Turkle unlocks the security screen and raises the window.

McMurphy sticks his head out the window.

			CANDY AND ROSE
		(both slightly tipsy)
	Hiya, Mack.

			MCMURPHY
	Hiya, girls...

			TURKLE
	Shhh...

Candy passes a heavy bag of bottles in. Then McMurphy and
Turkle help her in. Her dress is above her thighs, her ass
visible as she swings over the windowsill and into McMurphy's
arms.

			CANDY
	Whew! Made it!

			MCMURPHY
		(embracing Candy)
	Man, you look good 'nough to eat!

			CANDY
	Yeah, well you look like hell
	warmed over...

			ROSE (O.S.)
	Hey, pssst! Whadda 'bout me?

Turkle turns to help Rose in, but she's not as easy to
handle, being a good deal heavier and twice as plastered as
Candy.

			TURKLE
	Hey, Mac! Gimme a hand, will ya!

McMurphy disengages himself from Candy and lends Turkle a
hand. Rose is finally hauled into the room.

			ROSE
		(giggling; loud)
	Whew! Hiya, boys!

			TURKLE
	Shhh... let's move it away from the
	window...

The group shifts a few feet as Turkle closes the window and
locks the screen. McMurphy turns back to Candy.

			MCMURPHY
		(arms open)
	Come here, sugar...

Candy moves into McMurphy's arms as Rose, straightening her
dress, turns to see Bromden looming. Rose SCREAMS.

			TURKLE
	What happened?

			ROSE
		(backing into Turkle)
	What's that?

			TURKLE
		(mystified)
	What?

			ROSE
		(pointing at Bromden)
	That!

			TURKLE
	Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be
	afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief
	Bromden. That's all...

			ROSE
	Is he one of the loonies?

			MCMURPHY
	He's a patient, Rose...

			ROSE 
	Oh, yeah...

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah...

			ROSE 
		(approaching Bromden
		tentatively)
	Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'?
	Like it in here?

			MCMURPHY
	He can't hear you, Rose. He's just
	a big deaf an' dumb indian...

			CANDY
	Pssst! Hey Rose! There they are!

			ROSE
		(looking around)
	What? Where?

CANDY points to the patients sleeping in the men's dorm.

			CANDY
	In there.

			ROSE
	Wow! They're so quiet.

			TURKLE
	They're sleeping, Miss. They're
	sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down
	so we don't disturb their sleep.

			ROSE
	Are they dangerous when they're
	awake?

			TURKLE
	Oh, no, Miss. Not these loonies.
	These are nice guys. Nice guys.

			CANDY
	What's that smell?

			TURKLE
	What smell?

			CANDY
	Smells weird. Smells like
	pneumonia.

			TURKLE
	Ammonia, Miss...

			ROSE
	Smells like piss. Is this real,
	Candy? Is this really real? I mean
	we are in an insane asylum, an' I
	wanna know how we got ourselves
	into this scene.

			TURKLE
	Shhh, please, Miss. Keep it down...

Rose turns to McMurphy who has opened a bottle of booze and
is taking a long pull.

			ROSE
		(to McMurphy)
	Who is he?

			MCMURPHY
		(passing the bottle to
		Turkle)
	He's in charge.

			ROSE 
	Are you a doctor?

			TURKLE
		(passing the bottle to
		Rose)
	Not exactly, Miss. Not exactly.

			ROSE
		(drinking and passing the
		bottle to Candy)
	Yeah, well, I'll tell ya somethin'.
	I'll tell ya somethin'. I had this
	boyfriend, Chuck.
		(to McMurphy)
	Ya know him, Mac. Ya remember,
	Chuck.

			MCMURPHY
	Sure, I know Chuck. I know him.

			ROSE
	Well, listen to this. He got mad at
	me one day. Boy, did he get mad at
	me. He took the light bulb, ya
	know. I thought he was going to
	cram it right up me, ya know. But
	he ate it. He ate the whole fucking
	light bulb.
		(to Turkle)
	Now, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me!
	Is he crazy?

			TURKLE
	Well, Miss... I would say... I
	would say, yes. Yes, he's crazy.

			ROSE
	I thought so.

			TURKLE
	Is he in an asylum?

			ROSE
	He's dead.

			TURKLE
	Oh, I see. He was a very sick man.
	Very sick.

			ROSE
	That's what I told his mother. And
	she said I was crazy. Her son ate
	the whole fucking light bulb and
	she said I was crazy.

			TURKLE
	I don't know anything about that,
	Miss. I would have to examine you
	first...

			ROSE
	You ol' fucker!

			TURKLE
	Well, I'm running a risk by letting
	you in, Miss. You know I'm runnin'
	a risk of gettin' my black ass
	fired. If you understand what I
	mean...

			MCMURPHY
	Sure, she understands what you
	mean. She's not dumb. Why do you
	think Rose came to visit us? Rose
	is very interested in hospitals and
	hospital facilities. Aren't you,
	Rose?

			ROSE
	What?

			TURKLE
	I'll be very glad to show you
	around, Miss...

			MCMURPHY
	Yeah, that's a good idea, Turkle.
	Why don't ya take Rose on a little
	tour of our facilities...

			ROSE
	Wait a minute...

			CANDY
	It's okay, Rose. You can go with
	him.

			ROSE
	Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind,
	I'll decide on my own date!

			CANDY
	Shit, Rose! What's there to decide?
	There's only four of us.

			ROSE
	Whaddaya talkin' about? There's at
	least twenty guys in there. Let's
	wake 'em up and get this party on
	the road.

			TURKLE
	Now, Miss. What do you want with
	twenty zombies when you got a
	twenty gun salute looking you right
	in the face.

			ROSE
	Oh, yeah...

			TURKLE
	You better believe it, you sweet
	little thing. You better believe
	it...

			ROSE
	Don't you sweet talk me you ol'
	spook, you!

			TURKLE
	Oh, I'm all through talkin'. Now,
	let's just you an' me trip on down
	that hall.

			CANDY
	Go with him, Rose. Go with him.

			ROSE
	Well, okay, but I just want to look
	at the facilities. That's all.

			TURKLE
	That's all I'm going to show you.

McMURPHY'S POV - TURKLE AND ROSE

as the two of them cross out of the day room toward the
hallway, Turkle suddenly turns and hurries back to McMurphy,
takes the bottle of booze and hurries off clucking to
himself.

BACK TO McMURPHY and CANDY.

			MCMURPHY
	'Kay, lets get under way.

McMurphy crosses to package of booze, selects another bottle,
unscrews the top and takes a long pull, then hands the bottle
to Bromden.

			MCMURPHY
	Down the ol' hatch, Chief.

Bromden takes a long pull on the bottle, gags and passes the
bottle to McMurphy who crosses to the nurses' station and
peeks around the corner.

McMURPHY

as he peeks around the corner.

McMURPHY'S POV - TURKLE AND ROSE

far down the hallway, as Turkle shows Rose one room, then
another, and then the seclusion room, into which Turkle
playfully lures Rose, who playfully resists, but finally
enters. A beat passes and they don't come out.

BACK TO McMURPHY

Satisfied, he crosses to the nurses' station, reaches in the
open side-door window, opens the door and enters.

INT. NURSES' STATION - NIGHT

as McMurphy enters the nurses' station and looks around.

INT. MEN'S DORM - NIGHT

The patients are all asleep. A very long beat, then --

			MCMURPHY (V.O.)
		(through loudspeaker; very
		low, ominous, drawn out)
	Who knows what evil lurks in the
	hearts of men...

Ominous LAUGHTER, then the lights go flashing on and off.

			MCMURPHY (V.O)
		(through loudspeaker)
	Medication time! Medication time!
	Rise and shine! Rise and shine!
	Time to say goodbye... Everybody
	up, up, up!

Some of the patients immediately pop awake as Candy comes in
and starts hustling the patients out of bed.

			CANDY
	Up and at 'em, boys.

			BILLY
		(waking up)
	H-H-Hi, Candy...

			CANDY
	Hi, Billy.

INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT

MUSIC OVER as the patients are queued up at the nurses'
station where Candy is handing out cups full of whiskey,
McMurphy backing her up, pouring the booze into the cups.
Harding takes his cup and moves back into the day room as
Ellis automatically downs the booze, gags and goes spinning
off across the hallway and is nailed to the wall.

					QUICK CUT TO:

DOWN THE HALL - TURKLE

sticks his head out the door to check the scene out. Sees
what's happening and comes rushing down the hallway, without
his shirt, and zipping up his pants.

INT. NURSES' STATION - NIGHT

as Turkle shoves his way to the intercom system and switches
off the lights and music.

			TURKLE
		(furiously pushing them
		out)
	You crazy goons... shut up an' get
	outta here... Out! Out! Out!

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Silence as the last man is driven out of the nurses' station.

Down the hallway, a light goes on in the visitors' room.

			TURKLE
	Shit, it's the soo-per-visor come
	to fire my black ass.

A KEY is HEARD hitting the lock at the end of the hallway.
Without losing a beat, Turkle reverses his movement and
starts pushing everybody back into the nurses' station.

			TURKLE (CONT'D)
		(pushing)
	Get back in there! In! In! In!

As Turkle pushes the last man into the nurses' station, he
sees Rose stick her head out of the seclusion room.

			TURKLE (CONT'D)
		(motioning and shouting)
	Stay in there! Stay in there!

Rose ducks back into the seclusion room as, simultaneously,
Turkle closes the door behind him to the nurses' station as
the door to the ward opens and the NIGHT SUPERVISOR, a middle
aged woman, enters the ward.

INT. NURSES' STATION - NIGHT

as Turkle, shushing the crowd, makes his way to the nurses'
lounge and opens the door.

			TURKLE
		(harsh whisper)
	Alla ya goons, get in here!

The patients pile into the nurses' lounge, Turkle cramming
the last one through the door and closing it. He turns and
crosses to the side door and steps out.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

as Turkle steps out of the nurses' station, closing the door
behind him.

			NIGHT SUPERVISOR
	Oh, there you are, Mister Turkle.

			TURKLE
	Evenin', ma'am.

			NIGHT SUPERVISOR
	Is everything all right?

			TURKLE
		(blocking her way to the
		day room)
	Why, sure, ma'am...

			NIGHT SUPERVISOR
	The lights were flashing on and
	off, Mister Turkle.

			TURKLE
	Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.

			NIGHT SUPERVISOR
	At this hour?

			TURKLE
	Cleanliness is a twenty-four-hour
	job, ma'am...

Harding passes by and enters the latrine.

			NIGHT SUPERVISOR
	What are these men doing up
	wandering around?

			TURKLE
		(leaning in)
	Ah guess the natives are restless,
	ma'am...

			NIGHT SUPERVISOR
		(getting a whiff of his
		breath)
	You've been drinking on the job
	again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!

			TURKLE
	Ah, no, ma'am... well, yes,
	ma'am...
		(leaning in close)
	A man get awful lonely at night, if
	ya know what Ah mean, ma'am...

Down the hall, Rose sticks her head out the door, sees what's
happening, and ducks back in as the Night Supervisor turns on
her heel and starts back down the hallway, Turkle at her
heels.

			NIGHT SUPERVISOR
	I want those men put back to bed,
	Mister Turkle!

			TURKLE
	Yes, ma'am...

			NIGHT SUPERVISOR
	And you haven't heard the last of
	this!

			TURKLE
	Yes, ma'am...

She opens the gate, slams it behind her, crosses to the main
door, opers it and exits to:

			TURKLE (CONT'D)
		(calling after her)
	Night, night.

Turkle turns and the smile leaves his face as he hurries down
the hallway.

O.S. the TOILET FLUSHES as Turkle stops at the seclusion room
and sticks his head in.

			TURKLE (CONT'D)
	Be right back, honey...

Turkle closes the door, crosses down to the nurses' station,
and enters as Harding comes out of the latrine.

INT. NURSES' STATION - NIGHT

as Turkle enters, crosses to the nurses' lounge and opens the
door to see the patients, silhouetted against the open
refrigerator light, moving around, pulling the room apart. It
smacks of Dante's Inferno as Turkle snaps on the light and
steps into the room.

INT. NURSES' LOUNGE - NIGHT

as Turkle steps into the room and sees the extent of the
plundering. The filing cabinet is open. So is the medicine
cabinet. Rolls of medical gauze are strewn around, cough
syrup and orange juice are flowing.

The patients start piling out of the room, carrying their
plunder.

Fredrickson and Sefelt are SEEN sitting on the floor, in
front of the open refrigerator, looking through their
dossiers.

			FREDRICKSON
	Christ, they even got my first
	grade report card here...

			SEFELT
	Lemme see...

Sefelt leans in, unintentionally tipping a bottle of cough
syrup in his hand which goes "glug, glug, glug..." all over
the papers.

			SEFELT (CONT'D)
	Jesus, they're terrible grades,
	Fred...

Turkle stoically takes in the shattered remains of his job,
unscrews the top to his bottle of whiskey, and takes the
biggest swig of his life as, O.S., Rose is HEARD SCREAMING.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

as Rose, naked as the day she was born, runs screaming down
the hall, Ellis loping after her, reaching out his hand.

INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT

as the others, who are laying out food, drinking booze and
stringing up hospital gauze, turn to see Rose enter the room.
She runs behind McMurphy, pressing her body to his, as he
gently takes hold of Ellis' outstretched hands.

			MCMURPHY
		(to Rose)
	Don't scream, honey...

He gently guides Ellis to the wall, with Rose still clinging
to his back.

			MCMURPHY
	Ellis ain't gonna hurt you... Ellis
	is nice... Nice Ellis... see the
	nice lady...

He pins Ellis to the wall.

			MCMURPHY
	There, see, nice lady touch
	Ellis...

Rose reaches out and touches Ellis.

The others stand agog, looking at this Holy Trinity.

					DISSOLVE TO:

INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT

A SOFT NOSTALGIC NUMBER is HEARD OVER LOUDSPEAKER as Harding,
Billy and Cheswick watch McMurphy dance with Candy,
Fredrickson with Sefelt and Rose, who is dressed, dance with
Taber.

Martini and Scanlon are busy draping hospital gauze around
the room.

Bromden sits by the window -- waiting.

					DISSOLVE TO:

INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT

Another SOFT NOSTALGIC NUMBER is HEARD OVER LOUDSPEAKER as
McMurphy, Candy, Harding, Cheswick, Taber, Sefelt and
Fredrickson watch Rose, on a table, doing a solo bump-and
grind dance, while Martini and Scanlon race around the room
in wheelchairs.

Billy sits, watching Candy and McMurphy, who sit across the
room.

Candy is tired and bored.

McMurphy is drunk and starting to fade.

			CANDY
	It's time to hit the road, Mack...

			MCMURPHY
		(snapping at her)
	Don't worry 'bout the road! We'll
	hit the road! It'll be there when
	we're ready!
		(to the room)
	Ain't that right, fellas?

He gets up and crosses to his friends.

			MCMURPHY
	I jus' want you guys to have a good
	time... Are ya havin' a good time?
	You... you... good... good... Lez
	have some fun...

He turns to see Billy, who isn't having fun.

			MCMURPHY
	Whatsa matter with ya...

Billy turns away and McMurphy crosses to him.

			MCMURPHY
	Ain'tcha havin' a good time...
		(no response)
	Whadaya want? Ya wanna drink? A
	cigarette...

Billy looks up at McMurphy, his eyes are flooded with tears.

			MCMURPHY
	Whatsamatter, kid, what's botherin'
	you...?

			BILLY
	Ah-ah-ah-are y-y-y-you g-g-g-going
	t-t-t-to muh-muh-muh-marry her?

			MCMURPHY
	Marry who?

			BILLY 
	C-C-C-C-Candy!

			MCMURPHY
	Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a
	good friend, that's all...

			BILLY
	Wu-wu-wu I-I-I-I th-th-think sh-sh
	sh-she's th-th-th-the ma-ma-ma-most
	bu-bu-bu-beautiful wu-wu-wu-woman
	in th-th-the whole world!

A long beat as McMurphy looks at Billy, then Candy, then
Billy.

			MCMURPHY
		(softly)
	Why don't ya go tell 'er...

Billy doesn't move.

			MCMURPHY
	Go on, son, now's your chance...

Billy slowly crosses toward Candy, stopping halfway to look
back at McMurphy, who gives him an affirmative gesture. He
crosses to Candy, who just looks at him.

			BILLY
	C-C-Candy, wu-wu-will y-y-you mu-mu
	marry me!

			CANDY
	Ah, Billy...

Candy rises, kisses Billy on the cheek, and dances with him.

McMurphy beams on the twosome, unscrews his whiskey bottle,
takes a long pull on the juice, and looks at Bromden.

Bromden sits by the window waiting.

					DISSOLVE TO:

INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT

as the MUSIC ENDS. A long silence, then another NUMBER begins
as McMurphy, who has nodded off, starts awake and looks
around.

McMURPHY'S POV

Bromden sits by the window waiting.

Cheswick is asleep on the table.

Martini and Scanlon are sitting in their wheelchairs filling
their cups from through the enema tube.

Harding sits, maintaining his aloofness, smoking a cigarette.

Sefelt is sitting on the floor, in a drunken stupor, while
Fredrickson dances around him.

Candy and Billy stand, locked in each other's arms, swaying
to the MUSIC.

McMURPHY

struggles to his feet, steadies himself, crosses to the
nurses' station.

INT. NURSES' LOUNGE - NIGHT

as McMurphy enters and goes to Turkle, who is dead asleep.
McMurphy lifts Turkle's keys and leaves.

INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT

as McMurphy crosses to Billy and Candy, and gently parting
them, he puts his arms around them -- as much for support as
affection.

			MCMURPHY
	Come on, you lovers, it's gettin'
	late...

They move toward the hallway.

Bromden and Harding are the only two who watch them go.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

as McMurphy passes several doors, reaches the door of his
choice, fumbles with the keys, finds the right one, and opens
the door to the seclusion room.

			MCMURPHY
		(standing aside)
	In ya go...

			BILLY
		(holding back)
	M-M-M-Mack?

			MCMURPHY
	It's okay, kid. Everything it going
	to be okay... I'll come back an'
	getcha in a while... 'Kay...

Candy and Billy, hand in hand, enter the small room, which
has a bed in it.

McMurphy closes the door, looks at the keys, and pockets
them. CAMERA TRACKS with McMurphy, who is a very weary man,
back into the day room.

INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT

MUSIC OVER LOUDSPEAKER as McMurphy crashes heavily into his
chair. He can hardly keep his eyes open as he looks around.

Harding sits nearby.

Taber is lying on a couch, his head in Rose's lap.

Cheswick is asleep on the table.

Ellis stands nailed to the wall.

Bromden sits by the window -- waiting. CAMERA HOLDS on
Bromden.

			MCMURPHY (V.O.)
	Hey, Harding, wake me in an hour.

			HARDING (V.O.)
	Sure, Mack...

CAMERA PUSHES INTO WINDOW. TIME LAPSE SHOT of the DAWN and
SUN RISING.

			WASHINGTON (V.O.)
		(very far away; getting
		closer)
	Bibbit? Where's Bill Bibbit, ya
	damn goons?

INT. DAY ROOM - EARLY MORNING

as Washington jostles McMurphy awake.

			WASHINGTON
	Come on, get over there!

McMurphy allows himself to be led to the heavy security
partition, by the men's dorm, where all the patients are
lined up.

It is morning and the day room is a mess:

A few chairs turned over. Paper cups and empty bottles.
Puddles of cough syrup, orange juice and apple juice worked
into sticky masses.

Rose sits by herself on the couch.

Bromden is the last one led to the lineup, where Big Nurse
waits.

			BIG NURSE
	Thank you, Mister Washington!
	Mister McMurphy, do you know where
	Billy is?

McMurphy shrugs "no."

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Mister Harding, have you seen
	Billy?

Harding shrugs "no."

			BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
	Mister Sefelt...

Big Nurse's question is cut off as all the patients and
attendants turn their heads toward the hallway and start
laughing. Big Nurse turns to see Turkle, without his shirt
on, walk into the seclusion room and close the door behind
him.

Big Nurse turns and starts down the hallway, the laughter
trailing after her when, suddenly, the laughter breaks off as
Big Nurse stops and in the silence, she opens the door.

INT. SECLUSION ROOM - EARLY MORNING

as Big Nurse opens the door to see Candy snuggled up to
Billy, who lies there, eyes closed, a smile on his face.

			TURKLE
		(buttoning up his shirt)
	Morning, Miss Ratched...

He slides out of the room as Billy opens his eyes. A long
beat as they look at each other.

			BILLY
	M-M-M-M-M-M-

Big Nurse shakes her head and exits, closing the door behind
her.

INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

as Big Nurse heads for the day room, walking straight for
McMurphy when:

			BILLY (O.S.)
		(shouting)
	M-M-M-Miss Ratched!

Big Nurse stops and turns to see Billy, half naked, pulling
his pajama pants up as he runs, stumbling toward Big Nurse.

			BILLY (CONT'D)
		(crying out as he runs)
	P-p-p-please du-du-don't t-t-t-tell
	m-m-my muh-muh-muh-mummy!

He trips on his pajamas and falls sprawling at Big Nurse's
feet, his bare ass exposed to all.

			BILLY (CONT'D)
		(blubbering as he rises)
	P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t
	tell her, p-p-please...

			BIG NURSE
	You should have thought about that
	before you brought that woman in
	here!

			BILLY
	N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't,
	I didn't!

			BIG NURSE
	I don't want your mother to believe
	something like this but what am I
	to think?

			BILLY
	Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!

			BIG NURSE
	Billy, that girl couldn't have
	pulled you in there forcibly...

			BILLY
	Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!

			BIG NURSE
	Who? Tell me!

			BILLY
	M-M-Muh-Muh-McMurphy!

			MCMURPHY
	Ahhh, Billy...

			BILLY 
		(caught in his own
		anxiety)
	P-p-p-please duh-duh-duh-duh t-t
	tell, M-M-M-Miss R-R-Ratched, y-y
	you don't need to!

			BIG NURSE
	Get up, Billy.

			BILLY
		(screaming)
	No! No! No!

Billy pitches forward and collapses on the floor, screaming,
pounding his fists and feet against the floor.

			BILLY (CONT'D)
	N-n-n-n-duh-duh-duh-pl-pl-pl-pl-muh
	muh-muh...

			BIG NURSE
		(ignoring McMurphy)
	Mister Washington.

			MCMURPHY
		(helplessly to Billy)
	Hey, Billy, stop cryin'. You don't
	have to cry... You ain't got
	nothin' to be ashamed of. She ain't
	gonna tell you mother... stop
	crying...

			WASHINGTON
	Yes, Miss Ratched!

			BIG NURSE
		(to Washington)
	Put him in Doctor Spivey's office!

			WASHINGTON
	Yes, Miss Ratched...

Washington nods to Warren and the two of them scoop Billy off
the floor and carry him screaming to Doctor Spivey's office
as Big Nurse crosses into the nurses' station and picks up
the phone as Candy eases her way into the day room and joins
McMurphy.

A beat, then Miller starts herding the patients toward the
washroom, staying clear of McMurphy and Bromden, who don't
move.

McMurphy pulls the keys out of his pocket.

			MCMURPHY
		(to Candy)
	Let's go!

McMurphy checks the nurses' station, sees Big Nurse is busy
on the telephone.

			MCMURPHY
		(to Bromden)
	Let's go, Chief...

McMurphy crosses to the window, followed by Bromden, Candy
and Rose, where he begins fumbling with the lock.

MILLER

as he herds the patients out of the day room. He turns to see
McMurphy trying to open the screen. Miller crosses to
McMurphy.

			MILLER
	Hey, what's gone here?

McMurphy turns around and punches Miller.

INT. NURSES' STATION - MORNING

as Big Nurse, still on the phone, sees Miller go sprawling
across the floor. She grabs the intercom.

			BIG NURSE (V.O.)
		(through loudspeaker)
	Washington! Warren! To the day
	room, immediately!

INT. DAY ROOM - MORNING

McMurphy opens the screen, raises the window, and helps Candy
and Rose out as Washington and Warren converge on them.
McMurphy and Bromden wheel around.

Washington, Warren and Miller appear around the corner, take
one look, and head straight for McMurphy.

			WASHINGTON
		(stopping just short)
	'Kay, let's have the keys an'
	nobody get hurt!

Washington's words are cut off as, O.S., Nurse Pilbow
SCREAMS... a bloodcurdling scream. They turn to see Nurse
Pilbow enter the nurses' station, her uniform splattered with
blood, hysterically talking to Big Nurse (we can't hear her).

Big Nurse and Nurse Pilbow rush out of the nurses' station
and head down the hallway.

McMurphy is glued to the spot.

			CANDY
		(calling from outside)
	Come on, come on, let's go!

McMurphy hesitates, then moves across the day room toward the
hallway.

INT. DOCTOR SPIVEY'S OFFICE - MORNING

CAMERA SHOOTING TOWARD the door, crammed full of patients,
who stare at the scene with curious detached looks, as Big
Nurse and Nurse Pilbow force their way through the patients.
The crowd parts and Big Nurse stops in the doorway, horrified
at what she sees. CAMERA HOLDS on Big Nurse's reaction. A
beat, then McMurphy appears alongside Big Nurse and is
stricken by what he sees.

McMURPHY AND BIG NURSE'S POV - REVERSE SHOT - DOCTOR SPIVEY'S
OFFICE

The office is splattered with blood. Billy is lying face up,
hanging over Spivey's desk, dead. His throat and both wrists
are cut. A broken picture frame, containing a photograph of
Spivey's family, lies nearby.

			MCMURPHY
	Billy, oh, Billy boy...

McMurphy crosses into the room and kneels alongside Billy's
body. He gently lays his hand on Billy's face.

			BIG NURSE
	Get away from him! Don't you dare
	touch him!

McMurphy turns and leaps at Big Nurse, grabbing her throat;
he drives her into the Acutes and Nurse Pilbow.

INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

as McMurphy, Big Nurse, Nurse Pilbow and several Acutes go
down, arms and legs intertwined, kicking, trying to get away
as McMurphy strangles Big Nurse.

Nurse Pilbow screaming, as Washington, Warren, Miller rush
in, trying to break his hold on Big Nurse's throat, her face
turning blue. McMurphy's face, twisted by his passion, when
Washington lands a rabbit punch and MeMurphy's face relaxes
as he passes out.

					DISSOLVE TO:

INT. DAY ROOM - DAY

MUSIC OVER LOUDSPEAKER. The day room is as it was in the
beginning. Harding is dealing out a game of blackjack to
Martini,

Scanlon, Cheswick and Fredrickson.

Taber, pencil in band, sits pondering over a blank sheet of
paper.

Ruckly is turning a grimy photograph over in his hands.

Bancini sits wagging his head, mumbling over and over,
"Tired... awful tired..." Ellis stands against the wall, arms
outstretched.

			HARDING (V.O.)
		(over last scene, in
		McMurphy's style)
	Okay, suckers, place your bets...

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Bromden is mopping the floor near the security gate to the
visitors' room, when a key hits the lock. Bromden looks up
expectantly.

BROMDEN'S POV

as Sefelt and Miller enter the visitors' room, cross to the
security gate and pass into the hallway. Bromden goes back to
his mopping.

INT. DAY ROOM - DAY

as Sefelt jauntily enters the day room.

			BIG NURSE (V.O.)
		(through loudspeaker)
	Did everything go well, Mister
	Sefelt?

Sefelt turns to the nurses' station where, inside, Big Nurse
sits very erect, wearing a back brace that reaches up around
her neck. Sefelt shows his teeth and gums to Big Nurse.

			BIG NURSE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
		(through loudspeaker)
	That's very nice. Now, doesn't that
	make you feel better, Mister
	Sefelt?

			SEFELT
	Yes, ma'am...

			BIG NURSE
	Good...

She turns back to her work.

Sefelt crosses to the card game, where he sits and catches
Fredrickson's attention; showing him his teeth. Fredrickson
smiles at Sefelt and blows him a kiss.

			HARDING
		(who has been dealing)
	Big Ace... a lovely lady... another
	ace... an' a little trey, hey, hey,
	whadaya say... hit or sit?

			SCANLON
	Hit!

			SEFELT
		(to Fredrickson)
	Ya know what, Fred?

			FREDRICKSON
	What?

			HARDING
		(dealing a card to
		Scanlon)
	Big king, too bad...

			SEFELT
	Just wait till you hear...

			HARDING
	Hear what?

			SEFELT
	McMurphy killed two attendants and
	escaped...

			HARDING
	When?

			SEFELT
	Yesterday...

			HARDING
	Who told you that?

			SEFELT
	Gary Blinker...

			SCANLON
	Gary Blinker's fulla shit!

			MARTINI
	He's not!

			SCANLON
	He is!

Harding slams his card down on the table, rises and crosses
to the nurses' station where he taps on the side window.

Big Nurse gets up, crosses to the window and slides it open.

			BIG NURSE
	Yes, Mister Harding?

			HARDING
	Is it true McMurphy killed two
	attendants and escaped yesterday?

			BIG NURSE
	No. Mister Harding, that is not
	true.

					DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON

Bromden is squatting, leaning against the wall near the
security gate to the visitors' room, when a KEY HITS THE
LOCK. He looks up expectantly. This time it is McMurphy. Or
what was McMurphy, for his head is bandaged, and his tongue
hangs out of his mouth as he is led across the visitors' room
by an ATTENDANT.

McMurphy shows Bromden no sign of recognition, which Bromden
pays no attention to, thinking McMurphy is putting on the
same act he did when he came back from Electro-Shock Therapy.

Bromden joyously turns and runs down the hallway to the day
room.

INT. DAY ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

as Bromden crosses into the day room, gets a seat, and sits
facing the hallway, bursting with expectation.

A long beat, then the Attendant appears with McMurphy and
taps at the side door to the nurses' station.

The Acutes break off their card game and look at McMurphy;
their faces hang open at his appearance.

Big Nurse crosses to the side door, opens it, and steps out
into the day room. To the Attendant as she takes McMurphy by
the arm:

			BIG NURSE
	Thank you...

			ATTENDANT
	Yes, ma'am...

The Attendant exits.

			BIG NURSE
		(to McMurphy)
	Now, let's find you a place to sit,
	shall we, Mister McMurphy?

Big Nurse gently guides McMurphy to a seat on the Chronics'
side of the room.

Bromden can hardly contain himself as he waits for McMurphy
to go into his act.

The Acutes have already absorbed the reality of McMurphy's
condition as they exchange looks with each other.

			FREDRICKSON
		(whispering)
	Lobotomy...

			HARDING
	Yeah...

			SCANLON
	Yeah, that Gary Blinker is fulla
	shit...

The Acutes turn back to their card game as Harding shuffles
and deals the cards out.

Bromden keeps his eyes glued to Big Nurse and McMurphy.

			BIG NURSE
		(sitting McMurphy down)
	Here now, you sit here... That's
	it...

Big Nurse pats McMurphy's face and crosses back to the
nurses' station.

McMurphy just sits there, his head lolling to one side.

Bromden waits for McMurphy to go into his routine.

McMurphy just sits there.

Bromden snaps his fingers and slaps his thigh, then waits for
McMurphy to follow suit.

McMurphy just sits there slobbering.

Bromden slaps his thigh again.

No response from McMurphy.

The MUSIC PLAYS ON.

					DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MEN'S DORM - DAYBREAK

as Bromden stands by the window looking out. A long beat,
then he turns into the room and looks around.

BROMDEN'S POV

The patients are all asleep. The new night attendant is fast
asleep in the nurses' station.

Bromden quietly takes his pillow and goes to McMurphy's bed,
where he kneels and puts his head very close to McMurphy's. A
long beat as Bromden studies McMurphy's face.

			BROMDEN
		(whispering in McMurphy's
		ear)
	When I first came here I was so
	scared of being lost I had to
	holler so they could track me... I
	figured anything was better than
	being lost...

On the last word, Bromden places his pillow over McMurphy's
face and begins to suffocate him. McMurphy starts thrashing
and Bromden lies full length on McMurphy. A long beat, then
the thrashing ends. Bromden gets off McMurphy, replaces his
pillow, and crosses down the aisle toward the day room.

INT. DAY ROOM - DAYBREAK

The night attendant continues to sleep as Bromden passes the
nurses' station, heading for the tub room.

INT. TUB ROOM - DAWN

as Bromden crosses to the heavy machine which McMurphy had
once tried to lift, sizes it up, then bends over and takes
hold and heaves. The GRINDING WEIGHT is HEARD as Bromden
exerts all his strength, slowly lifts the machine off the
floor, balances it above his shoulders, then crosses out of
the tub room.

INT. DAY ROOM - DAWN

as Bromden comes around the corner and past the sleeping
night attendant in the nurses' station.

Bromden lines himself up with the window across the room,
then starts toward it, picking up speed as he goes. Then, at
the last moment, he stops and, with an enormous effort, he
hurls the machine through the security screen and the window.
A LOUD CRASH.

In the nurses' station, the night attendant starts awake and
looks around. Too late as Bromden vaults through the window.
CAMERA HOLDS on window as Bromden runs across the grounds and
disappears into the pine trees.

INT. DAY ROOM - DAWN

as the night attendant comes out of the nurses' station and
looks confusedly around. Then he spots the shattered window.

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - EXTREME LONG SHOT - SUNRISE

Rolling hills, forests and distant mountains, bathed in
sunlight, as Bromden runs across a far-off meadow.

CREDITS OVER.

          With the support of the Media Programme of the European Union
          The SOUND of Muay Thai boxing... The Art of Eight Limbs... Thrust
          and move... Feet shuffling across the ring...

                         FADE IN:

          INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON a pair of hands from VARIOUS ANGLES...
          The SOUNDS of the fighting grow LOUDER. Punches, kicks, elbows...
          The hands tense into fists. They're strong hands. Fighter's hands.

          ZOOM OUT TO REVEAL Julian (mid-thirties) staring at his hands.

          Even though he's kept in shape, he hasn't fought for a long time.
          The SOUND of the boxing match gets LOUDER STILL as Julian continues
          staring at his hands - it's almost as if he's meditating. Suddenly
          he breaths in.

          Behind him sits a young kid dressed in Thai boxing clothes - this
          is Liang, barely sixteen. He looks nervous, occasionally glancing
          at Julian's reflection through the huge mirror that hangs on the
          far wall.

          Julian continues to stare at his hands and closes them into a
          tight fist.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. CORRIDORS - NIGHT

          The SOUNDS of the boxing match reach FEVER PITCH as we TRACK WITH
          Julian and Liang making their way towards the ring.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. THAI BOXING RING - NIGHT

          Two Young Thai Boxers beat the crap out of each other.
          The crowd is wild with excitement, people placing bets on which
          way the fight will turn.

          One of the Thai Boxers goes down and money immediately starts
          changing hands...

          The ring is cleared and Liang jumps in as Julian pushes his way
          though the crowd, nodding at people as he passes. They know him
          here.

          Again bets are placed....

          PICK OUT a face in the crowd. Billy. Julian's older brother (late
          thirties).

          Julian sits down next to Billy who's delighted to see him, throwing
          his arm around him, pulling him in close.

                          BILLY
           ... I love violence!

          Billy offers Julian a hit from his bottle of Mehkong whiskey.
          Julian refuses. He's more interested in the fight.

          BACK TO THE RING where the fight has just started. Liang is
          immediately on the ropes.

          Julian watches, concerned.

          Billy takes a phone call but he can't hear. He nods to Julian
          and takes it outside.

          BACK TO THE FIGHT where Liang pulls an amazing move. Turns the
          tables. Takes the bigger man down with a series of jabs, swings
          and backfists.

          As Julian applauds Liang's success, Billy slinks off out of the
          auditorium.

          Liang wins the fight with a knock out... The crowd go wild with
          adulation...

          Julian watches, transfixed...

          Liang is lit up by a beatific white light... As he stands triumphant
          in the middle of the ring, the crowd start to gather round him...
          Julian continues to stare at what's taking place before him...

          ... Which is almost like a religious ceremony... The audience
          bow down before Liang as he stares out into the light... A look
          of calm washing over his face... A sense of stillness and peace...
          Enlightenment through victory and violence...

          INT. CHANGING ROOMS - NIGHT

          Liang is sitting on a bench, his constantly-smiling Mother beside
          him, as Julian peels off fifty Bhat notes.
          We get the sense that Julian's proud of him, that Liang is something
          of a protege of his and that Liang is incredibly pleased to have
          gained his approval.

                          JULIAN
           Two fifty, three hundred...

          Liang takes the money. Julian pulls off two more notes. A bonus.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           You did well out there. You've got
           something, Liang. Potential, yeah?

          Liang nods.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           Don't spend it all in once place.

          Billy comes down a back ally and knocks on a door. After a moment
          the door opens.

          The Doorman recognises him and lets him enter.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. UNDERGROUND NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

          WE TRACK with Billy as he makes his way through the small
          subterranean nightclub.
          A Thai man - known as The Lizard - sits by a table with a few
          locals gambling...
          He spots Billy and follows him with his eyes as he continues to
          gamble.
          Billy moves across to a small private corner...
          ... where he meets various men and women, all smoking
          Methamphetamine. Billy joins in but an argument quickly starts
          up between him and another Thai Man.
          The music's too loud to hear what they're arguing about but it
          suddenly gets out of control... Billy starts viciously hitting
          the Thai Man and quickly the room EXPLODES in a frenzy of violence.

          INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT

          A fan does what it can to cool Julian down as he counts out money
          at his desk. Sitting opposite him, feet on the table, is Gordon,
          Julian's lieutenant and the closest thing to a friend he's got...
          Julian's phone rings. He interrupts his counting. Picks up and
          listens...

                          JULIAN

           (ON THE PHONE)
           Hold on, hold on. What did he say?
          Beat as Julian listens. He glances over at Gordon who looks up,
          concerned.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)

           (ON THE PHONE)
           No, tell him to stay there. Tell them
           both to stay there.
          Beat.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)

           (ON THE PHONE)
           I'm coming over.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

          The Lizard sits outside the nightclub, somehow managing to smoke
          a cigarette at the same time as he stems the flow of blood from
          his nose with a handkerchief.
          Julian and Gordon arrive.

                          JULIAN
           He still in there?

                          THE LIZARD
           ... No.
          Beat... Julian glances at Gordon.

                          JULIAN
           You told him I was coming...

                          THE LIZARD
           Wouldn't listen...
          Julian stares at him...

                          JULIAN
           Well maybe you didn't try hard enough.
          The Lizard takes the handkerchief away from his nose. Shows the
          bloodstain to Julian.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           When was the last time you slept?
          The Lizard smiles but stares at Julian with hatred in his eyes.

                          THE LIZARD
           Just cause I ain't slept for three days,
           don't mean I don't know right from
           wrong... and your brother has become
           a real problem...
          Again Julian stares at him - clenching his fist. The Lizard notices
          this but gazes up into Julian's face blankly.

           THE LIZARD (CONT'D)
           You're not going to cause another
           ruckus in my club now - are you?
          A long pause as Julian considers it.

                          JULIAN
           No.

                          THE LIZARD
           Good - 'cause Billy ripped me off and
           then he broke my face...
          Julian turns to Gordon.

                          GORDON
           Like I always said. One day he's going
           to meet the devil.
          Beat.

                          JULIAN
           You know where he is now?
          The Lizard stares at Julian.

                          THE LIZARD
           Bangkok has millions of people my
           friend. You and your brother, you're
           lost to my world...
          The Lizard gets up - puts out his cigarette and looks at Julian...

           THE LIZARD (CONT'D)
           So what you going to do? You wanna come
           in? Very good amphetamine in here...
          Julian looks over to Gordon. Sees he's keen.

                          JULIAN
           You go. I'm gonna look around. See if
           I can find him.

                          GORDON
           Sure--?

                          JULIAN
           Go on.
          He turns back to The Lizard.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           Which way'd he go?
          The Lizard nods his head towards the busy street. Julian turns
          and heads off... Gordon steps up to the entrance to the club.
          The Lizard sticks out an arm, blocking his way.

                          THE LIZARD
           His brother didn't pay.

                          GORDON
           So? That's his problem.

                          THE LIZARD
           Now it's your problem.

                          GORDON
           I'm with you mate. Billy's fucked--

                          THE LIZARD
           You don't pay his debt - you don't enter.
          Gordon thinks for beat. Takes out his money...

                          GORDON
           How much...?
          ...and The Lizard smiles for the first time.

          INT. MA LONG'S BROTHEL - NIGHT

          Julian is talking to Ma Long, fifties, the mother figure to a
          group of girls who stand in the background.

                          JULIAN
           You seen Billy?

                          MA LONG
           Not this evening.
          A particularly pretty prostitute catches Juilan's eye. He stares
          at her, stone faced.

                          JULIAN
           Well if he comes in, tell him I'm looking
           for him, yeah?

                          MA LONG
           He's not coming in. I tell him to stay
           away. He hurt one of my girls Julian.
           Not good...
          Julian considers. Pulls out his wad of notes again. Hands a few
          to Ma Long.

                          JULIAN
           Yeah, well... if you see him, tell him
           I'm looking for him...
          Ma Long nods as she takes the money.
          Julian is about to leave. He looks at the pretty prostitute again.
          Stares at her for a moment. Then walks out.

          EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - NIGHT

          Billy's so wasted he's bumping into people. He starts window
          shopping the various brothels that line the street: groups of
          girls smiling at him... Anything for a price...
          PICK OUT one particularly young-looking girl. Just fifteen.
          She makes eye contact with Billy... He smiles... Pulls out a roll
          of notes...

          EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - NIGHT

          Julian out in the middle of the road. Girls on the pavement, girls
          in the windows. A steady line of punters cruising past.
          He stands alone. Focussed. Watchful. An island in a sea of neon.
          It feels ominous. Like something really bad's about to happen...

          INT. TAXI - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON Chang, mid-forties, a man who looks like he's carved
          out of stone. The neon lights bleed over his face in a seemingly
          unending flow as he's driven towards his destination.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. SEEDY HOTEL - NIGHT

          Police cars are parked up outside. Chang gets out of his taxi.
          Pays the driver. Makes his way inside.

          INT. SEEDY HOTEL - NIGHT

          Chang makes his way up the stairs to a landing where a GROUP OF
          POLICEMEN are gathered. Their circle opens up as Chang approaches
          and they bow as he joins them - like he's a God. One of the group,
          Kim Han Ho, gestures towards the door of Room 610 where TWO COPS
          stand guard. Chang gives a nod and the door is opened.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. ROOM 610 - NIGHT

          Chang stands silhouetted in the doorway. Stepping into the room
          he moves into the light in CLOSE UP. His face is a mask.
          The bed is drenched in blood. The fifteen year old prostitute
          lies naked on her back. She's dead, her body having been savagely
          beaten in some sort of brutal sex game gone wrong.
          Billy is slumped in the corner in his underpants, his eyes glazed,
          staring at MTV, a bottle of Mehkong whiskey in his hand, a crack
          pipe on the floor.
          Chang stares at him, giving nothing away.

          The Hotel Owner serves tea to Chang who sits in silence with

          A young cop, Daeng, who has been watching Chang, summons up courage
          to whisper to his superior officer, Phaiban.

                          DAENG

                          (IN THAI)
           Who is that guy?
          Phaiban says nothing.

                          (IN THAI)

                          (IN THAI)
           He was...
          Before Daeng can ask another questions, two more cops lead an
          older Thai man, Choi Yan Lee (50's, overweight, dragged straight
          from his bed) down the corridor towards the crime scene.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. ROOM 611 - NIGHT

          As Choi Yan Lee is delivered to the doorway, Chang gets up and
          goes over to him.
          A moment of uncertainty in Choi Yan Lee's face. Fear. He doesn't
          know why he's been brought here. He looks for some comfort from
          Chang. Chang gives him nothing.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. ROOM 610 - NIGHT

          Chang leads Choi Yan Lee to the doorway. Slowly Choi Yan Lee realises
          what he's looking at. His daughter. Dead. Mutilated.
          Every father's worst nightmare.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Is this your daughter?
          Beat.

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           Yes.

                          (IN THAI)
           How could you?
          ... but Choi Yan Lee just stares at his daughter. Finally:

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           ... What?

                          (IN THAI)
           How could you let this happen?

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           I didn't do anything.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Well now's your chance.
          A long moment between them as Choi Yan Lee fails to understand
          what Chang is suggesting. Chang stands back.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           Do what thou will.
          Choi Yan Lee nods. Chang leaves the room, closing the door behind
          him.

          Chang sits drinking tea in silence with Lieutenant Kim. The guards
          in the corridor stare at the closed door of Room 610 from where
          we hear the cries of Billy being beaten to death.
          ANGLE ON: Daeng who's starting to look scared. Phaiban puts a
          reassuring hand on his shoulder.
          As the beating reaches its climax, with Choi Yan Lee screaming
          out Thai obscenities, we hear the sickening sound of Billy's neck
          snapping. And then a regular thud as blow after blow rain down
          on his body.

          In his hand he holds a piece of wood he has ripped from a chair.

           daughters. No sons. What else could I
           do?
          Daeng watches as Kim opens the boot and pulls something out. He
          walks towards Chang and hands it to him. Daeng sees that it's
          an axe.

           What did you expect me to do? You have
           to have pity on me. My daughter's just
           been murdered.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           This isn't about her. This is about your
           other three daughters and making sure
           you don't forget them.
          Chang nods to Kim and Phaiban who grab hold of Choi Yan Lee. Kim
          slips a plastic strap around Choi Yan Lee's arm, using it as a
          tourniquet. They wrestle him to the ground and pull his arm out.

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           I won't forget. I promise. Forgive me.
          Chang approaches with the axe. He stops for a moment. Looks down
          at him...

           CHOI YAN LEE (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           I'll change. I'll be a better man.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           I know.
          Chang slams down the axe, severing Choi Yan Lee's arm at the elbow.
          Choi Yan Lee SCREAMS in agony.

          INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          The anonymity of a hotel room. Julian opens the curtains and we
          see the sky line of Bangkok - he looks out.
          He lies back on the bed, surfing through two hundred TV channels.
          Settles on a boxing match. Starts drifting off...
          As he drifts we hear the SOUND OF SINGING. A karaoke rendition
          of 'I Hung My Head' by Johnny Cash.

                          VOICE
           I set off running
           to wake from the dream
           My brother's rifle
           went into the sheen
           I kept on running
           Into the south lands
           That's where they found me
           My head in my hands

                          CUT TO:

          INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT

          REVEAL that the voice is that of Chang and he's not half bad either:
          deeper than you'd have though, and with it comes a stage presence,
          a sort of John Wayne swagger...

                          CHANG
           The sheriff he asked me
           Why I had run
           And then it came to me
           Just what I had done
           And all for no reason
           Just one piece of lead
           I hung my head
           I hung my head.
          The policemen, still dressed in their uniforms, watch in
          respectful silence. Daeng sits with them. He too watches in awe.

          Chang opens the door as quietly as he can. He slips off his shoes
          and walks gingerly into the apartment.

          INT. CHANG'S APARTMENT / KITCHEN - MORNING

          On the kitchen table Chang sees a picture. A badly-drawn house
          with a man, a woman and a child. Across the bottom: "LOVE YOU

          DADDY FROM DAUGHTER AND WIFE XXX'
          Chang stares at it and smiles - picks it up and pins it to the
          fridge with a magnet.

          INT. CHANG'S HOUSE / KANITA'S BEDROOM - DAY

          Chang and Kanita, his eight year old daughter, are playing with
          her dolls who have captured a soft toy.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           So now that they've caught him... What
           are they going to do?
          Kanita thinks for a moment.

                          KANITA

                          (IN THAI)
           Put him in jail.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Come on. They haven't got a jail big
           enough. Look at the size of him.
          Again Kanita thinks.

                          KANITA

                          (IN THAI)
           Keep him as a pet?

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           But he blew down all their houses. Would
           you want to keep a pet that could do
           that?
          Kanita shakes her head.

                          KANITA

                          (IN THAI)
           What if they just let him go?

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           How could they be sure he wouldn't do
           it again?

                          KANITA

                          (IN THAI)
           They could ask him...? Very nicely?
          Chang picks up the soft toy. Peels off a sticker from a sheet
          and places it between its eyes. Satisfied with his work he puts
          the soft toy back in the middle of the game.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           "And so the king and the fairies that
           lived in the village said to the
           creature: this is your mark which will
           stay with you forever. If you ever try
           and blow down our village again, it will
           heat up until it boils your brains, for
           it has magical properties. Go in peace.
          Kanita nods, happy with the judgement. She picks the soft toy
          up and 'walks' it away from the village of the dolls.

          INT. CHANG'S APARTMENT / MAIN BEDROOM - DAY

          Chang walks into his bedroom where his wife Nadee is just waking
          up. He kisses her good morning.
          As he starts to undress, she starts to get dressed. They share
          a smile about this. Finally Chang lies down on the bed and closes
          his eyes. Nadee kisses him good night.

          INT. CHANG'S APARTMENT / BEDROOM - DAY

          As Chang sleeps the heavy curtains are drawn to keep out the light
          of the day - but they cannot deaden the sound of the city outside
          as it goes about its frenetic everyday business.
          The CAMERA MOVES through the apartment, briefly settling on the
          sleeping Chang, then roaming through the various rooms, PICKING
          OUT different objects...
          We see that Chang is obsessed with cowboy films and a keen collector
          - the sitting room is stuffed with movie posters, photographs
          and other bits of movie memorabilia...
          Amongst the many family photos we also PICK OUT several pictures
          of Chang when he was in the army and shots of what looks like
          a very successful career as a Thai boxer.
          At the end of the tour we're back with Chang. We ZOOM IN to a
          tight CLOSE SHOT.

          We see a hotel room door and hear a knock - Julian ENTERS FRAME
          and opens to reveal...
          ...Two Thai girls - one being Mai - standing in the hallway. Julian
          lets them enter.
          Mai embraces Julian, kissing him on the mouth as Julian closes
          the door.
          They turn to consider the other girl who is starting to undress.
          She smiles compliantly, eager to please.
          Julian turns back to Mai and kisses her again. As the kiss becomes
          more passionate, the other girl joins them and the three of them
          begin to have sex.

          EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - DAY

          Chang walks down the streets towards a school. Standing at the

          as they continue down the crowded street.

          various dolls, trying to choose which one to buy...
          Chang looks round and gazes out the window into the street where
          pedestrians stream past. Suddenly Chang has a strange VISION:
          All the women disappear. In the street there are only men.
          We cut to a CLOSE UP of Chang and then back to his VISION again:
          Now all the men have gone and he can see only women.
          Back to the CLOSE UP of Chang who continues staring out of the

                         WINDOW:
          ... where everything is back to normal. Men and women walking
          up and down the sidewalk.

          The remnants of various room service orders litter the floor along
          with the trappings of a heavy session: empty bottles of alcohol,
          drug paraphernalia, etc.
          Julian lies sleeping, entwined in the limbs of the girl...
          There is a knock on the door. Julian and the girl ignore it.
          A pause and then Julian's mobile phone starts ringing. He doesn't
          answer.
          The knocking starts up again, this time louder. Finally:

                          JULIAN
           Julian's not here mate. Fuck off...
          Beat - then we hear a voice from behind the door.

           GORDON (O.S.)
           Julian?
          Still they ignore him. Either too wasted or too tired to do anything
          else.

           GORDON (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           Julian...? I need to talk with you...
          Beat. Finally Julian answers with zero energy...

                          JULIAN
           What is it?

           GORDON (O.S.)
           It's about Billy...

                          JULIAN
           I can't deal with my brother right
           now...
          Beat.

           GORDON (O.S.)
           He's dead...
          Julian opens his eyes, confused - still out of his head on drugs.

                          JULIAN
           What?
          No answer. Finally Julian gets up and wraps a towel around his
          body and slowly opens the door.
          Gordon stands in the hallway - behind him two Thai men from Julian's
          crew.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           What happened?

                          GORDON
           They found his body in a hotel room...
          Julian doesn't know what to say... Neither does Gordon.

                          GORDON (CONT'D)
           Look, get dressed and I'll see you
           downstairs.
          Julian nods and closes the door. He stands still - glances out
          the window - seeing the sun setting and the night coming in. He
          glances at the pretty girl still sleeping on the bed.
          He goes into the bathroom where Mai is dressed and putting on
          make up.

                          MAI
           What happened?
          Julian looks at her.

                          JULIAN

          any emotion.
          He turns to Gordon who's standing behind him.

                          GORDON
           What do we do?

                          JULIAN

          He looks out across the city again then back to the phone.
          It's like he's scared.
          He picks it up quickly and dials. A moment as it rings then it's
          answered.

                          JULIAN
           Hello Mum.
          Beat.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)

          INT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL - DAY

          The CAMERA tracks as we follow a pair of high heeled shoes belonging
          to an elegant woman in her fifties, who looks like she's in her
          forties and could actually pass for late thirties. She strides
          towards reception, a Porter struggling to keep up with her. This
          is Jenna Hopkins. Head of a notorious London Crime Family. Mother
          of both Julian and Billy. Newly appointed Lady Macbeth of Bangkok.
          She hands her passport over to the Concierge.

                          JENNA
           I'd like to check in now please.
          The Concierge checks the computer.

           I'm afraid the room won't be ready until
           four o'clock.

           ... It's policy

                          JENNA

          Beat.

                          CONCIERGE
           Yes of course...
          The Concierge retreats. Jenna lights a cigarette.

                          MANAGER
           Good afternoon madam, what seems to be
           the problem?

                          JENNA
           Listen to me... I've just travelled six
           thousand miles to see the corpse of my
           first born son and I haven't slept for
           thirty hours and he says I can't go to
           my room.
          The Manager just stares at her but is clearly taken back by her
          force...

                          MANAGER
           I'm sorry madam...

                          JENNA
           How much?

                          MANAGER
           ... it simply isn't possible.
          Jenna pulls out a massive bundle of notes. Peels off a couple
          of hundred dollar bills.

                          JENNA
           ...Fuck off you cunt, just hand me the
           fucking key...
          She lays the money on the desk. The manager looks around...

                          MANAGER
           Well I might be able to arrange
           something...
          The Manager turns to the Concierge.

                          JENNA
           Don't leave the money there. Some
           cunt'll nick it. Put it in your pocket.
          The Manager hesitates.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           Put it in your pocket.

                          MANAGER
           There's really no need--

                          JENNA
           Put it in your fucking pocket.
          The Manager takes the money. Pockets it. Places the key on the
          desk.

          INT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL / ROOM 300 - DAY

          The struggling Porter opens the door and lets Jenna in. She walks
          into the suite and gives it the once over.
          Satisfactory.
          The Porter places her bags on the side and hangs up some of her
          clothes, desperate to try and get out in one piece... As soon
          as he's finished he bows and starts to shuffle out of the room.

                          JENNA
           Hey... Open this.
          Jenna points to the Duty Free bag then starts running a bath,
          beginning to undress.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           I need a drink.
          The Porter is stunned.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           Well don't just stand there...
          The Porter fumbles, taking the gin out of the Duty Free bag, spilling
          the tonic in his nervousness as he makes her cocktail.
          Jenna returns in a dressing gown, takes the drink off him and
          takes a huge slug.
          The Porter is terrified, stunned. Rooted to the spot.
          Jenna sits on the bed and stares out of the window. Just as the
          Porter thinks it's safe to try edging out of the room again, she
          starts talking to him...

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           I loved him so much you know... Billy...
          Beat. The Porter doesn't know what the fuck she's talking about.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           Everyone loves their children don't
           they? Well, not everyone, but...
          She looks over at him. The Porter smiles at her.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           Do you want to see a picture?
          The Porter nods, uncertain. Jenna gets up, goes over to her purse.
          Opens it up. A picture of Billy.
          She hands it to the Porter - who takes it and just looks at it,
          not knowing what to do...
          Jenna starts to cry. For a long time. Finally...

                          PORTER
           Madam. I have to return to my station.
          Jenna snaps out of it in an instant.

                          JENNA
           What, yeah, thanks.
          She pulls a fifty dollar bill out of her purse. She hands the
          money to the Porter who leaves as quickly as he dares.

          INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHTMARE

          The elevator doors open. Julian steps out into the empty hallway.
          Everything is normal... But everything is also not normal.
          The CAMERA tracks from behind as Julian walks - looking at the
          doors as he passes them and finally stopping in front of one:
          He knocks but there is no answer. Realizing the door isn't locked,
          he pushes it open and steps in.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHTMARE

          The room is exactly the same as the one Jenna's staying in. However,
          instead of her, Julian sees a man sitting on the bed, his back
          to him. His features are obscured...
          Julian slowly begins to walk towards him, but before he can reach
          out, the figure turns to face him...
          It's Chang. But there is blood smeared all over his face...
          Julian stares at him in horror. Slowly he looks down at his hands
          only to discover that they're dripping in blood...
          We ZOOM IN on his hands.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          Julian wakes from his nightmare - covered in sweat. He is alone.
          He sits up. Looks at his hands, still very shaken by his nightmare...
          We hear the traffic of Bangkok. Julian gets up and walks to the
          table... Light up and begins to smoke morphine... He walks to
          the window and looks out over Bangkok...
          His phone rings - Julian answers...

                          JULIAN

           (ON THE PHONE)
           Hello?

           JENNA (V.O.)
           It's me...

                          JULIAN

           Hi Mum. Where are you?

           JENNA (V.O.)
           I'm in Bangkok...

                          JULIAN

           (ON THE PHONE)
           What?
          Julian looks at his watch.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)

           (ON THE PHONE)
           ... I thought you didn't get in til
           midnight...?
          Beat.

           JENNA (V.O.)
           I needed to be by myself...

                          JULIAN

           (ON THE PHONE)
           Okay... so, what d'you want to do?

           JENNA (V.O.)
           Raise Hell...
          Julian turns his back to the window.

          INT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL / BAR

          Jenna looks immaculate. She stubs out her cigarette when she spots
          Julian making his way towards her. She gets up and they embrace.
          She holds on to him. A little too long.
          Finally she pulls away. She looks at him for a long time.

                          JENNA
           Could it be have been one of the gangs?

                          JULIAN
           Maybe. Take your pick. Billy wasn't
           popular.

                          JENNA
           What do you mean?

                          JULIAN
           You know Billy... He was eccentric.
          Jenna smiles to herself as if this brings back memories and Julian
          even smiles. Both sit in silence for a moment.

                          JENNA
           But you're going to find out who did
           it, right?

                          JULIAN
           I'll make sure it gets done.

                          JENNA
           No, it needs to be you that does it.
           We need to show them. Do you understand
           what I'm saying?

                          JULIAN
           Yeah, okay, I'll do it.

                          JENNA
           Good.
          HOLD ON Julian as we bring up the SOUND of Johnny Cash's Ring
          of Fire.

                          VOICE
           Love is a burning thing
           And it makes a firey ring
           Bound by wild desire

           Oh, but the fire went wild.
          One of the crew, the rat faced Charlie Ling, starts talking to
          the Hotel Owner who was there the night of the murder. A couple

          EXT. SLUMS - DAY

          A Tuck-tuck makes its way through the crowded streets driven by
          one of Choi Yan Lee's Three Daughter's.
          In the back sits Choi Yan Lee, his stump of an arm in a sling,
          a daughter either side of him.
          His arm's only just been bandaged up and he's clearly still in
          a lot of pain, his face going into spasm with every bump in the
          road.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. CHOI YAN LEE'S KIOSK - DAY

          Julian stands on the street corner sipping a soft drink. Waiting.
          Behind him Gordon, his phone glued to his face.
          On the other side of the road is Choi Yan Lee's Kiosk, big enough
          to double as his home, currently manned by his long suffering
          wife Kim Yan Lee. She serves a chilled coconut to a man. As he
          turns round we reveal... he's a particularly murderous looking
          member of Julian's crew - Ko Sam.
          We pick out Charlie Ling a little further down the road, who's
          looking at a tray of battery powered robots that some Street Kid's
          selling.
          They're all counting down the minutes. Biding their time. Waiting
          for Choi Yan Lee to turn up.
          Finally the sound of the Tuck-tuck approaching...
          Ko Sam drinks his coconut down in one - slurping as he hits the
          bottom. Letting the empty shell fall to the floor.
          Charlie Ling stands up. Feels the gun under his jacket.
          The Tuck-tuck pulls up and Choi Yan Lee's Daughters help him into
          the kiosk that doubles as their home.
          Julian and his men close in.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. CHOI YAN LEE'S SHACK

          As Choi Yan Lee enters his home and his daughters make a fuss
          of him, the shutters of the kiosk counter are suddenly SLAMMED

          SHUT.
          They all turn round in panic, but before they can do anything
          about it, the last of the three daughters is pushed into the kiosk,
          followed by Ko Sam, Charlie Ling, Gordon and Julian.
          Choi Yan Lee snivels in the corner, waving his bandaged arm in
          the air.

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           You can't kill me. I'm a cripple.

           KIM YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           Who are you? What do you think you're
           doing? Get out or we'll call the police.
          Ko Sam shakes his head at her. Not a good idea. Julian turns to
          Charlie Ling.

                          JULIAN
           Ask him if he's Choi Yan Lee.
          At the mention of his name the colour drains from Choi Yan Lee's
          face. His eyes lock with Julian's.

                          CHARLIE LING

                          (IN THAI)
           Is your name Choi Yan Lee?
          Choi Yan Lee nods his head.

                          JULIAN
           Ask him why he killed my brother.

                          CHARLIE LING

                          (IN THAI)
           You killed his brother. Big mistake fat
           man. Why'd you do it?
          Beat. Choi Yan Lee knows he's been caught...

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           He murdered my daughter.

                          CHARLIE LING
           He says he killed his daughter.
          Julian considers him for a moment. Slowly he pulls out a gun...
          Aims it at Choi Yan Lee's face...

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           Oh God. Please don't kill me. Please.
           I'll give you anything. Anything you
           want. My daughters. My shop. Please.
           I've paid for what I did. Look at me.
          In his desperation Choi Yan Lee suddenly lurches forward,
          brandishing his wounded arm at Julian. He pulls the bandages off,
          exposing the bloody stump.

           CHOI YAN LEE (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           I've paid for what I did. Don't you see?
          Julian turns to Charlie Ling.

                          JULIAN
           What's he saying?
          Beat.

                          CHARLIE LING
           He says... He says he's paid for what
           he's done. That he's been punished
           already.
          Choi Yan Lee nods his head enthusiastically.

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           He told me to do it. Then he took my
           hand. Look.
          Again he thrusts his stump at Julian who glances at him.

                          JULIAN
           Who did that to him?
          Choi Yan Lee looks at the various faces that surround him - then
          stares directly at Julian.

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           The Angel of Vengeance...
          Charlie Ling looks at him surprised... yet there's a sense that
          deep down he knows what he's talking about...

                          CHARLIE LING

                          (IN THAI)
           It's a lie - he doesn't exist...

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           I'm telling the truth. It was the Angel
           of Vengeance.

                          JULIAN
           What's he saying?

                          CHARLIE LING
           He's lying...

                          JULIAN
           Tell me.

                          CHARLIE LING
           It's a story old women tell their grand
           children... 'The Angel of Vengeance'
           is supposed to come down from the
           heavens and judge the living...
           restore karma to the world..
          Gordon laughs... but Julian listens with great interest...

                          JULIAN
           How does he do that?

                          CHARLIE LING
           Leads people to their destiny...
           That's the myth anyway.
          Ko Sam smiles. Julian doesn't. Finally:

                          JULIAN
           Ask him who cut his hand off.
          Charlie Ling's reluctant to question him further. Julian insists.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           Do it.

                          CHARLIE LING

                          (IN THAI)
           Who turned you into a cripple - and no
           bullshit this time.
          Choi Yan Lee continues babbling hysterically...

           CHOI YAN LEE

           (IN THAI, QUIETLY)
           I'm telling you the truth... The Angel
           of Vengeance is real... He made me do
           it... You've got to believe me... I've
           already been judged.

                          CHARLIE LING
           He says it was The Angel of Vengeance...
          Choi Yan Lee starts to giggle uncontrollably.

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           The Angel of Vengeance. Yes. You don't
           find the Angel of Vengeance. No. He
           finds you.

                          JULIAN
           What's he saying?

                          CHARLIE LING

                          (IN THAI)
           Pull yourself together fat man. If you
           don't talk sense I'll cut off your cock
           and shove it down your throat.

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           I'm telling you the truth. He'll find
           you.
          Choi Yan Lee retreats to the corner of the room.

                          JULIAN
           What did he say?
          Charlie Ling considers Choi Yan Lee. Realizes he's not going to
          get a better answer out of him...

                          CHARLIE LING
           He said you don't find The Angel of
           Vengeance. He finds you...
          Julian considers this for a long time. He realises he's not pointing
          his gun anymore. Puts it away.

                          GORDON
           Are we going to kill him or what?
          The room suddenly feels stuffy. The atmosphere oppressive.
          Julian's got to get out...

                          GORDON (CONT'D)
           What are you doing?
          But Julian's already stumbling out of the kiosk...

                          JULIAN
           Nothing... We're not going to do
           anything... Just leave him. Leave them
           all.

          EXT. KIOSK - DAY

          Julian stumbles out of the kiosk and breaths in lungfulls of air.
          Disoriented, he careers into a stall selling various religious
          artefacts, sending candles, incense and statues of Buddha
          flying...
          He falls to the ground. When he gets to his feet everything around
          him seems intense and incredibly vibrant... The dogs fighting
          on the street, the Buddha that lies in pieces on the ground, the
          children that stand watching him, his crew as they come out of
          the kiosk, hiding their guns...
          Julian takes a long moment to get his bearings... Finally he stands
          up, but as he does he feels different... As if the axis of his
          world has shifted...

          INT. THAI BOXING CLUB - NIGHT

          The CAMERA TRACKS from the side as we see Jenna walk through the
          boxing gym. All around her people are fighting and sparring.
          She spots Julian and Gordon through the large windows of the office.
          They see her and stand up.
          We LINGER OUTSIDE in the training area as Jenna goes through THE

          DOOR...

                          CUT TO:

          INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT

          Boxers train in the background. Jenna, Julian and Gordon sit in
          silence. Finally:

                          JENNA
           Did you kill him?
          Beat. A shared look between Gordon and Julian.

                          JULIAN
           It's a little bit more complicated than
           that Mum.

                          JENNA
           Complicated? He killed my son...
           What's so fucking complicated about
           that?

                          JULIAN
           Mum, calm down...

                          JENNA
           Don't tell me to calm down. I want him
           dead.
          Beat... Julian does not know how to explain the situation. Jenna
          stares at him.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           We don't forgive. Only God does.

                          JULIAN
           I know, you always say that - but this
           is different...

                          JENNA
           How?
          Silence. Julian doesn't know how to answer. Jenna watches him
          carefully...

                          JULIAN
           Maybe... Maybe Billy had it coming...

                          JENNA
           What are you talking about?

                          JULIAN
           ...because of what he did.
          Jenna thinks it over for a moment.

                          JENNA
           I don't care.

                          JULIAN
           Why?

                          JENNA
           Just don't - some Thai cunt murdered
           your brother and we're not going to let
           him get away with it.

                          JULIAN
           What if... What if it was The Angel of
           Vengeance?
          Jenna stares at her son like he's finally lost the plot.

                          JENNA
           The Angel of fucking what...?

                          JULIAN
           ...it - or he - restores karma and order
           in the world.

                          JENNA
           'Restores' things? Who said anything
           about 'restoring' things?
          Beat.

                          JULIAN
           He loves all humans...

                          JENNA
           I don't know what kind of spiritual
           journey you're on, but you will kill

                          HIM--

                          JULIAN
           I'm not, I'm just...
          Julian can't get the words out. He gets up.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           ... I've got to go.
          ...and Julian leaves - letting the door to the office stay open.
          We pick up the sounds of the fighters training outside as we slowly
          ZOOM IN on Jenna. She turns to Gordon.

                          JENNA
           How's business?

                          GORDON
           It's alright, yeah. Well, what with
           Billy not being around, it's tricky to
           be honest...

                          JENNA
           What d'you mean?

                          GORDON
           Well, we're supposed to be moving five
           keys out the end of this week. But
           Billy's not here, is he?

                          JENNA
           I'm here. Julian's here.
          Gordon shrugs. Jenna clocks it.

                         

                         

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           What's gotten into him...? Is he high
           or something?

                          GORDON
           I don't know. Earlier today - we had
           the guy... The guy that killed Billy.
           Had a gun against his face. But then
           - nothing...

                          JENNA
           Nothing?

                          GORDON
           Julian let him go. Now there's all this
           stuff about angels... I don't know what
           the fuck's wrong with him.

                          JENNA
           Not like you...
          Gordon smiles at her uncertainly.

                          GORDON
           I know how to do what needs to be done.
           That's all.
          She stares at him, long enough to make him uncomfortable.

                          JENNA
           So tell me... What did he mean when he
           said it was complicated?

                          GORDON
           There's this other guy... Might have
           been involved...

                          JENNA
           So we kill them both.

                          GORDON
           We don't know who the other guy is yet...

                          JENNA
           Okay. Well how about we start with the
           guy we do know?

                          CUT TO:

          INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT

          A girl sings 'Another Woman's Man' by Dolly Parton.
          Julian's sitting alone at a table, nursing a drink.
          Mai enters, looking much more sophisticated than when we saw her
          in the hotel. She sits next to Julian and gives him a kiss on
          the cheek.

                          MAI
           Sorry I'm late.

                          JULIAN
           It's alright...
          He drinks his drink. Silence...

                          MAI
           What's wrong?

                          JULIAN
           Nothing.
          Mai looks around the bar... It's half empty - some girls and men
          spread out.
          The waitress comes over and Mai orders a drink. They sit in silence,
          listening to the song...

                          MAI
           See anyone you want us to take home
           tonight?
          Julian glances round but shakes his head. Looks at Mai.

                          MAI (CONT'D)
           What?

                          JULIAN
           Nothing...

                          MAI
           What's with you? You want to get high?
          Beat. Silence. Finally...

                          JULIAN
           I want you to meet my Mum.
          A pause, Mai slightly taken about.

                          MAI
           Is she here?
          Julian nods.

                          MAI (CONT'D)
           D'you want me to?
          Julian nods. Mai studies him.

                          MAI (CONT'D)
           Why d'you want me to meet her?

                          JULIAN
           To show her... To show that I've got
           something here...

                          MAI
           What, like we're a couple?
          Julian stares at her for a long time. Can't quite say it out loud,
          but the answer's yes.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. CHOI YAN LEE'S SHACK - NIGHT

          Choi Yan Lee oversees his daughter's serving hot food to customers.
          FOCUS ON Liang, the young kick boxer, watching him from across
          the street. Liang pulls out a knife which glints in the light
          of the street lamps. He heads over to the shack.
          Liang asks Choi Yan Lee a question. Choi Yan Lee leans over to
          hear him better. Liang GRABS hold of his hair and PULLS him over
          the counter, SLITTING his throat with the knife.
          Choi Yan Lee's wife and daughters look on as blood floods from
          his neck, over the sweets and snacks on sale and down to the ground
          below.
          Life slips away from Choi Yan Lee in a matter of seconds. Liang
          holds onto him until he's dead and then lets go of his head and
          runs off into the night.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. BANGKOK STREET - NIGHT

          Gordon is waiting on a street corner smoking cigarettes. Liang
          comes up to him, breathless.
          Gordon pulls out several hundred dollars.

                          GORDON
           Never come back - you understand me?
          Liang nods.

                          GORDON (CONT'D)
           Good...
          Liang takes the money. A proper pay out.

                          GORDON (CONT'D)
           You're a fighter, kid. No doubt about
           it. Good luck with that.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. BACK ROOM - DAY

          Julian's talking to Liang's Mother and Sister who are sitting
          in front of him, both upset. Gordon hovers in the background...

                          JULIAN
           When did you last see him?

                          LIANG'S SISTER
           Last night. He went out.

                          JULIAN
           Did he have any enemies?

                          LIANG'S SISTER
           None.

                          LIANG'S MOTHER

                          (IN THAI)
           Someone called him.

                          LIANG'S SISTER
           Someone called his mobile.

                          JULIAN
           Who?

                          LIANG'S SISTER
           She doesn't know. They spoke in
           English.
          Liang's Mother pulls out a mobile phone. Passes it to Julian.

                          JULIAN
           This his phone?
          Liang's Sister nods. Julian scrolls through the numbers. All have
          Thai names against them - except one. Julian considers the number,
          then redials.
          A beat. Then the SOUND of a phone ringing in the same room.
          Gordon looks round. Realises he's busted. Takes his phone out.
          Kills it.
          Julian stares at him. Before he gets a chance to say anything,
          there is a knock on the door.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           What is it?

           THAI MAN (V.O.)
           There's some cops here to see you.

                          JUILAN
           What do they want?

           THAI MAN (V.O.)
           Probably just money. You want me to find
           out how much?
          Julian thinks it over...

                          JULIAN
           No, I'll talk to them.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. BOXING CLUB - DAY

          Julian clocks the cops who are waiting for him. He walks over,
          strangely on edge. As he gets closer he sees Chang - standing
          on the other side of the room by the boxing ring, his back to
          him, watching the sparring fighters... Julian stares at him...
          Turns back to the cops...

                          JULIAN
           Good morning officers. How can I help
           you?
          Slowly Chang turns to face him. Julian stares at him as if he's
          in a trance...

                          KIM
           We're investigating the murder of Choi
           Yan Lee.
          Julian recovers. Turns to Kim and shrugs.

                          JULIAN
           Never heard of him.

                          KIM
           His arm was cut off. Here.
          Julian manages to cover his reaction.

                          JULIAN
           I run a boxing club. Not much call for
           one armed men.
          A beat. Mexican stand off.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           What's this got to do with me?

                          KIM
           He was the father of the girl that was
           found dead with your brother.

                          JULIAN
           Then I guess you boys have got a lot
           of work to do - so have I, so if you'll
           excuse me...

                          KIM
           That's why we're here Mr Hopkins. If
           you could just answer our questions.

                          JULIAN
           Sure, sorry. What do you want to know?
          Julian looks over to Chang who continues staring at the boxers.
          The way the ring is lit he's almost silhouetted.

                          KIM
           Where were you last night?

                          JULIAN
           With my mum...
          Some of the boxers come over to Chang. They know him. They're
          reverential. With the effect of the lighting, it seems to Julian
          like they're bowing down before a God.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           You want to speak to her?

                          KIM
           That wont be necessary at the moment.

                          JULIAN
           Am I suspect?
          Chang turns round to face Julian. His presence is magnetic. Julian
          stares back at him, realizing that this must be the Angel of
          Vengeance... Chang walks over to them. Studies Julian for a long
          moment and then turns to Kim.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           This is not the man.
          And as soon as he's said it, he turns on his heel and leaves.
          The cops back off and away.
          ZOOM IN on Julian. Deflated and strangely disappointed... He turns
          to Gordon who's standing behind him.

                          JULIAN
           I want you to find out who that guy is.
           Okay?

                          GORDON
           Sure. No problem.

                          JULIAN
           Now.
          The SOUND of Nadee singing 'LONELY COMING DOWN' by Dolly Parton.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. KARAOKE BAR

          Chang sits on his own drinking apple juice as he watches his wife
          sing on stage. Julian enters, sees Chang but can only see the
          back of his face. He walks over to the bar, orders a drink.
          Julian starts to watch Nadee. When he turns back to the bar he
          sees Chang reflected in the optics - somehow standing right next
          to him, staring at him. Julian turns to face him.

                          CHANG
           Why are you here?

                          JULIAN
           You're him... Aren't you?

                          CHANG
           Who?

                          JULIAN
           The one who killed my brother.
          Chang says nothing for a long time.

                          CHANG
           I love all living things.
          Beat.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)
           I restore karma. Is that why you came?

                          JULIAN
           I came here to kill you.

                          CHANG
           What's stopping you?

                          JULIAN
           I don't know...

                          CHANG
           Would you like me to tell you?
          Julian nods.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)
           You want the Angel of Vengeance.

                          JULIAN
           Yes.

                          CHANG
           Why?

                          JULIAN
           Cause, all my life... I don't know.

                          CHANG
           Yes you do.

                          JULIAN
           My mother wants me to kill you.
          Chang stares back at him.

                          CHANG
           And what do you want?

                          JULIAN
           ... I love violence.

                          CHANG
           You want to fight me?
          Julian nods.

                          JULIAN
           Thai style.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Three cops sit eating noodles.

                          KIM

                          (IN THAI)
           What about his brain?

                          PHAIBUN

                          (IN THAI)
           It's a risk... One hit in the wrong place
           and he'll be straight back in hospital.
           And maybe he wont be so lucky as last
           time.

                          DAENG

                          (IN THAI)
           Then why's he going to fight the
           Westerner?
          The question hangs in the air. It's what they're all wondering.

                          PHAIBUN
           He used to be a great boxer.

                          KIM
           He has to do it. Since he came out of
           the coma, that's what he's done.
           Whatever's been asked of him, he's done
           it. He can't help it. It's all a
           mystery...
          A mutual pause.

                          DAENG
           And if he loses?

                          PHAIBUN
           He can't lose. He's the Angel of
           Vengeance.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. CHANG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Nadee is standing behind Chang. They're playing a game in which
          they speak in English.
          She points out the window.

                          CHANG
           View.

                          NADEE
           Window.
          `She points at the table.

                          CHANG
           Table.

                          NADEE
           Do you like the table?

                          CHANG
           Yes. I like the table.
          Chang stiffens. Nadee detects the change in him.

                          NADEE
           What is it?
          Chang takes her in his arms. He starts kissing her neck.

                          CHANG
           I need to speak to you in Thai.
          A pause.

                          NADEE

                          (IN THAI)
           What is it?

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           I love you.
          She stares at him for a long moment. It's odd for him to have
          confessed his feelings in such a way. Not bad, just odd. And then
          she starts to kiss him back...

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. STREET - EVENING

          Julian is anxiously waiting outside. He looks up as Mai comes
          out of her appartment in a red dress.
          Julian's face drops.

                          MAI
           What is it?

                          JULIAN
           You can't wear that.

                          MAI
           Why not?

                          JULIAN
           My mother's... Very particular about
           colours.

                          MAI
           You're kidding?

                          JULIAN
           She hates red. Come on, we'll get you
           something else.
          Mai stares at him, reluctant to give in.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           Come on.

                          MAI
           This is insane.

                          JULIAN
           Look, I'm telling you. It's easier this
           way. Trust me.
          Mai gives in. Takes his hand.

          INT. CLOTHES SHOP - NIGHT

          Chang picks out a dress for Mai. She takes it, finding it hard
          to believe that he's making her do this...

                          CUT TO:

          INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Three people sit around a table awkwardly. Julian, Jenna and Mai
          (dressed very conservatively) all eating soup. A long silence.

                          JENNA
           So... May, isn't it?

                          JULIAN
           It's Mai, Mum.

                          JENNA
           How long have you two known each other
           then?
          Mai's about to answer but Juilan gets there first.

                          JULIAN
           A year and a half isn't it?
          Beat as Mai quickly counts in her head...

                          MAI
           ...that sounds about right.

                          JENNA
           Well it's always a rare treat to meet
           one of Julian's lady friends.

                          JULIAN
           Mum, please...

                          JENNA
           So, where did you two meet?

                          JULIAN
           I saw her walking down the street.
          Jenna raises an eyebrow...

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           And I thought - this is the most
           beautiful girl I've ever seen - so I
           just walked up to her and started
           talking.

                          JENNA
           I hear that happens a lot in this part
           of the world... Tell me, what's your
           line of work, Mai?

                          MAI
           I work in the service industry.

                          JENNA
           I bet you do. But tell me Mai, before
           you started serving my son, how many
           cocks were you serving? Was it over a
           thousand?
          Mai stares at Jenna in disbelief.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           I know girls like you. Just because you
           might be pulling the wool over my son's
           eyes don't think it's going to work with
           me.

                          JULIAN
           Mum, stop it, for fuck's sake.

                          JENNA
           I'm sorry Julian, but I won't stand by
           and let a dirty little hooker take
           advantage of my son in the vain hope
           that her womb isn't so diseased that
           she can trick him into impregnating her
           and putting another cocksucking child
           on to this earth.

                          JULIAN
           Leave her alone Mum. You've got her
           wrong. She's a good girl.

                          JENNA
           What do you know about what's good?
          Beat. Julian says nothing.

                          MAI
           He's good to me...

                          JENNA
           Well that's nice isn't it, I'm really
           happy for you--

                          JULIAN
           Mum!
          A pause.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           The cops came by my club today.
          Beat. She stares at him.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           They're investigating a murder. The
           guy that killed Billy turned up dead
           this morning.
          Jenna looks bored. Lights a cigarette.

                          JENNA
           Oh really, shame that, still, live by
           the sword, die by the sword...

                          JULIAN
           I know it was you, Mum.

                          JENNA
           I did what had to be done.

                          JULIAN
           He was there. He was with them.

                          JENNA
           Who?

                          JULIAN
           The Angel of Vengeance.

                          JENNA
           D'you kill him?

                          JULIAN
           No.

                          JENNA
           Cause he as good as killed Billy. What
           I want to know is, what are you going
           to do about it?

                          JULIAN
           I'm not going to kill him...

                          JENNA
           Yes you are. You're going to do it for
           me and you're going to do it for your
           brother.

                          JULIAN
           This isn't about Billy. This is about
           me. All my life I've been running...

                          JENNA
           That's right you cunt, cause you always
           run away whenever there's a problem...
           just like you're running away from
           killing this fucking Angel of whatever

                          -

                          JULIAN
           - his name is Chang-

                          JENNA
           Chang?!
          Mai stands up.

                          MAI
           I should be going now.

                          JENNA
           Sit down you cunt.

                          JULIAN
           Mum, don't talk to her like that.
          Mai sits down.

                          JENNA
           So what am I left with?
          Julian stares at her.

                          JULIAN
           Me.
          Jenna calms down. She looks at their reflections in the mirror
          behind the bar. We ZOOM in on the mirror, their faces refracted
          by the glass.

                          JENNA
           You're right. We're family. We stick
           together. But Billy was family too.

                          JULIAN
           Billy was a fuck up... He deserved
           everything he got. You know it and I
           know it.

                          JENNA
           That's it. I'm not listening to this.
           I don't ever want to hear you mention
           his name again... Do you hear me?

                          JULIAN
           Yeah we were brothers, but we were never
           close... And he was only in Bangkok
           cause you couldn't control him. So you
           sent him to me--

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           -- So you sent him to me and what could
           I do?

                          JENNA
           You could have protected him.

                          JULIAN
           I did what I could. And that's more than
           you ever did.

                          JENNA
           I would've done anything for him. Okay,
           he wasn't born with as many advantages
           as you were. He struggled with things.
           But I always stood by him.

                          JULIAN
           And what did that get him? I'll tell
           you what, a one way ticket to this
           fucking place, just like me.

                          JENNA
           Don't you dare blame me for what
           happened back then.

                          JULIAN
           I'm only here 'cause of you. If you
           didn't exist, I wouldn't be here.
          Beat.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           I could've been someone, Mum. I was on
           my way...
          Jenna stares at him - this is a conversation she does not like
          having...

                          JENNA
           You would've been a great fighter...
           You could've gone pro.

                          JULIAN
           Don't you think I know that? And look
           at me now. I'm a front for a drugs
           smuggling.
          He turns to Mai.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           It's true... The whole thing's a front.
           Every day I see kids coming in with great
           potential. And every day I see kilos
           of heroin going out. And it's all
           because of you, Ma. You and the money
           and the drugs.
          Jenna silently seethes, waiting for Julian to shut the fuck up.
          He quietens down...

                          JENNA
           At least you're not behind bars and
           that's more important to me.
          Julian turns to her - he has been waiting all his life to say
          this.

                          JULIAN
           That's right Mum. That's what's more
           important to you. But what about me?
           Sometimes I think you only got me out
           of there so the cops couldn't trace it
           back to you...
          Jenna stares at him. Her face a mask.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           ...that's right Mum. Think about it.
           With me gone you were safe. And it turned
           out to be good for business as well.
           All very convenient.
          Silence between them. Jenna lights another cigarette - her hands
          now shaking.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           Is that what happened with Billy? Did
           Billy become a problem like I did?
           Wouldn't surprise me, he was a big
           fucking problem when he was here...
           Still, at least you didn't have him
           killed.
          Jenna slaps him hard on the face. Julian recovers. Looks up at
          her. Very intense.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           I'm not going to kill him for you, Mum.
           Doesn't matter what you say. And do you
           want to know why?

                          JENNA
           Surprise me.

                          JULIAN
           'Cause I'm going to fight him. In the
           ring. Me versus him.

                          JENNA
           Well that seems sensible... And what
           do you hope that's going to achieve?

                          JULIAN
           I don't expect you to understand. Cause
           you don't understand anything that
           isn't about you.

                          JENNA
           And when you lose, what's going to
           happen then?

                          JULIAN
           I don't know... But maybe this time I'll
           win. Like you say, only God forgives.
           Maybe this time he'll forgive me...
          Jenna turns to Mai.

                          JENNA
           Do you understand what he's talking
           about? 'Cause I haven't got a fucking
           a clue.

                          JULIAN
           You never did, Mum.
          A pause. Julian's touched a nerve. Jenna recovers.

                          JENNA
           I hope you find what you're looking for.
           'Cause if you don't, it's going to find
           you and I'm not always going to be there
           to look after you.
          Jenna composes herself. Suddenly brightens. A different person.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           Nice to meet you Mai. Hope to see you
           again soon.
          Jenna shakes her hand. Mai's too shocked to resist. And then,
          as if nothing had happened, Jenna leaves.
          Julian covers his face with his napkin.

                          MAI
           Are you alright?
          He's not. He's crying. But he doesn't want anyone to see.

                          JULIAN
           I'm fine.
          Beat.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           I'll be fine. In a minute.
          Julian wipes his face clean. Pulls himself together.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           Sorry about that.

          Jenna gets out of her cab and walks toward reception, a look of
          steely determination in her eyes.

          INT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL - NIGHT

          The Concierge and the Manager see Jenna coming towards them and
          brace themselves...
          However, to their relief, she diverts to the palm court area where
          Gordon is waiting for her.

                          GORDON
           Nice evening?

                          JENNA
           Lovely, yeah. Just catching up, you
           know.
          Jenna sits down. Lights a cigarette.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           You're a piece of work, aren't you?
          Gordon blushes. Jenna blows out her match.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           No fucking hanging about with you, is
           there?

                          GORDON
           Well, I don't know about that. Just been
           out here a while... Know how to get
           things done.

                          JENNA
           I bet you do.

                          GORDON
           But things are going to shit. Since
           Billy died, Julian's all over the
           place...

                          JENNA
           We'll have to something about that the,
           wont we? But, first things first, what
           about Chang?

                          GORDON
           Who?

                          JENNA
           My son's guardian angel.

                          GORDON
           He's just a retired cop...

                          JENNA
           Good, then he won't be to hard to kill,
           will he?

                          GORDON
           It's not that simple... Is there
           somewhere we can go that's a little more
           private?
          Beat. She raises her eyebrows.

                          JENNA
           What did you have in mind?
          Gordon blushes. Moves closer, conspiratorial...

                          GORDON
           You can't just going round killing cops
           here anymore. It's not that easy.

                          JENNA
           I didn't say it was easy. But then,
           you're a resourceful man, aren't you?

                          GORDON
           I looked into it. Chang's a hard man
           to get to. None of the Thais'll go near
           him...

                          JENNA
           Well then you're going to have to find
           someone who's not a fucking Thai then,
           aren't you?

                          GORDON
           There might be a way... But Julian can't
           find out...
          Jenna looks at Gordon - smiles and crosses her legs.

                          JENNA
           Don't you worry about that. There are
           certain things that a mother and son
           shouldn't - and don't - discuss...
          Gordon thinks he does but isn't a hundred per cent sure.

          INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          Julian sits on a chair, holding his hand over a flame. Mai finishes
          applying make up, comes out of the bathroom wearing her red dress.
          She watches him for a moment.

                          MAI
           What are you doing?

                          JULIAN
           Seeing when it hurts.
          Mai watches him. He doesn't flinch.

                          MAI
           I'm going to go.
          Julian takes his hand off the flame. Sees she's left the clothes
          he bought her behind.

                          JULIAN
           Didn't you like what I got you?

                          MAI
           It's fine, but you know... It's not my
           style.

                          JULIAN
           What do you mean?

                          MAI
           Maybe you should give it to your mother.

                          JULIAN
           Don't to be so hard on her. Her life
           hasn't been easy.

                          MAI
           Come on Julian. She's a fucking bitch.

                          JULIAN
           Don't say that, okay? You don't know
           what you're talking about. She'd do
           anything for me.

                          MAI
           The way she talks to you --

                          JULIAN
           Don't go there.

                          MAI
           What? 'Don't talk about my mother'?
           Come on Julian.
          Julian stands up, angry.

                          MAI (CONT'D)
           Why don't you fuck her instead of me?
          Julian grabs hold her neck. Throws her hard against the wall.

                          JULIAN
           You don't get to judge her. You think
           she's bad? You should've met my dad.
           But he's not around anymore, and do you
           know why? Cause she loved me too much.
          He lets go of her neck. Mai rubs her neck.

                          MAI
           You're fucked.
          He pulls money out of his pocket.

                          JULIAN
           How much do I owe you?
          He forces a roll of notes into her hand, forcing her to take it.

                          MAI
           Fuck you.
          She opens the door, sets fire to the money, and walks out of the
          room.
          As she walks down the hotel corridor, Julian slams his fists into
          the wall.

          INT. SKYLIGHT BAR - NIGHT

          A mixed clientele. High class. Asian and European. But there's
          an edge to the atmosphere. The music's that bit too loud, that
          bit too aggressive. And the people inside don't look like they're
          having a good time. It seems evil. Sleazy.
          Jenna introduces herself to Yuri Karkov, a well dressed and
          charismatic Russian in his forties who is surrounded by Thai girls
          and fellow Russians including his distinctive looking bodyguard,
          Dimitri.
          As the camera TRACKS CLOSER to them we start to hear what they're
          saying...

                          YURI KARKOV
           ... so why do you want to kill a
           policeman? Policemen are good. They
           mind their own business and keep the
           streets safe. Stop people stealing my
           cars...

                          JENNA
           You really want to know?

                          YURI KARKOV
           Yes. It may effect the price.

                          JENNA
           He killed my son.

                          YURI KARKOV
           Revenge. Pricey...

                          JENNA
           This is Bangkok. Nothing's that
           expensive.

                          YURI KARKOV
           You're right. Most things are cheap in
           Bangkok. Especially life... We'll take
           care of this business for you. But it
           won't be easy and it won't be cheap.

          EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          A crappy van pulls up outside. Out get three Cambodian men. Very
          poor, badly clothed. They look like farmers. Only they pull out
          semi automatic firearms and head for the restaurant.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Chang has just finished a meal with the Cops including Kim, Daeng
          and Phaiban. Chang is just settling the bill when the Three Gunmen
          walk in. He looks up just as they OPEN FIRE.
          An insane storm of led rains down on the room, shattering all
          the mirrors on the back wall, taking out Two Waitresses and covering
          the room with broken glass.
          Chang hits the floor and starts to drag himself towards some cover.
          Chang's men are completely pinned down. Phaiban's been hit and
          his white shirt has turned dark red with blood.
          Chang keeps edging towards where his jacket's hanging on a chair.
          In it, his pistol.
          The Gunmen keep firing. As soon as a clip is finished, they pull
          it out and put a fresh one in and keep shooting.
          A stray bullet hits the waiter who knocks over the chair Chang's
          jacket's on. It falls to the ground. With it, his pistol. He grabs
          it and returns fire, letting off four rounds.
          He takes Gunman One. Head shot, right between the eyes. Gunman
          Two sees this and sprays at Chang -
          - but Chang manages to dive to cover. He rolls and fires again,
          shooting Gunman Two in the chest three times.
          Chang's out of ammo and needs to reload. Gunman Three's weapon
          jams. He drops his weapon and runs.
          Before he's finished reloading his pistol, Chang's after him.
          He sees Phaiban. Dead. Daeng trying to stem the flow of blood
          from his chest.
          Chang keeps running, determined not to lose his man.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          The driver of the crappy van smokes nervously in the driving seat
          as he waits. As soon as he sees Gunman Three, panic-stricken,
          running in fear, he puts the van in gear, revs the engine and
          starts to pull away.
          Gunman Three runs after him, crying out for him to slow down.
          The Driver slows. Gunman Three struggles to jump into the open
          doors.
          Chang bursts out of the restaurant. Stops dead. Aims and fires
          off two rounds.
          Blood spatters across the inside of the windscreen. The Driver
          falls forward, dead.
          The back door of the van slams shut. Gunman Three thinks he's
          made it. He's wrong. The van isn't going anywhere.
          Chang approaches the back door of the van, ready to fire.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Do you want to die? Do you want me to
           kill you? For what you've done?
          A long pause. Finally:

           GUNMAN THREE (O.S.)

                          (IN THAI)
           No. Please. Don't kill me.

                          (IN THAI)
           Tell me why not. Tell me why I shouldn't
           shoot you as soon as you come out of
           that door.

           GUNMAN THREE (O.S.)

                          (IN THAI)
           I'm sorry?

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Not good enough.

           GUNMAN THREE (O.S.)

                          (IN THAI)
           It's my first time. I've never done
           anything like this before.

                          (IN THAI)
           I know that. You're wearing sandals.
           Hitmen don't wear sandals.
          The door opens. Sandaled feet step out of the van. Gunman Three
          comes out with his hands up, falling to his knees. Chang continues
          to point his weapon at the unarmed man.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           Give me a reason.
          The Cops appear behind him in the doorway. Chang holds his ground.
          His finger twitches. It looks like he's going to pull the trigger.

                          GUNMAN THREE

                          (IN THAI)
           I'm begging you. Please--

                          (IN THAI)
           You showed no mercy in there. Why should
           mercy be shown to you?

          Flanked by the Cops, Chang frog marches Gunman Three through the
          crowds, passing various stalls that seem to sell anything you
          could ever want for your TV, computer or Hi-fi.
          Gunman Three is so scared that he keeps forgetting the route and
          fretting about which way to turn at every junction in the
          warren-like market.
          Finally they reach the entrance to a particular shop.

          Chang enters, followed by the others. Gunman Three is incredibly
          relieved to have found it. Li Po stands behind the counter - beside
          him sits Pan, a twelve year old boy who is severely handicapped.
          As soon as Li Po sees Chang and his crew arrive with Gunman Three
          next to them he knows the game's up. He can't run. His kid's sitting
          there...
          He approaches them with a heavy sigh.

                          (IN THAI)
           Don't talk unless I ask you to.
           Understood?

                          GUNMAN THREE

                          (IN THAI)
           Yes. Completely understood.
          Chang turns to Li Po.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Do you have anything to say for
           yourself?

                          LI PO

                          (IN THAI)
           I'm a salesman. Some of the things I
           sell aren't exactly legal... But I'll
           give you the man that hired the hit...
          Chang stares at him...

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Good...
          Li Po summons the contact details on his distinctive looking mobile
          phone. Proffers it to Chang.

                          LI PO

                          (IN THAI)
           As for myself, I'm not scared of paying
           for what I've done. I just... just don't
           hurt my son.
          Chang looks down at Pan - who is just staring at them, not
          understanding the situation.
          Chang takes the phone from Li Po.

                          GUNMAN THREE

                          (IN THAI)
           You see? He knows. He's got the details.
           I told you he would.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           And I told you not to talk unless I asked
           you.
          Chang aims his gun at Gunman Three.

                          GUNMAN THREE

                          (IN THAI)
           Wait. You said if I took you to him you'd
           let me live.
          Chang shakes his head.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           I never said that.
          Chang fires. Gunman Three's brains spatter across the TV screens
          on the far side of the wall.
          Pan begins to cry and Li Po hugs him and tells him how much he
          loves him... thinking they're next...
          Chang studies the mobile phone.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           This him?
          Li Po nods - scared.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           Where do I find him?

                          LI PO

                          (IN THAI)
           Skylight bar at the Jupiter.. Every
           night.
          Chang studies Li Po making sure he speaks the truth... then nods.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           I'm taking your phone.
          Chang turns to leave.

                          (IN THAI)
           What about me?
          Beat. Chang considers. Looks at Pan who's staring at Chang in
          fear. Looks back at Li Po.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           I forgive you...

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. THE JUPITER - NIGHT

          A people carrier pulls up outside the hotel. The doormen open
          the side door and step back when they see the heavily armed and
          bloodstained policemen get out, led by Chang.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. SKYLIGHT BAR - NIGHT

          PICK OUT Dimitri and the group of Russian Criminals. Yuri Karkov
          is in the centre of them, a girl on either arm.
          Chang leads the Cops into the bar. He fires two shots into the
          ceiling. That shuts everyone up and gets the Russian Criminals
          up and ready for a confrontation. Half the bar's emptied by the
          time Chang reaches Yuri Karkov.

                          YURI
           You better have a fucking good reason
           for doing this. Don't you know who
           you're fucking with.
          Chang looks at him.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           You live in my country. Can't speak my
           language... Too bad the one guy on my
           team that could speak English got
           murdered today.
          Yuri looks round for help. He can't understand a word.

                          YURI
           Can someone tell me what the fuck this
           guy's trying to say...
          Chang calls over to the barman.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Can you turn the music off. It won't
           be long, I promise.
          The music's killed.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           That's better. Thank you very much...
          Chang pulls out Li Po's distinctive mobile phone.
          Dimitri, currently flanking Yuri, turns white.
          Chang calls a number. A beat. Then a phone starts ringing in
          Dimitri's jacket pocket (with a really cheesy ringtone). Dimitri
          winces. Chang shakes his head.
          Yuri pulls a gun. Kim shoots him dead. Chang moves his gun across
          to Dimitri. Holds his mobile phone up to his ear.
          Dimitri answers. Chang speaks through the phone.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN ENGLISH)
           You're under arrest...

                          CUT TO:

          INT. SKYLIGHT BAR - LATER

          WE TRACK IN on Dimitri as he stares at Chang, a rabbit in the
          headlights. Chang slowly sits down next to him. Talks to him in
          English.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)
           I need information.
          Phaiban spins a spotlight onto Dimitri.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)
           And you're going to help me.
          Suddenly the atmosphere in the emptied club shifts. It's as if
          Dimitri and Chang are locked into some kind of surreal
          performance...

                          CHANG (CONT'D)
           Whether you like it or not.
          Dimitri's body starts to shake in fear.

                          DIMITRI
           It was an English woman - she wanted
           you dead...
          A beat. Not what Chang expected...

                          CHANG
           Why?

                          DIMITRI
           Said you... murdered her son....

                          CHANG
           Who was she?

                          DIMITRI
           I don't know...

                          CHANG
           How did she know me?
          Dimitri shakes his head. He really doesn't know.

                          DIMITRI
           She asked for you by name...

                          CHANG
           And what's my name?

                          DIMITRI

                          CHANG--
          Chang starts to circle him. Dimitri's terrified. Doesn't know
          what the fuck he's on about. Suddenly he's grabbed from behind
          by Phaiban.
          Chang smashes a beer bottle and walks up behind Dimitri...

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           I see the way you look at my people.
           The way you abuse them with your eyes.
           For this, I take your sight.
          He pushes the broken bottle into Dimitri's eyes. Gauges them out.
          Dimitri screams hysterically - calling out for his mother in
          Russian...

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           You live in my country, but you fail
           to learn our language. You don't even
           try. For this I take your tongue...
          Phaibun grabs Dimitri's head from behind. Chang presses down on
          his stomach with his knee and opens his mouth - grabs hold of
          his tongue and with a blade slowly cuts it off.
          ...Dimitri's screams become more like the howls of a dying
          animal...
          Chang looks at him and his men release Dimitri who stumbles around
          the room like a chicken without a head...

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           You had opportunities. You could have
           chosen other paths... But you wouldn't
           listen... For this I give you
           silence...
          Chang grabs Dimitri and pushes the knife into his ear. First one
          side, then the other.
          SOUND OUT. We can't hear Dimitri's screaming. We can't hear
          anything at all.
          Beat.
          MUSIC STARTS. Painful and beautiful, but also tacky... The opening
          bars to one of Dolly Parton's classics. Karaoke style.

           NADEE (V.O.)
           If I should stay, I would only be in
           your way.
           So I'll go, but I know I'll think of
           you every step of the way.
          And Chang with his crew just stare at the tortured Russian as
          he screams until his lungs are ready to burst.

           NADEE (V.O.)
           Bittersweet memories that is all I'm
           taking with me.
           So, goodbye. Please don't cry,
          Jenna walks in from the bedroom wearing her dressing gown and
          walks over to him - a commanding presence. He makes to get up
          but she pushes him down and then leans down and kisses him hard
          on the mouth.

           CHANG (V.O.)
           We both know that I'm not what you, you

          INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT

          As Chang waits for the instrumental section to end, he starts
          to cry, letting the tears flow without embarrassment. Nadee puts
          her arm around him to comfort him.
          The rest of the crew start crying as well, Daeng in particular.

                          NADEE
           I hope life treats you kind

          INT. THAI BOXING RING - NIGHT

          Two figures kneel on either side of the ring. Julian and Chang.
          Both wearing Mongkol. Totally still.
          The ceremonial music begins...
          Slowly Julian and Chang start to perform Ram Muay, the ancient,
          traditional dance which the rules of the game say must be carried
          out before a fight takes place.
          It is both strange and spiritual: Julian and Chang move their
          arms rhythmically, in time to the music, their hands describing
          shapes and outlining fighting positions.
          As the dance develops, so their positions become more combative;
          now crouching, now standing, hinting at the kicks and punches
          that they're about to perform... but all carried out with an almost
          beatific precision that is at odds with the violence that is about
          to follow...

           FADE OUT.
          The Music Ends. A moment of stillness, and then slowly we bring
          up the SOUND of the baying crowd. Chanting. Screaming. Wild
          excitement. Ready for the fight they've all been waiting for...

                         FADE IN:

          INT. THAI BOXING RING - NIGHT

          The crowd is packed. In one corner: Julian. Charlie Ling beside
          him along with Ko Sam. He looks focussed. Confident.
          In the other corner: Chang. Kim next to him along with a couple
          of his crew. He looks incredibly calm.
          The first bell sounds. Five second warning...
          Chang looks over into the crowd. Kanita with Nadee. Kanita offers
          him a 'thumbs up'. Chang smiles. Returns it.
          Julian looks over. Sees Mai take a seat. She holds his gaze.
          The second bell sounds. The first of five rounds. Julian and Chang
          walk up to the centre of the ring. The Referee stands between
          them. Brings them together. A quick look down to the Three Judges.
          Then a look between the two fighters.
          Julian eyes Chang. Steely determination in his eyes. Chang looks
          back at him without emotion.

                          REFEREE

                          (IN THAI)
           Fight.
          Julian and Chang circle each other. Julian moves in to attack
          first. He throws a straight left first to Chang's face and steps
          his left foot forward at the same time. Chang bends his right
          leg, dodging the attack. He then pounces on the upper part of
          Julian's arm with his right hand and catches his wrist with his
          left hand. He tries to turn Julian's front wrist up, but Julian's
          too strong. This is a surprise for Chang. He breaks and steps
          back.
          Julian moves in to attack again, raising both elbows to make an
          attack on Chang's head. Chang steps forward and pulls an uppercut,
          connecting hard with Julian's chin. Julian moves back, dazed.
          Takes a moment to get his bearings back. That hurt.
          Chang doesn't take the opportunity to attack. He hangs back.
          Waiting for Julian to come at him again. This pisses Julian off.
          He moves forward and throws an offensive kick with his right foot.
          Chang moves back to dodge the attack and swivels to try and strike
          with a counter attack. He moves too slow. The right footed attack
          was a feint. Julian slams his right foot down on the floor and
          uses it to swivel, unleashing a kick with his left which connects
          with Chang's jaw and sends him flying back.
          Julian uses his forward motion to propel him onwards. He bounds
          over to the disoriented Chang and hits him with a series of jabs
          and punches to his upper body and face.
          Chang's almost on the ropes. Julian comes in hard with kicks to
          the shins with his right foot. Chang bends his body to pass under
          Julian's right foot. Julian misses the target. Chang manages to
          place his right foot on Julian's left knee-joint which makes him
          fall down.
          Julian's in a vulnerable position, but Chang doesn't move to make
          the killer blow. He steps back to let him recover. Again this
          enrages Julian.
          He gets up and moves forward towards Chang. He comes in with a
          high right kick. Again Chang manages to dodge the attack and returns
          with a right foot to the back of Julian's left knee. Julian swivels,
          punches air, and gets a trio of punches in his gut. His guard's
          down. But again no killer punch.

                          JULIAN
           Come on.
          Chang retreats. Shrugs at Julian. You come on.
          Julian moves towards him, but before he gets a chance to take
          out his frustrations, the bell goes. End of round one.
          Julian stalks back to his corner. He turns to look at Chang, a
          look of intense anger and frustration.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. THAI BOXING RING - NIGHT

          Julian moves towards the middle where Chang is already waiting.
          Julian waits for Chang this time. Chang is reluctant to attack.
          A waiting game... Who will strike first... Chang wins. Julian
          moves to kick Chang in the ribs, keeping both his hands down as
          he moves in. Chang predicts this and prepares to throw his own
          kick as it comes in. Chang steps back, but again Julian swivels,
          using his right foot instead to pivot and unleashes a killer strike
          with his left foot. Chang goes flying backwards.
          PICK OUT the look of concern etched on the faces of Nadee and
          Kanita.
          Chang recovers but Julian moves in fast with a series of punches
          and elbows. Chang's on the ropes now and getting badly beaten.
          He clings on to Julian to limit the damage.

                          REFEREE

                          (IN THAI)
           Break.
          The two fighters step back from each other. Chang's face is damaged.
          Juilan's about to get stuck into him again when the bell sounds.
          End of the second round.
          Round three: Julian slamming punches into Chang. Nadee comforting
          Kanita. Telling her it'll be okay. Chang responding with kicks
          and elbows. Defensive blocks and counter attacks. Mai willing
          Julian on. Jenna watching with Gordon...
          End of round: Julian feeling more confident. Again his eyes scan
          the crowd. This time he sees what he's looking for: Jenna.
          Chang eyeballs Julian from the other corner. Sees him staring
          into the crowd. Looks over. Tries to see what he's looking at
          but can't make it out.
          POV from Chang as he sees Jenna make her way toward Julian. When
          she gets to him we see her saying something to Julian about the
          fight - urging him to hit harder...
          Jenna then walks back to Gordon...
          On Chang. Deep in thought. He gets up early. Walks around the
          ring. Looking into the crowd.
          Jenna sees him. Stares at him. Suddenly nervous.
          Everything slows down as Chang clocks her again. The colours of
          the room change from blue to yellow to red. He's seen her and
          she knows she's been seen. And he knows. And she knows that he
          knows...
          The bell goes off. Back to reality. Chang turns round. Too late.
          He gets a massive blow to his head. He goes down hard.
          The Referee starts counting.
          Nadee and Kanita watch on, fearful.
          Jenna holds her breath. Hopeful that he might be down and out.
          Kim watches on, concerned.

                          KIM

                          (IN THAI)
           Get up. Please get up.
          After a long, terrible pause... Chang gets up. He looks over into
          the crowd. Makes eye contact with his wife. It's okay.
          She shakes her head. She can't bear it. Tears running down her
          face.
          Back on his feet, Chang suddenly drops his guard. Julian hesitates,
          confused. Chang leans in close to him. Winks.

                          CHANG
           It wasn't you, was it?
          Julian shrugs, puts his guard up.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)
           You're innocent.

                          JULIAN
           What are you talking about?

                          CHANG
           It's not your fault.
          Chang raises his arms again. Ready to fight. Julian gets ready
          to attack but something's changed. The fire's gone out of him.
          He looks over to his mother, to Mai, Chang's words echoing in
          his mind.
          It's not his fault.
          Then Chang comes in with a flurry of punches. Left, right, left,
          right. Julian just takes them...
          Chang pauses in the onslaught. Julian stays motionless in the
          middle of the ring.
          Chang runs at him, flings his right foot, swivels, pulling out
          a roundhouse left kick -
          - which makes contact with Julian's draw.
          SLOW MOTION as Julian's head takes the impact.
          He's out cold before he hits the floor.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. CORRIDORS - NIGHT

          Jenna hurries down the corridor. She reaches the dressing room
          door. She's about to knock but she stops. She opens the door silently
          and lets herself in.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. CHANGING ROOMS - NIGHT

          Julian's sitting on the treatment table, his face covered in cuts
          and bruises...
          Jenna watches him in silence from the shadows, steadies her
          breathing and then slips back out of the room.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. CORRIDORS - NIGHT

          Jenna comes out of the changing rooms as Mai approaches. Jenna
          shakes her head.

                          JENNA
           He doesn't want to see anyone.
          Mai is disappointed. Doesn't know what to say.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           Just give him time...

                          MAI
           ...tell him I came?

                          JENNA
           Of course.
          Jenna hugs Mai close.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           We'll get him through this together.

          INT. CHANGING ROOMS - NIGHT

          Julian turns when he hears a knock at the door. Says nothing.
          Jenna enters and closes the door behind her. She stands there
          for a moment as if considering what to say...

                          JENNA
           You deserved to win. You should've

                          WON--

                          JULIAN
           Give it a break mum. Just... give it
           as rest.
          He steps into the light. She reaches out to touch him.

                          JENNA
           I'll never get use to seeing you get
           hurt - even when you win.

                          JULIAN
           Yeah, well I lost.

                          JENNA
           And did it make a difference?
          Julian says nothing.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           I want to know... Did it make a
           difference?
          Slowly he shakes his head.

                          JULIAN
           ... No... it didn't make a
           difference... No difference at all.

                          JENNA
           And how do you feel now?

                          JULIAN
           Nothing. I don't feel anything at all.

                          JENNA
           Don't you see, that's how I felt when
           Billy died...
          Julian studies his mother.

                          JULIAN
           What do you want, Mum?
          Beat.

                          JENNA
           What d'you think I want? I want it to
           be like it used to be... I don't want
           to lose you...
          Jenna starts crying. Could be real, could be an act - hard to
          tell she's so good...

                          JULIAN
           What's wrong Mum?
          She shakes her head. Can't say it.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           What's wrong?

                          JENNA
           He knows... He knows it was me.

                          JULIAN
           Who does?
          Beat. Jenna says nothing. Julian thinks... Cogs turn...

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           Chang?
          Jenna nods.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           What did you do, Mum? What did you do?
          Jenna makes her hand into a pistol. Pretends to fire it into her
          skull. She tried to have Chang killed. Julian's speechless.

                          JENNA
           He's going to come after me. And after
           he's come after me, he's going to come
           after you.
          Julian stares at his mother; fragile, terrified, alone.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           I'm scared, Julian.
          Julian stares at his mother.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           What are we going to do?
          Julian begins to realize what he has to do... and he looks at
          his hands. Finally...

                          JULIAN
           We'll be okay - I'll do it, I'll take
           him out...

                          JENNA
           Not just him. We've got to take them
           all out.
          Julian stares at her - the power she has over him...

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           Kill them all. The final solution.

          Chang tucks in his daughter. Nadee watches from the doorway.
          Kanita still has some dolls on her bed. He starts taking them
          off. Notices one of them is broken.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           What happened to the princess' head?

                          KANITA

                          (IN THAI)
           The monsters were angry. They bit it
           off.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           I thought the King banished them all

                          KANITA

                          (IN THAI)
           These were new monsters. The woods are
           full of them.
          Chang holds the broken princess' body. A sudden wave of fear washes
          over him. A sense of doom.

                          KANITA (CONT'D)

           of Bangkok's finest, blah blah blah,
           came out of a coma that lasted for an
           entire year, waking up as if nothing
           had happened... Wife was really happy,
           blah blah blah... "It's hard to
           describe" Chang said, "but I do feel
           different."
          Charlie starts to sneer as he reads. Julian is listening intently.

           metaphysical, impossible to

          Nadee and Kanita come out of the elevator and Nadee quickly sees
          that police guard from before has been replaced by someone else
          (Ko Sam)...
          Ko Sam smiles...

                          KO SAM

                          (IN THAI)
           I'm the new guard. Please, go on in.
          Nadee looks at him suspiciously but enters the apartment with
          Kanita. Ko Sam pretends to go back to reading his Manga comic.

          Jenna sips tea from a China cup. She puts it back down on to her
          saucer. Kim is sitting opposite her. Chang stands in the
          background.

                          JENNA
           I came here to collect my son's body.
           Now it's released, my business in
           Bangkok is completed.

                          KIM
           When are you leaving?

                          JENNA
           Tonight.

                          KIM
           And your other son - is he going with
           you?

                          JENNA
           I've had no real contact with Julian
           since he ran away.

                          KIM
           You watched him fight.
          Jenna looks over to Chang.

                          JENNA
           I watched him lose. And he deserved to.
           You were the better fighter. My only
           sadness is that Billy got caught up in
           what he's doing out here. And paid for
           it with his life.
          Kim and the rest of the crew take this in.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           I'll never testify against my own flesh
           and blood, Officer Chang. But he's a
           killer.
          Chang senses something. Starts to become agitated.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           ... It pains me to say it, but my own
           son is a killer. He killed a cop back
           in England ten years ago. He's been on
           the run ever since. I say son... But
           he hasn't been a son to me.
          Chang stares at the door to the bedroom. Feels the presence of
          someone the other side of the door.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           Not for a long time. Not since he killed
           that cop back home... That was ten years
           ago. He's been running ever since. And
           he'll never stop until he's caught.
           Until you catch him.
          Chang starts to push the door open...
          Behind him Jenna stands up.
          Before Chang fully opens the door, his mobile phone rings. It
          sounds INCREDIBLY loud. He takes it out and looks at the display
          with a feeling of dread.
          He answers...

          Kanita is standing in the middle of the room, staring at Julian.
          Charlie Ling leans against the opposite wall, a pistol in his
          hand.
          Nadee remains silent, trying to think fast.

          her... Kanita closes the door.
          Beat - silence...
          Julian stands up and walks toward Nadee - raises his shotgun and
          blows her head off.
          Blood spatters onto the wall, bits of brain and skull everywhere

          Chang stops in his tracks. It's as if he can feel the shotgun
          blast in his heart. He knows what's just happened... He stands
          still. He closes his eyes as if he had only to wish to make it
          all go away... He opens them again to see...
          The street is completely deserted. Chang stands alone in the middle
          of a ghost town.

           Wait...
          Julian turns back. Charlie Ling nods towards Kanita's room.

           CHARLIE LING (CONT'D)
           The kid.
          Julian shakes his head.

                          JULIAN
           No way.

                          CHARLIE LING

                          SHE SAID--

          Beat.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)

          Charlie Ling nods.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           What kind of a mother says that?

                          CHARLIE LING
           If you've got a problem, talk to her.

                          JULIAN
           No. We're not doing it.

                          CHARLIE LING
           You don't have to. I will.
          Charlie Ling kicks open the door. Julian realises he can't let
          him do it.
          And as Charlie Ling sees Kanita... Julian shoots him in the back.
          Charlie Ling slumps to the floor.
          Julian approaches the doorway. He looks in. Sees Kanita sitting
          on her bed. She stares at Julian, Charlie Ling's dead body at
          his feet. They hold each other's gaze... and then Julian slowly
          bows his head and leaves...

          EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - DAY

          Julian stumbles out of the apartment, desperately catching his
          breath. He ends up leaning on a stall - similar to the one he
          knocked over outside Choi Yan Lee's kiosk. Candles and incense.
          Buddha's smiling back at him...
          Julian looks around him and again everything seems intense and
          incredibly vibrant... A group of school children, all of whom
          are Downs Syndrome, are crossing the road. Smiles plastered across
          their faces... Julian stares at them... Their presence seems to
          have a calming effect on him, as if they're giving him new energy
          to do what he's starting to realize he has to do next.

          INT. LIFT - DAY

          Lift music. Julian stands perfectly still in the lift as it goes

          INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

          As Julian walks down the corridor he takes the shotgun out - holds
          it out in front of him as if it were a sacred weapon...
          He reaches the door to his mother's room and pauses.
          Julian stares at the door as if it was heaven's gate... He loads
          the shotgun with two fresh cartridges.

                          JULIAN
           Only God forgives. And now mother -
           you will die...
          He rings the bell, raising the shotgun, ready to shoot. The door

                         OPENS -
          - but it's Gordon who opens it, dressed in a bathrobe.
          Confused, Julian continues to level the weapon at his head. Gordon
          backs away into the room.

                          GORDON
           Easy...
          Julian says nothing. Edges into the room. The gun still pointed
          at Gordon's head.
          Julian says nothing. Kicks the door closed with his foot.

                          JULIAN
           Where's is she?

                          GORDON
           She's gone... Picked up Billy's
           body... She's gone home.
          Finally Julian lowers the shotgun.

                          GORDON (CONT'D)
           Didn't she tell you?
          Julian sits down.

                          GORDON (CONT'D)
           You alright mate? D'you want
           something?
          Julian mumbles to himself... then turns to Gordon. Realisation
          dawning on him:

                          JULIAN

          INT. UNDERGROUND CARPARK - DAY

          Gordon and Julian walk towards Gordon's car, the sounds of their
          footsteps ricocheting off the concrete walls.
          Reaching the car, Gordon stands by the driver's door as Julian
          heads for the passenger's side.
          Gordon pauses before unlocking the door. Looks over to Julian,
          talking across the roof of the car.

                          GORDON
           We're good mates aren't we?
          Beat. Julian's instantly suspicious...

                          JULIAN
           ... Yeah.

                          GORDON
           I'm sorry about this Julian. I wish
           there was another way...
          Gordon levels a pistol at Julian's head.

                          JULIAN
           What did she say? What did she promise
           you?

                          GORDON
           Don't make this harder--
          GUNSHOT. A bullet RIPS through Julian's shoulder. He falls back
          on the car behind him setting off a chorus of car alarms.
          Gordon starts to walk round to deliver the killer blow.

                          GORDON (CONT'D)
           You've become a liability. You can see
           that, can't you?
          Julian looks at the wound. It's deep but he's not totally
          incapacitated. He pulls the shotgun out from under his shirt.
          It clatters to the floor.

                          GORDON (CONT'D)
           And now she wants me to take over. She
           wants me to be the favoured son. What
           am I supposed to say?
          Julian sinks to his knees, leaning over to pick up the shotgun.
          He's got seconds...

                          GORDON (CONT'D)
           I didn't want it to end like this. First
           I fuck your mother. Then I--
          Gordon turns the corner - but Julian's in position. Two shots
          in quick succession. Both barrels fired at Gordon's chest.
          The force of the explosion FLINGS Gordon's body against the far
          wall of the car park. Dead instantly.
          Julian pulls himself up and stands there, the smoking shotgun
          acting as a makeshift crutch. He gazes at Gordon's steaming corpse,
          appalled by the turn of events...

          INT. TOILET - DAY

          Julian takes the top off a vodka bottle with his teeth. He pours
          the spirit over his wound. It stings like hell and Julian screams
          in agony.

          EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - DUSK

          Julian walks out into the night, the neon glow turning the streets
          into a modern day Hades....
          Although the wound isn't life threatening, Julian's face is pale
          from the loss of blood. He looks like a ghost.
          He sees two cops chatting on a street corner. They don't see him,
          they're not even looking for him, but they remind him. Chang.
          It's just a matter of time...
          Julian keeps walking. Wipes sweat from his face. Looking for a
          place to hide. A hole in the ground. Anything.
          Then suddenly it comes to him. A single idea. A possible way of
          escape...

          The work is being carried out by Mai who has a lowly position
          in a massive and sterile industrial kitchen. Not the sort of life
          she planed on having...
          A Co-Worker calls out to her...

                          CO-WORKER

                          (IN THAI)
           Mai. Some guy's out there asking for
           you.
          Mai finishes the last napkin and places it on the pile. She walks
          towards the exit, passing her Co-Worker...

                          CO-WORKER (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           Don't forget it's supposed to be my
           break next.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Mai comes from round a corner and sees Julian leaning against
          the wall. She checks that they're alone, knowing instinctively
          that he's in trouble.

                          MAI
           What happened to you?
          Beat. Julian almost smiles.

                          JULIAN
           I've got to get out of Bangkok. Didn't
           want to leave...
          He winces.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           ... without saying goodbye.

                          MAI
           Who did this to you?
          A pause.

                          JULIAN
           My mother... She made me what I am. And
           now I've got nothing. And they're after
           me.
          Mai stares at him.

                          MAI
           Come with me...
          Julian looks at her.

                          MAI (CONT'D)
           ...to Cambodia - we can hide there...
           You'll be safe there.
          Mai and Julian smile at each other. It's sweet. Innocent.

                          JULIAN
           I got about twelve grand at the club...
           Should be enough to get us there. Set
           ourselves up. Disappear...

                          MAI
           Now?

                          JULIAN
           Right now.
          Mai looks around - they're alone.

                          MAI
           Wait outside...

                          CUT TO:

          INT. / EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Julian watches as Mai comes into the Restaurant from the kitchen
          and walks over to the bar area...
          Making sure no one's watching, Mai starts to pull money out of
          the til...
          Julian looks over at the shop front next to him... A Travel Agency.
          Pictures of holidays and beaches. Paradise. It all seems in his
          grasp.
          Mai comes up to him...

                          MAI
           Let's go.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. TAXI - NIGHT

          Mai and Julian are in the Taxi. He puts his arm around her. They're
          on their way...

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. THAI BOXING CLUB - NIGHT

          The taxi pulls up outside Juilan's club.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. TAXI - NIGHT

          Julian gets out of the taxi.

                          JULIAN
           Stay here. If I'm not out in five
           minutes... Go.
          Mai nods.

                          MAI
           Five minutes.
          Julian nods and slams the door shut. Mai watches Juilan disappear
          into the building.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. THAI BOXING CLUB - NIGHT

          We PAN THROUGH Julian's empty club. It's silent and empty like
          a tomb...
          We PICK UP Julian as he hurries through towards his office.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT

          Back where we first met him...
          Julian flings open the door to his safe and starts pulling wads
          of money into a canvas hold all.
          He's about to leave when he notices someone standing in the shadows
          behind him.
          Slowly, out of the darkness, a series of figures appear like
          vampires... Chang and the Cops. Impossible to say how long they've
          been standing there...
          Chang and Julian stare at each other...

                          CHANG
           Let's go.
          We TRACK IN to a CLOSE SHOT on Julian. It's almost as if this
          moment was inevitable.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. THAI BOXING CLUB - NIGHT

          Chang brings Julian out of the club. A police car is waiting outside.
          Mai sits in the back seat.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. BANGKOK - NIGHT

          The police car drives through the city streets and onto the freeway
          heading out of town.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

          Daeng is driving. Kim sits next to him. Daeng looks into the rearview
          mirror to see--
          Julian and Mai sitting next to Chang. Mai looks scared... Julian
          more accepting of his fate...

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. BANGKOK - NIGHT

          The Police Car heads over the Mega Bridge and continues its way
          out of town.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. CAR - NIGHT

          They all sit in the car in silence.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAWN

          The Police Car pulls up.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

          Chang leads Juilan across the field. The Cops follow a few steps
          behind with Mai.
          Suddenly, and completely unexpectedly, Chang punches Julian in
          the gut... Julian falls to the floor and Chang starts to viciously
          attack him, punching and kicking him.
          Finally Julian, unable to defend himself, is lying on the ground,
          immobile.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Get up.
          Julian rolls over. Eyes Chang. Slowly he starts to get up onto
          his knees. They continue, Chang forcing Julian to crawl as they
          make their way further into the field.
          Then Chang stops...

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           Get up. Now.
          Julian struggles to get up to his feet, but before he does, Chang
          kicks him hard in the chest, sending him back down to the floor.

                          JULIAN
           I'm sorry...

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Do you have anything to say?

                          JULIAN
           Don't hurt her.
          He kicks him in the stomach.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Do you have anything to say?

                          JULIAN
           I'm sorry...
          Chang kicks him again - like you would kick a dog... Juilan groans.
          Chang squats down next to him.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           What do you expect me to do?

                          JULIAN
           I don't know... I'm sorry.
          Chang gets up and walks on. He stops and turns round.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Come on.
          Julian stumbles to his feet. The party continue. We see that one
          of the crew is carrying an axe.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. FIELD / HIGH POINT - DAWN

          A couple of wild dogs watch as our group reach a high point.
          Chang looks down at Julian who is lying on the ground. The crew
          stand in the background with Mai.
          Chang sits next to Julian.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           When you were born - what's the first
           thing you remember seeing?
          A beat as Julian struggles to understand Chang's question... Chang
          stares at him.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           What do you remember?
          Beat.

                          JULIAN
           Dark... Darkness.
          Chang looks at him in a strange way - like this answer has some
          meaning for him.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           And do you ever see light?
          Julian shakes he's head.

                          JULIAN
           No... Never.
          Chang considers this answer for a long moment. He gets up and
          returns to Mai - stares at her....

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           I am the Angel of Vengeance... I restore
           order and karma. I love all living
           things...
          Mai just stares at him - too frightened to move.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           ...I want you to walk away from here
           now... Do you understand?
          Mai nods.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           Good.
          Chang smiles at her.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           Go with God.
          Mai turns and leaves. Chang watches her disappear into the field.
          Chang takes the axe off Phaiban and turns back to Julian.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. FIELD - DAWN

          Mai walks through the field, alone.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. FIELD / HIGH POINT - DAWN

          Chang leans down next to Julian and whispers something into
          Julian's ear - so softly that we cannot hear it. Whatever it says
          it instantly has an effect on Julian. He visibly relaxes.
          He doesn't make a sound as he's held down. A plastic strap is
          tied around his arm as a tourniquet. His arm is pulled out.
          Chang swings the axe and chops off first his left hand and then
          his right.
          Julian grits his teeth throughout. Doesn't scream.
          Chang picks up the severed hands and throws them to the wild dogs.
          The dogs tear into the meat, fighting over their prize.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. FIELD - DAWN

          Chang and his men walk back towards the car.
          MUSIC KICKS IN once again... the Karaoke version of John Denver's
          country and western ballad...

           CHANG (V.O.)
           Almost heaven, West Virginia
           Blue ridge mountains
           Shenandoah river -
           Life is old there
           Older than the trees
           Younger than the mountains
           Growin' like the breeze.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. BANGKOK - DAY

          We see various scenes of every day life in Bangkok.

           CHANG (V.O.)
           Country roads, take me home
           To the place I belong
           West Virginia, mountain momma
           Take me home, country roads

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

          We see kids waiting outside the school for their parents to pick
          them up. Kanita spots Chang, runs towards him and they embrace.

           CHANG (V.O.)
           All my memories gathered round her
           Miners lady, stranger to blue water
           Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
           Misty taste of moonshine
           Teardrops in my eye.
          Chang and Kanita disappear into a crowd of policemen.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT

          Chang is in his element. Singing like a cowboy.

                          CHANG
           Country roads, take me home
           to the place I belong

           Take me home, country roads..
          The Cops sit and watch him. Their leader... Their God...

                          CUT TO:

          INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

          Julian is lying in hospital. Bandages covering the terrible wounds
          where his hands once were.
          Mai is sitting beside him. Spoon feeding him food.

           CHANG (V.O.)
           I hear my voice
           In the mornin' hour she calls me
           The radio reminds me of my home far away
           And drivin' down the road I get a feelin'
           That I should have been home yesterday,

                          YESTERDAY

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. HEATHROW AIRPORT - DAY

          An aeroplane lands.

           CHANG (V.O.)

          INT. CUSTOMS - DAY

          Jenna is in the process of being strip searched by the authorities.
          Zero dignity.

           CHANG (V.O.)
           West Virginia, mountain momma
           Take me home, country roads
          As one of the Custom's Officers puts on a rubber glove, Jenna
          starts to scream out obscenities at them. Mask off, a real monster
          underneath, flailing around for all to see.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT

          Chang keeps singing.

                          CHANG
           Country roads, take me home
           to the place I belong
           West Virginia, mountain momma
           Take me home, country roads
           Take me home, country roads
           Take me home, country roads

          And we end CLOSE on Chang. With the sense that the 'country roads'
          have kind of taken both of them home...

              Small beautiful country town in the fall, on the shore of a

              Students' choir rehearsing Canon in D by Pachelbel (not
              originally written with lyrics). Among many, Conrad is
              singing. He is just behind Jeannine Pratt. They don't know
              each other yet.

              A man of fifty is holding his wife's hand over the breakfast
              table.

              Laughter again. The man and the woman are two actors on stage
              of the local theater. A very conventional play. The set
              represents an average American kitchen. A man and a woman are
              having coffee. Man is holding woman's hand.
          
              We gradually discover the audience of the theater.

                           So I don't know everything about
                           you. I don't know your favorite
                           movie stars. I can't remember the
                           name of your favorite perfume. I
                           have racked my brain and I can't
                           remember.

              Audience laughs, Alvin wakes up and behaves. Gives a
              conventional smile to his wife Beth.

                            pass you on... breathing in that

                            Why did you tell Annie Marshall
                            that Conrad is seeing a
                            psychiatrist?

                            I dunno. Why not?

                            Well for one thing, I don't think
                            people hear that kind of thing very
                            easily.

                            status symbol, right up there with
                            going to Europe.

                            Well, I thought your blurting it
                            out like that was in very bad
                            taste...

                            I did not think it was that...

                            I think it is a very private
                            matter.

                            believe in dreams. Only sometimes I

                            you're awake. Come on, something's

               Conrad is sitting, reflecting. A young woman's hand blinds
               him for a second : Karen has arrived.

                            be able to stay a real long time.
                            I've got a meeting over at school.
                            Drama Club meeting. We're doing "A
                            Thousand Clowns" this year. You
                            know it? Anyway. We're going so
                            crazy trying to get it together.
                            I am secretary this year too.

                            I didn't know quite what to
                            expect, though... I mean, you
                            sounded...uh, you sounded sort of
                            funny on the phone.

                            a name, and I went for a while. But
                            uh... I dunno.It just didn't work
                            for me, I guess. He just kept
                            telling me all the things I already
                            knew, and , uh... finally, I

                            help me is myself. At least, that's
                            what my dad says.
                            I don't mean it's not right for
                            you, Conrad. I mean I think that
                            if it's something you want to do,
                            that's what you should be doing.

                            Boy?
          
                                      DR BERGER
                            Yeah. What about him?

                            My father came into my room and he
                            didn't know what to say.
                            This is right after Buck died.
                            And he came over and sat on the
                            bed next to me, put his arm
                            around my shoulder. We just sat
                            there.
                            I remember I was watching his
                            shoe.
                            And thinking...
                            Cos his shoe was turned over on
                            its side.
                            I was thinking: "He's so uptight,
                            it's gonna crack off."
          
               Dr Berger listens carefully.

                            And I knew I should have felt
                            something.
                            But I didn't know what to feel.
                            I kept thinking what they say on
                            TV, you know, stuff like:

                            But I didn't say that... because
                            I didn't feel sad...
                            so much as...
          
               Conrad sighs.

                            I dunno. I kept thinking that John
                            Boy would've said something...about
                            the way he felt, you know.
                            Something.

                            Come on.
          
               Conrad seems lost. Dr Berger is on to something.

               Calvin walks with his business partner Ray Hanley (seen at
               the party).

                            Well. At least she's an
                            improvement. She doesn't crack gum
                            in your face. That's what you get
                            when your partner does the hiring
                            and firing.
          
                                      CALVIN
                            Oh, I'm sorry. That's my fault.
                            I just can never seem to tell
                            anybody that they're not making

                            That's not the problem.
                            Where are you?

                            That's okay. That's okay. You off

                            Come on. I've known you for twenty
                            years. You think I can't tell when
                            something's wrong? How's Connie?

                            Look, I am sorry, it's none of my
                            business, but I think you worry too
                            much. You've been on the rack about
                            him long enough. You're making it a
                            habit. You've gotta let him go
                            sometime.

                            I'm not on the rack about him.

                            The thing about it is, in a year
                            he'll be gone. Off to Michigan or
                            Harvard or wherever in the hell he
                            gets it in his head he wants to go.
                            Maybe he'll decide to take a tour
                            of Europe for a year and not even
                            go to school at all. Who knows?

                            gone. Got her own friends, her own

                            of days on vacations, but... I don't
                            know, maybe girls are different.
                            Or maybe she was too aware of what
                            was happening between Nance and me.
                            But they leave... And all that
                            worrying doesn't amount to a hill

               heavily swimming in his lane, although he looks tired and
               bored, not really fit for training. He stops, exhausted at
               the end of a row, looks at his friends happily discussing
               by the side of the pool, then at coach Salan in his office
               glass booth overlooking the swimming pool. Conrad reflects.

                            about the whole thing. What I
                            said, I didn't mean it. Just please
                            tell her. Tell her I'm sorry, will
                            you?

                            She was upset, Conrad. Your mother
                            was hurt because you quit the swim
                            team. I don't understand it myself.

                            I don't mean just now. Don't you
                            see? I don't mean just today.

                            What about this Dr. Berger? Do you

                                      DR BERGER
                            Tuesday you felt great. You bought
                            a Christmas tree, it was all hunky-
                            dory. Okay?
          
                                      CONRAD
                            You're the doctor.

                            Don't take refuge in one-liners
                            like "You're the doctor". Okay?
                            Because that pisses me off.
          
                                      CONRAD
                            Okay. Okay.
          
                                      DR BERGER
                            So everything was fine till you had
                            the fight with your mother, then
                            everything was lousy.
          
                                      CONRAD
                            Yeah, but I don't blame her. I
                            mean, she's got... She's got her
                            reasons. It's impossible after all
                            the shit I've pulled!
          
                                      DR BERGER
                            What shit have you pulled? Hey!
                            Remember! I'm talking proportion
                            here. Now, what shit?
          
               Conrad sighs.

                            up with at least one example.
                            And don't give me "I tried to
                            kill myself", that's old turkey.

                            I'm never gonna be forgiven for
                            that. Never! You know, you can't
                            get it out, you know, all the blood
                            in her towels, in her rug.
                            Everything had to be pitched.
                            Even the tiles in the bathroom
                            had to be regrouted. Christ, she
                            fired the godamn maid because she
                            couldn't dust the living room
                            right. If you think I'm gonna
                            forgive... - that she's gonna
                            forgive me...
          
               Conrad stops. Dr. Berger looks at Conrad to signal him he
               just said something: Conrad realizes he just made a Freudian
               slip, looks at him,

                            What?
          
               Conrad stands up, reflects, looks outside window.

                            because you're unlovable. Where
                            does that leave your dad? How come
                            he loves you? You're a rottenkid,

                            wrong.
                            Look... maybe she just can't

                            to. Maybe she's just afraid to

               Calvin and Friend are jogging in sportswear. Calvin's friend
               explains a stock market deal he made.

                            Say. After going to a new high, it
                            falls to 112 1/4 and then rallies
                            on good volume. I shoot an order to
                            buy 4000 at the market. If I get
                            the 4000 shares at 113 3/4, I know
                            something's wrong.

                            But suppose the order to buy the
                            4000 shares I put in at the price
                            of 113 3/4, I get 2000 at 114, 500
                            at 114 1/4, and the rest on the way
                            up, so the last 500 shares I pay
                            115 1/2, then I know I'm right.I'm
                            going to peel off here.

                            In the car, I was thinking: "be
                            clear.". I suppose that's what
                            psychiatry's about. Being precise
                            and clear. And honest, of course.
                            I'll level with you. I'm not a
                            great believer in psychiatry.

                            between you and him, and...I like
                            that, I respect that.
                            And...he's better, I can see
                            that. I am not trying to put you
                            down, I just don't believe in
                            psychiatry as a panacea for
                            everybody.

                            I don't know actually, I'm not
                            sure, I think I meant in terms of
                            Conrad. You see, I knew something
                            was wrong even before he tried
                            to... to kill himself. But I
                            thought that... It's clear that
                            he's very smart. He's been an "A"
                            student ever since he started
                            school, and naturally I thought
                            that ...intelligent people could
                            work out their own problems.

                            It was luck. It was just luck
                            that I happened to be there when
                            he tried it. I could have been at
                            a meeting. We both could've been
                            away. It was luck!

                            You think of yourself as a lucky

                            No! No. No. I used to. I used to
                            think... that I was a lucky person...
                            before... the "accident".
                            Mmm, I guess the whole of life is
                            nothing but an accident, is it?
                            What happens to you. I should do

                            That sounds more like the
                            philosophy of a drifter than a tax

                            little. I can see myself, ...and I
                            can see the two of them drifting
                            away from me, and I just stand

                            Yeah... No. I don't know. I see her
                            not being able to forgive him.

                            much like her. People always think
                            that she and Buck are... were
                            ...were alike. But it's really she
                            and Conrad. They were the only two
                            that didn't cry at the funeral, you
                            know? It's not easy for me to admit
                            this but, uh... she didn't...
                            His mother doesn't show him a
                            great deal of affection. I'm not

                            at all. She is a wonderful woman,

                            she felt for him was special. You
                            know, he was her first-born.

                            Mmm. She's very... No. There's no
                            problem with her for me. We've
                            been... We've been married nearly

                            it's been difficult. He didn't talk

                            happens here. It doesn't come up. I

               Beth and Conrad are having lunch at a table in the diner.
               Beth is summing up the birthday presents she bought.

                            something for my mother and father.
                            He's not supposed to get
                            something for his doctor, is he?

                            Can't break the ball, can't break
                            the floor, can't break anything in
                            a bowling alley. And that's what I
                            like about bowling alleys. Can't
                            even break the record.

               Golf ball being wished out of sight by a club. Beth, Calvin,
               Ward (Beth's brother) and his wife Audrey, are having drinks
               sitting at a table on a golf course under a parasol.
          
               WARD lifts his golf club and demonstrates a clumsy hesitating
               swing, and how it misses.

               Ward arms his club as if to strike, then stops.

               Revolver fires upwards. Swimmers dive. It's a swimming
               competition. Conrad is sitting on one of the top bleachers,
               fully dressed, uneasy, while down there, by the side of the
               pool, his friends, in swimming trunks and wet hair, watch the
               race. Lazenby sees him, Conrad looks down. In the audience,
               everyone is shouting for his team.
          
               .../...
          
               Now the competition is finished. The swimming pool is empty
               and silent, except for someone sweeping the side of the pool,
               and Conrad sitting still, reflecting, looking around.

               Lazenby tries to stop him. Conrad pushes him away. Two

               Conrad gets home, climbs upstairs directly to his room, and
               closes the door. His grandmother hears him, opens her bedroom

                          Why'd you let go?
          
                                    DR BERGER
                          Because I got tired!

                          It hurts to be mad at him, doesn't
                          it?

                          Yeah. He just wasn't careful. He
                          just wouldn't care. He didn't see
                          how a bad thing might happen.

                Jeannine opens her curtains, sees Conrad, outside her home,
                walking to and fro. She puts on a jacket and comes out to
                him.

                             Hi. I was gonna call but I didn't
                             want to wake anyone.
          
                                       JEANNINE
                             Might have been easier...

                             Listen, I want to say something
                             about the other night. I mean I
                             liked being with you but I didn't
                             like myself.
          
                                       JEANNINE
                             Conrad. I was stupid.
                             That was dumb of me to laugh and
                             it was my fault. I just didn't
                             know what to do. I was
                             embarrassed.
          
                                        CONRAD
                             Really?   You were embarrassed?
          
                                       JEANNINE
                             Yes. When those boys came in, it
                             was awful and awkward. That's what
                             I do when I get embarrassed. I
                             laugh.
          
                                       CONRAD
                             But they were all right. They were
                             just up and they were having a good
                             time, and I let them get in the way
                             of what was happening. It was dumb.
                             It was dumb. I've been doing lots
                             of dumb things lately. I just
                             didn't know wether or not you were
                             being straight with me.

                             Anyway, I'd like to try it again. I
                             thought it worked out okay. Well,
                             except for the bowling.
          
                Jeannine laughs, looks down, then looks up straight in his
                eyes.

                Conrad realizes. Laughs.

                             exam? Well, I can't do it! I

                             with no questions, and you can't do

                             make sure that your kids are good

                             You are beautiful. And you are
                             unpredictable. But you're so
                             cautious. You're determined, Beth.
                             But you know something? You're not
                             strong. And I don't know if you're
                             really giving. Beth is looking at

                             But you can't handle mess.
                             You need everything neat and
                             ...easy.
                             I don't know. Maybe you can't
                             love anybody. It was so much
                             Buck. And Buck died, it was as if
                             you buried all your love with
                             him, and I don't understand that.
                             I just don't know.

                             Maybe, finally, it was the best
                             of you that you buried.

                             So I was crying.

                             't know if I love you anymore. And

                             without that.
          
                Beth does not know what to say or do. She turns away and goes

                Beth enters, kind of reflects, then goes open a closet, takes
                out some luggage. A sudden burst of emotion overcomes her,
                she cries but does not seem to identify the emotion, then
                restrains it.

                In his bed Conrad is not sleeping. He hears the door of the
                house close, then someone walking outside on the gravel. He
                gets up, go look out of the window. Ouside, a taxi leaves. He
                goes downstairs.

                From inside, Conrad finally sees his father in the garden,
                reflecting. Patches of snow. Conrad puts on his coat over
                his pyjamas, and joins him.

          FADE IN:
          CLOSE -- KATE COLEMAN (MID 30S )
          She's a simple beauty and very pregnant, propped up in a bed,
          wearing a hospital gown. A heart rate monitor BEEPS. She touches
          her swollen belly, flush with excitement, her eyes full of wonder.

          MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Okayp, just relax.now. This'll be over
          Caitti before you know it.
          Kate looks up. Her smile falters-as we REVEAL:

          INT. DELIVERY ROOM - NIGHT

          Harsh lights overhead. -THUNDER rumbles outside. Kate's on a.
          delivery table, legs already in the stirrups. A sheet hangs-  
          across her belly so we can't see what's going on below her waist.
          A DOCTOR and NURSE snap pn gloves, prepare instruments: SHARP
          BLADES and CURETTES, NEEDLES and FORCEPS. Kate is stricken. She
          tries to sit up.

          KATE
          Wait, I've changed my mind. I don't
          want to do this anymore.
          The Doctor gives the Nurse an exasperated look. The Nurse takes
          Rate's hand, eases her back onto the table.

          NURSE
          Your baby is dead. There's nothing.
          else we can do.
          Kate reels, her world turned upside-dowp. Emotional free-fall.

          KATE
          No, this isn't what's supposed to
          happen. My baby's alive!

          NURSE
          We're so sorry. A terrible loss, we're
          so sorry...

          KATE
          But it's still alive! It's moving!
          Feel it, you can feel it!
          Kate tries to put the Nurse's hand on her.belly but the-Nurse-
          pulls away and hands the Doctor a pair of gleaming.blunt-tipped
          SURGICAL SCISSORS. The Doctor leans between Rate's spread legs,
          disappearing behind the curtain. Rate gasps.

          RATE
          No, stop! I want to be asleep! 
          

          

          2.

          -DOCTOR-
          TOO late for anesthesia.'' The baby's
          coming. You're.going to experience
          some pressure now... -
          Kate winces and bites her lip as the Doctor goes about his unseen
          work. A GOOD-LOOKING MAN in surgical scrubs stands behind him..
          Bizarrely, he's videotaping-the whole thing. He's Kate's husband,
          JOHN (late 30's). He smiles at her from behind -the camera.

          JOHN
          It's okay, honeys You're doing great!
          The Doctor hands the scissors, now slick with gore, to the Nurse.
          H e takes a SUCTION. CATHETER and disappears behind-the curtain
          again. The Nurse - presses a button on a vacuum pump and the
          machine begins to HUM. Kate tightly closes her eyes.

          KATE
          This isn't happening. Wake up, wake
          up, wake up...
          Suddenly -- the thin wail of a BABY CRYING. Rate's eyes go wide
          w ith horror as the smiling Nurse approaches with a wriggling
          bundle wrapped in a blanket. Blood seeps through the pink fabric.
          W e can't see what's inside, but it's moving. And it's CRYING.

          NURSE
          Congratulations, Mrs. Coleman. It's a
          girl .
          The Nurse offers her the bloody, blanketed bundle. Kate screams -

          INT. KATE AND JOHN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          -- then snaps awake. She's been having a nightmare. John lies
          n ext to her in bed. Be stirs, but doesn't wake. Kate slips out
          of bed and quickly pads to the bathroom;

          INT. KATE AND JOHN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Kate closes the door. We now see that she's not pregnant in
          reality, only in her nightmare. She slides to the cold floor in
          t he dark, a hand on her flat belly as she starts to cry...

          INT. DOCTOR BROWNING'S OFFICE - DAY

          Water TRICKLES in a little Zen fountain. Kate sits across from
          -DR. -BROWNING, a mousy-haired woman in her 50's.

          DR. BROWNING
          A lot of women experience difficulties
          around the anniversary of the
          miscarriage or the baby's expected due
          date. It's perfectly normal.

          

          

          

          

          3.

          KATE
          I was thinking of" going back to work.
          I really thought 1 was doing better.

          DR. BROWNING
          You are. Think about where you were
          just four months ago. -
          (off Kate's look)
          Are you still sober?
          Kate hesitates. Dr. Browning gives her a penetrating look.

          KATE
          I drove by the wine shop,on my.way.bome
          the other day.

          DR. BROWNING
          Did you stop?

          KATE
          I really wanted to. The thought went
          through m' head, you know. it wasn't
          for me, it just might be nice to have a
          bottle handy in case we had guests.

          DR. BROWNING.
          But you didn't go in?

          KATE
          No.

          DR. BROWNING
          That's all that matters. Let's try to
          stay focused on the. positive. Grief is
          different for everyone. You have to
          take it at your own pace.. Keep writing
          in your journal. You're doing fine.
          Rate smiles weakly. unconvinced.

          INT. LIVING ROOM -.DAY

          Rate hangs curtains over a beautiful picture window. She steps'
          back to admire her work, then sighs. Now what? Now that she s
          done, the house suddenly seems-quiet and lonely and too big.

          INT. NURSERY - DAY

          Kate sits in a rocking chair, gazing out a distinctive ARCHED
          'WINDOW. We realize that she's -In a fully furnished and decorated
          nursery. Crib, changing table, baby swing. No baby.

          EXT. COLEMAN RESIDENCE - DAY

          It's a big, dramatic home in an affluent neighborhood. Kate
          % crosses the backyard into the nearby woods.

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          After a short walk, Kate sits by a PEACEFUL BROOK lost in her
          thoughts. ,She pulls a JOURNAL filled. with handwritten entries
          from her coat pocket. After a beat,'she begins to write.

          EXT. SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF - DAY

          Class has just let out, PARENTS arriving to pick up their KIDS.
          But the playground is MOSTLY SILENT -- these children an deaf,
          communicating to one another and their teachers by sign language.

          Kate kisses Max's'head and helps her into the van, buckling her
          car seat. Max shows her an art project she's bringing home.

          crosses the street in front of them and stops at the corner. Kate
          watches her for a long beat as if transfixed...
          In the backseat, Max-CLAPS her hands to get Kate's attention.
          Kate turns and sees Max pointing to the traffic light. IVs

          Kate sits at a baby grand piano,'trying to compose a piece of..
          music. She plays a few NOTES, frowns, tries again, takes a pencil
          and erases what she's written down.
          She pauses to look over-at a beautiful ORCHID in an ornate plants=
          by the window. For a moment, she just stares at it. Then:
          13 1 She's startled by something outside BOUNCING off the side

          Max is playing basketball in the driveway, but the ball's too big
          for her and the hoop's too.high. Every time she tries to shoot,
          the ball falls short and BANGS against the house.

          Kate opens-the door, angrily signing as she speaks:
          Stop banging that against the house!
          I'm trying-to work!.

          MAX

          SORRY.
          Max gives an abashed look. Kate sighs. She knows she was too
          harsh with her.

          KATE
          -No, I'm sorry.. But just... take a
          break for a little while, okay?
          Max nods. Kate goes. back inside.
          A CAR pulls into the-drive.. It's John and eleven--year-old-DANIEL,
          Rate and John's other child. Daniel's blonde, brash, and-cocky,
          the all-American kid. He's wearing.a Little League uniform.
          Daniel runs toward Max. He steals her ball and dribbles-it around
          her in circles. -Max watches glumly. He offers her the ball, but
          when she reaches for it, he snatches it away and shoots a lay--up..-

          DANIEL
          Boo -yahl He shoots! He scores!

           

          JOHN
          Nice one, champ! -
          Daniel pumps his arm and runs inside. John walks up the drive,
          carrying a bouquet of FLOWERS. He hands Max the ball and lifts
          her up to the basket. Max happily puts the ball-through'the hoop.

          JOHN
          All right! Ginme five!
          She smiles and gives him a high-five as he carries her inside.

          YN'. MUSIC ROOM - DAY -
          Kate has just sat back down at the piano when she hears Daniel
          tear into the house and run upstairs. She slumps her shoulders
          and closes her notebook. No more work today. John enters.

          JOHN

          Ore story. Then bedtime. Okay?
          Max nods. happily and picks up a book from her nightstand. Kate
          groans inwardly when she sees what it is. It'.s called. "We were
          Going To Have A Baby, .But We Had An Angel Instead."

          KATE
          You want to hear about the baby again?

          Kate sits on Max's bed, reading and showing her the pictures:

          KATE
          "People send us flowers and cards, but
          we still miss our baby. If this just
          happened to you, I'm sorry you got an
          angel instead of a'baby. I.think a
          baby would have been more fun."
          The last picture is a FAMILY WITH A BABY ANGEL watching over them.

          MAX

          IS BABY JESSIE AN ANGEL?

          KATE

          her back. Kate freezes. He can't see the-nervous look that
          crosses her face. He moves closer, pushes her hair aside, kissing
          hex-. neck. Kate responds stiffly, trying to get. in the mood.
          He slides a hand around her waist, moves it up to her breast...

          KATE
          I'm sorry. I can't. Shit...
          She moves away, tears suddenly in.her eyes. He gives a concerned
          look, lets her have her space. A beat.

            KATE
          I'm so sick of feeling like this.
          Christ, the kids must thing I'm crazy.

          JOHN
          Will you stop worrying about what
          everybody else thinks?

          KATE
          How can I? I saw a pregnant woman
          today on the way home and I almost lost
          it. Just burst into tears with Max
          sitting right there. Daniel barely
          talks to me. You and I haven't had sex
          in over a year now. What if I.never
          get better? I don't want to lose you.

          JOHN
          You're never going to lose us. I
          promise you. I just wish...
          (off her look)
          Have you thought any more about
          adopting?

          KATE
          I can't even be a mother to the
          children we already have.

          JOHN
          That's not true. The kids understand.
          They just know you're not happy.

          KATE  
          But I should be.

          JOHN -
          Do you want another child?

          

          

          

          

          B.

          KATE
          You Snow I do. More than anything.

          JOHN

          KATE-

          YES

          JOHN
          Then what are we talking about this
          -for? Let's do it.

          KATE
          You-don't just adopt a child because
          you're lonely and depressed.

          JOHN
          That's not why we'd be doing..it. We
          wanted a child a year ago and we still
          want one, now..

          KATE
          We can't replace our baby.

          JOHN
          No, 'we can't. But we can take the'
          place we made for her in our hearts and
          our home and give it to a child who
          needs a family.

          (BEAT)
          Kate, we love being parents. We're
          good at it and'it makes. us happy. What
          better reason-do you want?
          Kate looks at him for a beat, then smiles and lets her tears fall.

          from a big-window, shining on A LITTLE GIRL in a lacy white dress.
          Her. back is to us, so.we can't see her face, just curls of
          platinum blonde hair spilling to her shoulders. She sits at an
          easel, all alone, painting another extraordinary picture.
          John watches, curious. Suddenly; she senses his presence. She-
          stops humming, the paintbrush freezes mid-stroke. She turns.
          She looks about eight years old, with pale skin and-bright, doe-
          like eyes, her delicate features framed by Shirley Temple curls.
          It's the face- of a porcelain angel, a perfect little laving doll,
          friendly and inviting. She wears a thick black velvet ribbon
          around her neck and one around each wrist. Her'name is ESTHER.

          Hi there.

           ESTHER
          Hello. -
          She speaks with a strange accent. Sounds Eastern European.

          JOHN
          Are these , paintings all yours?

          John. It's nice to meet you.
          She smiles and demurely offers her hand, giggling as he takes it.
          She blushes, then turns back to her painting. It's a half-
          finished jungle scene with a SMILING LION crouched beneath a tree.

          JOHN
          So what's this one going to bo? 

          ESTHER
          My paintings are stories that come from
          my imagination. -This one'-s about a'sad
          mother lion who can't find her cube.

          She will. I,bok.
          As she speaks, Esther dabs her brush and paints little lion cubs
          curled up in front of their sleeping mother:

          ESTHER
          They were lost'in the jungle 'and they
          were so scared because they didn't'have
          a mother or father. But just when they
          thought they'd be alone forever, they
          found their mother sleeping under this
          tree. And they felt so safe that they
          fell asleep too. Now when-the mother
          lion wakes up, her dream will have come
          true. She has her family again.

          JOHN
          Where did you learn how to do this?

          ESTHER
           Y've just had lots of time to practice,
          I guess. It's so boring here.

          JOAN

          not, but it isn't true. I don't care.
          If I'm sad or lonely, I just come in
          here a nd paint a story with a happy
          endingg And when people say they like.
          my paintings, it makes me feel better.
          (off his look)
          I think.peo le should always try to
          take the bad things that happen to them
          and turn them into something good.
          Don't you?
          John is taken aback. Who j t1m1s )dc? Before he can respond:

          .- RATE (O.S.)
          There you are.
          Rate and Sister Abigail stand in the doorway. John waves for Kate
          to enter and Esther sits up eagerly when she does. Abigail's
          expression darkens when she sees who John has been talking to.

          JOHN
          Hey, I'd like you to meet someone. -
          (to Esther).
          Esther, this is my wife, Kate.
          Kate smiles and offers her hand, but instead of shaking it, Esther
          lovingly presses it to her cheek.

          

          

          

          

          14. -

          ESTIIR -
          Motta...
          Kate'and John exchange a beumsed look'.

          JOHN
          She painted these all by herself.

          ' RATE
          Wow, you're quite the little-artist.

          ESTHE'R
          Thank you. You smell nice.
          Kate laughs. Sister Abigail shifts uncomfortably.

          ESTHER
          Would you like me to paint you a
          picture? You can watch me if-you want.
          I'm normally a little shy, but --

          SISTER ABIGAIL'
          Esther, I'm sorry, they don't have time
          for you to paint them a picture.
          (off Esther's look)
          They have to come with me now.
          Yolanda's going home with them
          tomorrow. isn't that wonderful?
          Esther wilts. She releases Rate's hand and musters a weak smile.

          ESTHER
          Yes. I'm sure she'll be very happy.

          KATE
          It was nice meeting you.

          ESTHER -
          The pleasure was mine.

          JOHN
          (to Sister Abigail)
          You've got a real talent on your hands
          here.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          Yes, we're very lucky to have her.
          But there's something -strange-in Abigail's voice -- she definitely
          doesn't un -lucky. Esther watches them go.

          INT. HOME FOR GIRLS - ENTRY - DAY

          Sister Abigail walks Kate and John to the front door.

          

          

          

          

          I5.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          The notary will be here at.ten for-you-
          to sign the placement agreement.

          KATE
          Thank you so much for all your help.
          Kate gives her a warm hug. But mid-embrace, she notices
          something: Esther is at the end of the hallway, peering at them
          from around a corner. Abigail and John see--her,' too.

          KATE
          What did she say to me.back there? It
          sounded like... "motta?"

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          It's Russian. It means "mother."
          INT.JoHN'S CAR - NIGHT
          John whistles "Whatever Will Be, Will Be" to himself as he drives.
          Kate gives him an amused look, then Jokingly sings along:

          KATE -
          When you were juuust a liuittle

          JOHN
          Sorry, I've got that stuck in my head
          now.

          KATE
          She. made quite an impression on.you.

          JOHN
          I wish you co'uld've heard the things.
          she was saying before you c&me in. I
          Jatow adults who aren't that mature.

          (BEAT)
          I wonder' why they didn't show us her
          case file.

          KATE
          She probably wasn't there when we were
          first ,looking.

          JOHN
          It just blows may mind, a kid could go
          through as much-as she must have and
          still turn out like that.

          KATE
          You sound like you're sorry we're not
          adopting her instead of Yolanda.

          

          

          

          

          16.

          JOHN
          No, of course not. I just hope she.
          gets the right break.
          (off her look)
          I wouldn't trade our littl'e' girl for
          the world. You )maw that.
          Rate gives him an adoring look and squeezes his hand.

          EXT. HOME FOR GIRLS - ESTABLISHING - MORNING .

          The sun is just rising,.warming the sky with an idyllic light.

          INT. HOME FOR GIRLS - DORMITORY.- MORNING

          The GIRLS (5-7) are busily getting dressed and making their beds.
          The HOUSEMOTHER inspects each of-them in turn. One bed remains
          unmade, its occupant missing. The Housemother turns to the room,
          ready to give a scolding, but can't find who she's looking for:

          HOUSEMOTHER
          Where's Yolanda?

          INT. HOME FOR GIRLS - WASHROOM - MORNING

          The OLDER GIRLS (8-12) are-brushing their teeth and washing up.
          The Housemother enters and looks around.

          HOUSEMOTHER
          Have any of you seen-Yolanda?
          Nobody has.

          INT. HOME FOR GIRLS -- VARIOUS - MORNING

          Sister Abigail leads the NUNS and LAY ASSISTANTS in a search of
          the home, looking for Yolanda. The playroom, art room, chapel,
          classrooms, laundry room, rest rooms.-- they're all empty.

          INT. HOME FOR GIRLS - BASEMENT - MORNING

          A young-nun, SISTER JUDITH, walks downstairs into -a dark storage-
          area. Lots of hiding places. -

          SISTER JUDITH
          Yolanda? Are you hiding-down here?
          Then she notices a closet behind her. The door. is ajar. She
          reaches out, opens it... and nearly gags at what she sees inside.

          LOW ANGIL - INSIDE THE CLOSET
           A child's bare feet dangle in mi , , a .,im3. The "Travel Turtle" is on
          the floor beneath them. - A chair lies on its side nearby.

          

          

          

          

          17.

          INT. HOTEL ROOM -- MORNING -

          Kate dries her' hair in the bathroom. The PHONE RINGS O.S. She
          pauses, suddenly concerned for some reason. She opens the door.
          As John reaches for-the phone, CAMERA MOVES IN on Kate. She
          watches from the doorway, her  face already registering dread. She
          knows. Even before he answers the phone, somehow she knows.

          JOHN (0,S-)
          Bello?

          EXT. HOTEL ROOM BALCONY - DAY

          The sky has turned gray. Kate stares out at the hotel parking-
          lot, smoking a cigarette.  - Her eyes are red;- but she's long since
          cried-herself out. John stands by the open-sliding glass door.

          JOHN
          .The birth family is claiming her body.
          They're planning a private service.
          He looks to Kate for a reaction, but she has none. He continues:

          JOHN
          Sister Abigail thinks she might have
          been playing something called "The
          Choking Game." It's a kind of
          schoolyard dare. You try to get a rush
          by having someone choke you until you
          almost pass out. There have been cases
          where kids have tried it alone and
          accidentally hanged themselves.
          A beat. Kate's voice is distant, as;

          KATE
          So that's it? She just vanishes from
          our lives?

          JOHN
          We can have our awn-service. I think
          .it's important that we -

          KATE
          I've been' in grief counseling for
          almost a year-and-a-half.. If you say
          the word "closure,." I'm going to-claw
          your eyes out.
          She's not angry, just matter-of-fact. Be wants to say something,
          but holds his tongue. Silence hangs heavy between them.

          KATE
          Maybe we're not supposed.to do this.

          

          

          

          

          18.

          - JOHN..
          No. Don't say that. -

          RATE- -
          we -try to .have a baby and I have a
          'third-trimester miscarriage that leaves.
          me sterile. 'We try to adopt and she
          dies the night before we bring her
          home. That doesn't sound like'
          somebody's trying to tell us. something?

          JOHN   -
          Yolanda didn' t the to.teach us a
          lesson.. We didn't make this-happen.

          KATE '
          It doesn't make.anndifference. I
          can't go through this again.

          JOHN
          so let's not. Let's adopt.Bather.
          This brings Kate back to reality. She eyes him coolly.

          KATE
          Her body's barely cold and you're
          already thinking about replacing her?

          JOHN .
          We can't replace Yolanda any more than
          We can replace Jessie. But we can't
          help her anymore, either. Esther is
          alive and needs a family. Right now.

          KATE
          We have to at least wait until.--

          JOHN
          -Until what? I don't want to waste
          .a nother year of our lives wishing for
          something that we.can't-have.
          (beat).
          I want us to feel like a family again.
          Kate regards him for a beat, conflicted. Then:

          KATE
          Let's see what Sister Abigail thinks.

          INT. HOME FOR GIRLS - SISTER ABIGAIL'S OFFICE - DAY -

          Sister Abigail hands Rate and John a folder with a Polaroid of
          Esther stapled to it. Her- case file.

          

          

          

          

          19.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          For the most -part, she's an'ideal
          child. She's originally from Russia,
          but her English is flawless, Smart as
          a.tvhip and very mature Â°for her age. I
          don't think I've-ever had to tell her
          .anything-twice and I've never had to
          clean-up after her.. She's a bit of a-
          nQat-freak.

          JOHN
          I think we can handle that.

          SISTER.ABIGAIL
          She's also fiercely independent.,
          Whatever the other-children want to do,
          she wants to.dc the opposite.

          JOHN
          She told me they make fun of her.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          I'm sure they do, but she doesn't make-
          things any easier on herself. She just
          doesn't seem interested in friends..
          She doesn't even play like a normal
          child. She just reads and paints.
          Most of the time she barely-speaks.

            KATE  
          Why do'you think that is?

          SISTER ABIGAIL .
          Well, like most of the girls here,
          there's been no shortage of hardship in
          her life.- She's been orphaned twice--
          her birthmother died of AIDS, then the
          American family who adopted her was-
          killed in.a house fire. And I strongly
          suspect that she's been sexually abused
          as well.

          KATE
          By who?

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          I don't know. There's nothing in her
          -history, but that doesn't necessarily
          mean anything. Russian adoption -
          records. are notoriously unreliable.

          JOHN
          Then what are you basing this on?
          Sister Abigail hesitates. Deciding how much to say.

          

          

          

          

          20.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          I wish I knew. There's just something
          missing with her. A-spark you see in a
          child's eyes that isn't there. I've
          only seen that-before in cases where
          the child had been severely
          traumatized. It might also explain -
          some of her idiosyncratic behaviors.

          JOHN
          Like what?

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          She refuses to shower or change clothes
          with the other girls.' She won't even
          allow the housemother in-the bathroom
          with her. She.'.s also very concerned
          with her physical appearance for her
          age. She's like a teenager getting
          ready for a date every morning. She
          insists on wearing dresses-every day.
          The ribbons around her wrists and neck
          stay on day and night. . The only
          trouble we ever had with her was when
          we tried to take them off. She kicked
          two of Sister Francis' teeth-out.
          Kate and Tohn are taken. aback. Abigail sighs.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          I'm sorry. I'm 'not trying to
          discourage you. If you're serious,
          I'll do everything I can to-expedite
          the process, given the circumstances.

          (BEAT)
          My one reservation is..this. When-an
          adoption fails, it's usually because
          the parents didn't know what to expect.
          -And'in this case, I can't' tell you what
          to expect because the plain fact of the-
          matter is that-I don't knaw.

          INT: HOME FOR GIRLS - CHAPEL DAY
          Esther is happily-helping a NUN clean the sanctuary. Kate and
          John sit in a pew near the back of the empty chapel.

          KATE
          She really did open up with us, didn't
          she?

          JOHN
          She latched. right onto you. We're
          probably the best chance she has at a.
          normal life.
          Esther looks up from her work and waves at them. They wave back.

          

          

          

          

          21.

          KATE
          A normal life..' That sounds really
          good,',doesn't it? -
          She smiles. and takes John- .'s hand.

          EXT. HOME FOR GIRLS - DAY.

          CAXERA FOLLOWS Esther's feet, saddle shoes CLICKING on -the walk.
          Kate walks beside her, holding her hand. In Esther's free hand,
          she clutches a DOG-EARED BIBLE held together with a rubber band.
          Activity on the playground stops as the girls watch Esther leave.
          None of them look sorry to see her go. She ignores them.
          John puts.Esther's things ---- a small suitcase and her-paintings
          in the trunk of the car.. Sister-Abigail sees them off.-

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          If you ever need anything, please don't
          hesitate to call.
          Before Kate. can respond, Esther tugs on her arm.

          _ESTHER
          Come on! Let's-go)
          Kate laughingly lets Esther drag her away.

          Sister Abigail happily watches them go.. Rate and Esther smile and
          wave goodbye.' She'waves back... but once the car pulls out, her
          smile fades. She seems'vaguely troubled as they drive away...

          INT./EXT. JOHN'S CAR - DAY

          Headed for home. Kate is showing Esther some SIGN LANGUAGE.
          Esther makes the sign for each letter as she says it aloud:

          ESTHER

          E-S-T-

          KATE
          Put your thumb here.
          She makes the sign for 'T." Esther. sees her mistake, corrects it.

          ESTHER

          Esther smiles and practices=it a few times.- Outside, the LEAVES
          have turned color. Esther gazes out in-wonder. -

          ESTHER
          It's so beautiful, motta.

          KATE
          Sweetie, here we say "Mont" or. "mommy."

          ESTHER
          Kate and John exchange-a warm look.

          EXT. PRIVATE ROAD - DAY

          John's car turns at a GATE and drives down the road leading-to
          their private community. The secluded road winds through the
          forest and crosses the little BROOK we saw earlier.

          EXT. NEIGHBORBOOD' - DAY

          The Coleman's neighborhood 3.s surrounded by forest,-an upscale
          community of big houses and manicured lawns. A POSTMAN delivers
          the mail. A HISPANIC NANNY pushes a BABY in a stroller.
          GARDENERS tend someone's flowers. Esther
          -soaks it all in.

          EXT. COLEMAN RESIDENCE - DAY

          They pull into the driveway and get out. Esther's mouth
          practically hangs open at the sight of their beautiful house.
          The front door opens and Max runs out to meet them. Daniel
          appears in the doorway-with DORIS COLEMAN (arid-60's), their
          grandmother. Daniel stands aghast at the sight of the strange,
          pale girl with the Goldilocks curls and frilly white dress.

          DANIEL

          (SOFTLY)
          -Holy shit:..
          Max. runs straight into Kate's arms and gets a big hug.

          KATE
          Oh, we missed you so muchll
          Kate gives Max a kiss, then turns to Esther: Max hangs back, a
          little shy. Esther signs' to Max without speaking: -

          ESTHER

          HELLO, MAX. MY NAME IS ESTHER.
          Max gives Kate an excited smile.

          KATE

          Esther notices Man's hearing aid.

          EST-HER -
          What's that?

          KATE .
          That's a hearing aid. It helps her
          hear.a little so she can read lips.
          John gives Doris a Use on the cheek.

          Everything's so bigi
          As Esther moves on to the next room, Daniel hangs back and
          whispers to John, too loud:

          DANIEL
          Why is she dressed like that?

          JOHN
          Don't be rude.

          

          

          

          

          24.
          Esther overhears them, but pretends she didn't. Kate sees this-
          and tries to distract her. -

          KATE
          Would you like to see-your room?
          Esther smiles and nods eagerly. But on the way up the stairs, she
          eyes Daniel furtively, sizing him up...

          INT. ESTHER'S BEDROOM - DAY

          Kate pushes the door open and Esther enters. We recognize the

          been completely made over as a little girl's room, complete with a
          lacy white canopy bed covered with a mountain of STUFFED ANIMALS..

          Kate and John walk to their room, arms lovingly around each other.
          They close their door, leaving the hallway empty and dark. Then:

          Esther's_room, PUSHING IN'on the doorknob, lingering there fora
          long beat... Then we hear the lock CLICK shut.

          Kate and Esther are decorating. Esther pins up some of her  
          paintings. Kate spreads out a selection of wallpaper borders.

          KATE
          Okay, which one do you like?

          ESTHER
          These are for a'younger child. Did you
          pick them out for Yolanda?
          Kate is taken aback. She stammers for a beat.

          KATE
          I'm sorry. I'll take them back and
          pick some just for you.

          ESTHER
          It's all right. I rather like this
          one.
          Esther points out her.favorite and goes back to pinning up her
          paintings. Kate sighs. As she rolls up the samples, she notices
          the same Gothic mansion in several of Esther's older paintings.

          KATE
          '1s that a real place?

          ESTHER
          No. I just made it up. It's a haunted
          castle where a beautiful- princess was
          locked away. She waited so long and
          was so sad that she filled the moat
          with her tears, but then a handsome
          prince swam ,across it and rescued her.

          INS'. SHOPPING MALL - DAY
          Sliding doors open. Rate and the girls enter. Esther looks

          -Jeans are ugly.

          KATE
          But sweetie, you have to have something
          you can play outside in.

          INT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY

          Kate leads the girls through the mall, carrying BAGS of purchases.
          Something catches Esther's eye. She hangs back, distracted.
          It's a pet store. ' In the display is an aguarium filled with
          TROPICAL. FISH, their vibrant colors illuminated by a black light
          in the tank. Esther gazes in, nose practically against the glass.

          RATE
          You like fish?

          ESTHER

          KATE
          You should show her Hodgepodge when we
          get home.
          Max nods eagerly. Esther givee.them a curious look.

          Hodgepodge? What's that?

          INT. MAX'S 13EDROOM -- DAY

          HODGEPODGE is a hamster. Esther kneels in front of his cage for a

          KATE
          Max. takes care of him all bir herself.
          It's her big girl responsibility.

          ESTHER

          Sure. But you have to promise not to-

          Daddy is,here to hold him.

          ESTEER
          Why? -

          KATE
          Because he's very delicate and you
          could hurt him. Okay?
          Esther xiods. Kate scoops.flodgepodge up and kneels between the

          KATE
          Well, we'll get Esther settled, then
          I'll probably go back, to work.

          DORIS
          Oh, so you think.they'll take you back?
          Kate's eyes flicker with irritation.

          KATE
          I'm not talking about Yale. I'm going
          to teach piano lessons from home.

          DORIS

          you had at Yale. It's a. shame.

          quit because.I couldn't work anymore.

          KATE
          She's fine.
          Kate's pointedly not making eye contact with Doris now.

          DORIS
          Well, it's a shame that it took
          something like that for you to :get
          help, but I'm glad you did.
          Kate takes. the plate of food and leaves without looking at her.

          EXT. COLEMAN RESIDENCE - POOL - NIGHT -

          Dinner's over. Daniel has changed into swim trunks and SPLASHES
          around in the pool. Everyone else is gathered around Esther,
          who's opening a few small presents. She unwraps a BOOK OF SIGN
          LANGUAGE and gasps excitedly.

          ESTHER ,
          This is perfect! Thank you! Eiow do I
          say "thank you?"
          Kate shows her. Esther turns and makes the sign to Max.

          MAX

          YOU'RE WELCOME.
          Behind them, Daniel climbs out of the pool and runs out to the end
          of the diving board, poised to jump back in.-

          DANIEL,
          Dad! Watch this!
          But John is focused on Esther.- She's opening a big present
          la1aled "FROMi DADDY." Daniel can't get his attention.

          DANIEL
          Dad! 'Dad!! Dad, look!!
          John distractedly glances over his shoulder at him and Daniel does
          a huge cannonball into the pool. SPLASH!
          Suddenly, Esther squeals with glee. She's unwrapped an IIRT EASEL
          and NEW PAINTING SUPPLIES. By the time Daniel-'s smiling face pops
          out of the water, he's disappointed to find that Esther has drawn
          John's attention again, barraging him with-hugs and kisses.
          She looks at Daniel over John's shoulder and hticks her tongue out
          at him. Daniel fumes.

          short in awe. It's the FISH TAN C from the shopping, mall.
          Esther kneels before it, entranced. She turns the black light on
          and off, marveling at- how it makes her dzess glow and the colors

          MRS. GROSSE, is introducing her. Esther's wearing a pretty little
          dress'and Shirley Temple curls, but her usually unflappable smile
          seems wary, uncertain in the face of these staring third graders.

          BRENDA
          Dear Jesus, please help me to not dress

          BRENDA
          Jesus-freak brought a Bible to school!
          Esther angrily swipes at it again, but one of Brenda's friends
          grabs it first. Esther takes a deep breath, trying to calm down.

          reaches for it, but the girls keep passing it between them.
          Esther and Brenda grab it at the same time. There's a brief tug-
          of-war, then the rubber band SNAPS and the Bible flies apart,
          pages and hp otos scattering everywhere.
          Esther gasps in horror and dives to the floor, desperately
          scooping up the loose pages. A"crowd gathers, watching and
          snickering, Daniel and Trevor among them. Esther looks to Daniel
          for help, but he just stands there, watching uncomfortably.
          Brenda laughs at Esther crawling around on all fours.

          hallway. A TEACHER comes running. Trevor puts a hand over his
          mouth so the teacher won't see him laughing.

          The lights - are off. Kate and John are in bed, making lave. Slow,
          passionate, intense. When they're finished,- breathless and
          trembling, she cradles his face in her hands gazing lovingly up

          KATE .
          Esther, honey? What is it? Are you
          okay?
          Esther just glowers at'her, then turns and walks away.

          We need to talk -about last night.

          ESTU
          Do we?

          KATE
          Yes. There are certain things that.
          grown-ups do. that kids aren't supposed
          to see. And that was one of them.
          Esther keeps painting. She still hasn't looked at her. -

          KATE
          Esther, I need you to listen to me..
          Esther pauses. She deliberately sets her paintbrush down and
          turns to Kate. An awkward beat.

          KATE
          See, when two grown-ups love each other
          very, very much, they like to. show that
          love to each other --
          Iknow.- They fuck.
          Kate is dumbfounded. Esther regards her with a bored, aloof-look.

          INT. JOHN'S DEN - DAY

          John is troubled by what Kate has told him.

          JOHN
          - She could nave picked it up anywhere.
          Bell, she probably heard it at school.

          KATE
          This wasn't something she overheard.
          She knew what it meant. And the way
          she said'it. I don't even think she
          expected to get in trouble over it.

          JOHN
          We'll talk to her about it tonight.

          KATE
          You think that's enough?

          

          

          

          

          40.

          JOHN'  
          What do you suggest?

          KATE '
          I could take her to Doctor Browning.

          JOHN
          It was one dirty word. I don't think
          we need to call in the shrink just-yet.

          KATE    
          Maybe. It just reminded The of what
          Sister Abigail said.. We really don't
          know that much about her.'- The last
          'family she-was with could have been -
          like, "Pass the fucking potatoes" at
          the dinner table for all we know. '

          JOHN
          Iget it, I just- don ''t want to make a
          bigger deal out of it than it is.

          KATE
          If she's saying "fuck" to my face,
          what's she doing when we're not around?
          We have to be thinking about what kind
          of influence she's having-on Daniel and
          Max. Particularly Max.

          JOHN
          I wouldn't worry about it. You're
          right, we don't know how she was
          raised, but we do know she's a good
          kid. if Danny and Max want to start
          acting.like her, that's fine with me.

          stop short. A girl approaching on a bicycle...
          It's Brenda. She pretends to not see Bather, just rides right by.
          Esther watches, her face strangely slack... then starts to follow

          Brenda is climbing on the jungle gym with some other kids. Esther
          walks over with Max in tow and just watches Brenda play. Brenda
          sees her and makes a face. Esther just stands there. Staring.

          BRENDA .
          What are you looking at?
          No response. Max tug on Esther's arm, but she's rooted in place,
          staring blankly at Brenda. Finally, Brenda can't take it. She
          climbs off the jungle gym and walks away. Esther watches 'her go..
          Brenda gets on a swing, but just as she starts to get some height,
          Ester' right there,.star n ,_p a her again. Max happily grabs

          But Esther is unwavering. Can't take her eyes off of her. Brenda

          away. Esther calmly walks after her.

          BRENDA
          Go-away! Stop following me, freak!
          Max sees Esther following Brenda and grudgingly gets off the
          swing, hurrying to -catch up. Brenda gives them an angry look.

          " BRENDA
          Why don't you two,go home and change

          Esther and Max follow Brenda across the park,, Max still uncertain
          about what's going on.. Brenda heads for. the tall corkscrew slide.
          Steep stairs lead to the enclosed top, the tip of the rocket ship.
          Brenda starts up the stairs, then pauses. She turns to Esther.

          BRENDA
          You go first.
          Esther doesn't move, but Max gladly takes her turn. After a beat,
          Esther follows Max up the stairs. Brenda stays behind, watching.
          Max goes down the spiraling slide, but Esther just stands at the
          top, looking down at Brenda.

          BRENDA

          Esther, continues to stare down at her for a beat, then turns and
          -disappears from eight. only. then does Brenda climb up.
          Max runs to the stairs for- another turn. Brenda reaches the top
          and looks around. She sees Max.' But where's Esther? She turns.

          Suddenly, Es er is right in ,AIL of her.   She didn't' go down the
          slide, she was just crouched out of sight. Brenda gasps --
          -- then Este spits Jn her face acrd ush hex dawn the airs.
          Brenda SCREAMS as she falls,-limbs flailing, out-of-control. She
          lands hard in the dirt and just lies there crying, clutching her
          arm and bleeding from a gash in her forehead.
          Brenda's scream draws alarmed looks. The Homeless Guy startles
          awake. one of the playground mothers comes running to help. But
          Max stands frozen, gaping at Esther in total shock. Esther stares
          blankly down.at Brenda from atop the slide. Utterly emotionless.

          EXT. PARK - DAY (TIMCUT)

          BRENDA'S FATHER arrives on the scene. Brenda says something. to
          -him and points at Esther and Max, who watch from a distance.

          ESTHER
          Are you going to tell on me?
          Max shrugs.

          ESTHER
          I didn't mean to hurt her. I just
          wanted her-to stop picking on me.
          (off Max's look)
          Don't you hate it when someone is mean
          to you for no reason? Wouldn't you do
          almost anything to make them stop?
          A best. Max nods. Esther offers her hand and Max takes it.

          INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

          Esther and Max sit at the table. Kate and John eye them sternly.

          JOHN
          Brenda says you pushed her.

          ESTHER
          That's not true! We were just playing
          and she tripped! I swear!

          KATE
          (to Max)
          Did you see what happened?
          Esther eyes Max expectantly. Max hesitates. Then:

          MAX

          IT .WAS AN ACCIDENT.
          Kate sighs, not entirely convinced...

          mist of water.--

          INT. SUNROOM - DAY -

          Kate's watering the plants when she feels something on'her hand.
          There's an ANT on it. She flicks it off. Then she seed ANOTHER,
          this one crawling up her arm. She makes a face and looks down.
          Thg g are ante arwl ng loon a-: arou her feet. She
          quickly steps back,- brushing at her- arms and legs. She looks
          under one of the plant tables to'see what's attracted them:
          It's Hodgepodge. He's been dead for several days, his body
          swarming with ants and MAGGOTS.

          EXT.-COLEMAN RESIDENCE ï¿½ GARDEN - NIGHT

          A hole has been dug in the backyard flower garden. Kate, John,
          Esther, and Max stand around it. Max places a shoebox with
          "HODGEPODGE" written on it in the hole and lays a flower on top of
          it. John starts shoveling dirt into the bole.
          Esther and Max exchange a knowing look...

          INT. MAX'S BEDROOM - DAY

          Esther and Max are giggling and playing dress-up. Clothes are
          strewn everywhere. They're both trying to look grown-up. They're
          even wearing makeup -- heavy mascara and pink, painted cheeks.
          Daniel walks by and sees Max putting on lipstick. He takes it
          away from her.

          DANIEL
          Hey, you're not allowed to wear makeup.
          Does mom know you have this?

          ESTHER
          Give it-back.

          DANIEL,
          Make me.

          ESTHER
          Give it back'or I'll tell Daddy, that
          you hit her and then you'll be in
          trouble.
          Max smiles. Daniel-scowls at Esther, then gives Max the lipstick.
          He leaves. Max gives Esther a hug. Best friends forever.

          f l iT. SUPERMARKET - DAY
          Kate waits in line -at the check-out. Esther and-Max are with her.
          Aw .Kate pushes her cart up to the-counter, she looks over and sees
          the nearby'"WINE & SPIRITS" aisle. No big. deal, just a passing
          glance, a flash of idle distraction. Her eyes unreadable. Then:

          ESTHER (O.S.)
          What kind of sex do men crave most?
          Kate-looks back, shocked. Esther has picked up a "COSMOPOLITAN"
          from the newsstand and is'reading the cover aloud-to Max.

          KATE
          Put that away. Don't look at those.
          Kate puts the magazine back. There are several others just like
          it at kids-eye level. "Orgasms UNLIMITED!" "Thrill EVERY INCH- Of
          Him J" Kate'sighs and-'starts putting groceries on the conveyer.-

          ESTHER
          "How To Hit Your G-spot Every Time."
          Kate whirls. Esther has picked up the same magazine. Kate
          angrily snatches it and pulls Esther toward her. Max startles.

          KATE
          Stand where I can see yowl

           
          The CASHIER and a couple CUSTOMERS turn to look at her. Kate
          ignores them. Esther can't suppress a little smile.

          INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

          The family is eating dinner. Esther makes a face and pushes her
          plate away half-finished.  

          ESTHER
          May I be excused?

          KATE  
          At least eat your chicken.

          ESTHER
          I'm not going to eat something that I
          don't like just to make you feel
          better. That's ridiculous.

          JOUN
          Esther, stop it. Eat the chicken and
          then you can be excused.

          ESTHER
          Yes, sir.
          Esther starts eating. Kate gives John an exasperatedlook.

          No explanation necessary. I don't
          think there e'anything that girl could
          say that would surprise me.

          KATE.
          She dropped the 't--bomb on me a few
          weeks ago.
          'Sister Abigail raises her eyebrows in comic, exaggerated surprise.

          SISTER ABYGAYL

          come out of her shell.'

          1OBN
          She's just testing us. It's been
          nowhere near as bad as we expected.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          What kinds of things is she doing?

          -KATE
          Talking back to me. Purposefully
          disobeying. She took Max to the park
          without ppesrmission the other day. That
          was the biggie. A girl they were
          playing with got hurt.
          A beat. Sister Abigail is suddenly apprehensive, tries to cover.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          Really? is the girl all right?

          RATE
          She broke her arm and had to have
          something like eleven stitches, I
          think. She was lucky.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          She doesn't. sound very lucky.

          JOHN
          She's lucky she didn't break her neck.
          Sister Abigail seems troubled by this.

          EXT. COLEMAN RESIDENCE - DAY

          Sister Abigail walks out to her car, concerned. She doesn't see
          Esther spying down from her bedroom.window, just staring at her

          JOHN
          That's right. You both are.
          As they head home, they see JOYCE 'PATTERSON (late 30's) jogging
          toward them. A blonde with dark roots and an overdone boob job.,
          wearing a skimpy sports bra and mini shorts. She waves to tem.

          JOYCE -

          John glances toward home. Kate's at the door, waving goodbye to
          the College Student.- She sees John talking to Joyce and gives
          them an unreadable look before going back inside.

          JOHN
          Uh, yeah. Maybe Kate and I -could help
          you -out.

          JOYCE

          ELEMENTARY ANNUAL HALLOWEEN HOOT." The place is packed with
          excited children in Halloween costumes.

          Max starts to look cared. She nearly leaps. out of her skin when
          a RUBBER--MASTED GHOUL jumps out at them. But Esther just laughs
          at it. Max sees that she's not afraid and soon they're both
          giggling at the CHEESY SPOOKS that try to scare them.

          EXT. CARNIVAL - NIGHT

          Moments later,-Kate and John appear. Rate-nervously looks around.

          RATE
          Where's Max?

          ESTHER
          I don't know. I was trying to hold her

          JOHN
          It's okay. Did YOU see where she went?

          ESTHER
          This way, I think.
          She points the wrong way. Kate takes her hand and they quickly
          move through the crowd, looking for Max. John stands on a bench
          for a better vantage, Kate grabs passersby:

          KATE
          Have you seen a little girl in-a fish
          costume? She has short brown hair?
          Nobody's seen her. Kate grows frantic. Esther watches with a
          nonchalant smile, enjoying the drama.- She tugs on Kate's arm.

          breathes a sigh of.relief and rushes to give Max a fierce hug.

          There's nothing to be afraid of.

          ESTHER -
          I know. Because I'm not- going-

          KATE
          Esther, get out of the cart Righ t now!
          For a moment, they just glare at each other. Mexican stand-off..
          Then Esther sticks her nose in the air and does as she's told.

          INT.-DENTIST'S OFFICE - EXAM ROOM -- DAY

          The DENTIST lowers Esther back in the chair, pulls on rubber
          gloves. The HYGIENIST clips a dental bib around Esther's neck.

          HYGIENIST
          She hasn't had a check-up in about two
          years, so she's a little nervous.

          -DENTIST
          she doesn't look to me. Now
          let's have a look at those co ppers.
          Esther just looks at the ceiling with her mouth tightly shut.

          DENTIST.
          Come on, darling, open wide.
          -Esther eyes him anxiously; then reluctantly opens. Just a bit.

          DENTIST
          That a girl: Little wider...
          She opens more. He leans in to take a look...
          Suddenly, she SHdMPS dawnn his jinx s hard Pnou h to draw blo-mss fr
          and locks ï¿½n like Rottweileï¿½] The Hygienist is frozen in shock.

          DENTIST
          Aaagh! Goddammit!! Help me with her !
          The Hygienist holds her down while the Dentist tries to pry her
          mouth open. Finally, he yanks his fingers free, cradling them

          

          

          

          

          53.
          painfully. Esther HISSES at ldm like a cat, lips flecked with
          blood. The Dentist and Hygienist exchange a startled. lock.

          INT. DENTIST'S-OFFICE - WAITING ROOM -- DAY

          Canned MUSAK.. Kate bits waiting. The Hygienist enters.

          HYGIENIST -
          Mrs. Coleman?
          Kate gives her a confused look. Then she notices Esther htanding
          behind the Hygienist with a-smug grin on'her face.

          INT./EXT. KATE'S MINIVAN - DAY

          Driving home.. Kate stews, on her last frayed nerve. Esther gazes
          out the window, seemingly oblivious, singing a little nonsense
          song under her breath: "La-la-la, la-la-la-la... La--la-la ..."
          Kate stops at a traffic light. Glances outside.
          She's stopped next to a LIQUOR.STORE. Kate quickly looks .away,
          her temptation real enough to startle her. The light turns green
          and she drives off without looking back. Esther keeps SINGING..
          A few blocks later, they pass a BAR. Then a bus shelter with a
          big ABSOLUTE VODKA AD. Kate probably drives by them every day,
          but now they're popping out at her, sly old enemies that never
          really left, re-emerging from the shadowy recesses of her mind.
          She tries to focus on the road, Esther's VOICE grating in her
          head... "La-la-la, la-la-la-la:.. La-la-la, la-la-la-la..."

          INT. FOYER -- DAY

          Kate and Esther enter. Esther skips upstairs. Kate sighs, angry
          and frustrated. She plays a message on the ANSWERING MACHINE.

          SISTER ABIGAIL (V.0.)
          Hello, this is Sister Abigail calling
          for John and Kate. Please call me as
          soon as you get this message. I have.
          something that we need to discuss in
          person. It's regarding. Esther.

          UPSTAIRS
          Esther stands at the top of the stairs, listening to-the message-
          She's heard everything. And she's scared. Scared and pissed.

          INT. KATE AND JOHN'S BEDROOM.- NIGHT

          Kate and John get ready for bed.

          KATE
          He's been our dentist for ten years.
          Why would he lie to us?

          

          

          

          

          54.

          JQAN
          I didn't say he's lying. I just think
          Ws-blowing it out of proportion,

          KATE
          I saw the bite marks. We're lucky he's
          not suing us.

          JOHN
          Fine, but I don't believe for a"second
          that she just did it for no reason.

          RATE
          That's because she's always on her best
          behavior with you.

          JOHN'
          That's. not true. I've had to deal with
          her at her worst..

          - KATE
          What you think is her worst is what
          she's like with me all the time. She's
          completely- different with me than she
          is with you'.,

          JOHN
          So you've seen her haul off'and bite
          someone like an animal?

          KATE
          No, but she threw that fit at school

          JOEN
          Yeah, because the other kids were
          harassing her. It's the same thing
          here.
          (off her reaction)
          She's from a completely different
          culture Kate. She has to be taught
          that this. behavior isn't appropriate
          but there's nothing malicious about it.
          If'she says she bit him because she was
          scared and he was hurting her, I don't
          see any reason not to believe her.
          A beat. Kate looks at him. She's stewing hbaut something.

          KATE
          So should .1 believe her when she says
          you've been hitting on Joyce Patterson?

          JOHN'
          (taken aback)
          Did she say that?
          t.

           

          

          

          

          

          55.

          ]CATS
          Is it true?

          JOHN
          of course not!

          KATE
          Did-she invite You over?'

          JOHN
          She wanted me to help her move a chair.

          KATE
          Oh, - come on.

          JOHN

          ON
          All right, she was obviously coming
          to me. But I shut her down.

          KATE
          Then why didn't you tell me?

          JOHN
          Because I knew how you'd reactl

          KATE
          Really? You sure it wasn't because you
          were coming-on to her so obviously that
          an eight-year-old picked upon it?
          A long-beat. John sighs, resigned.-

          JOHN
          How-long are you going to keep this
          hanging over me? It was ten years ago.

          KATE
          You keep-saying that. But it's only
          been about two years since you told me.
          (a tense beat)
          Having another child was -supposed to
          bring us together.

          JOHN
          I'm sorry I didn't tell you-about it-
          x just feel like I've earned a little
          trust here.

          KATE -
          I don't know what you expect from me.
          I might never completely trust you
          again. Not like before.

          JOHN  
          I gave you a second chance.

          ï¿½4

          

          

          

          

          56.
          Kate stops short. IIis words-are like a phybical blow.

          - KATE -
          That's not fair.

          JOHN
          So-you can keep bringing uP my . mistakes
          over and Over, but we're not even
          allowed to discuss yours?

          KATE
          I was sick! You were just an asshole
          who wanted to fuck somebody else!

          JOHN
          You were a danger to our children. If
          I didn't want to. make this work, I
          could have left months ago and nobody
          would have blamed me.

          KATE
          Nice. Is that-what-your mother told
          you?
          Angry tears well in her eyes. He realizes be went too far.. Kate
          goes into the bathroom and SLAMS the door.

          INT. MAX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT -

          It's late. Esther and Max sit on the bed in their nightgowns.
          Only the bedside light is on. They're signing to one anothe r.

          ESTHER
          THE MAN LADY YS Comm TOMORROW.

          MAX

          I' M AFRAID. I DON'T WANT HER TO TAKE

          YOU BACK TO THE HOME.

          ESTHER

          NEITUER DO 1. WE HAVE TO SCARE HER

          AWAY. WILL YOU HELP ME?
          Max anxiously nods her head. Esther smiles.

          INT..JOHN'S DEN'- NIGHT

          The room is dark. The girls sneak in, still in their nightgowns,
          and close the door. Esther turns on a :reading lamp.

          ESTHER '
          Look for the key to the treehouse.'
          -Max nods and they start searching the room. Esther rifles through
          John 's desk. - Nothing.  She looks in a closet. A DARK PLASTIC
          CASE with Two PADLOCKS on it catches her eye...

          

          

          

          

          57.
          Max opens a. keepsake chest and finds SEVERAL KEYS on:a ring. She
          excitedly shows them to Esther. Esther smiles and takes them. As
          they're about to leave,.Esther. Uses. She looks back at the-
          closed closet. Then looks at the keys. Max eyes her curiously.
          Esther slides a chair over to. the closet and opens it.. She stands
          on the chair, pulls down the case with the padlocks on it, and
          sets it on the floor. She tries a couple of.keys. Then -- CLICK.
          There's a GUN inside. A shiny revolver and a BOX OF AMMUNITION.
          Esther's face lights up. She.carefully picks up the gun{-turns it
          over, looks at it. Max's eyes nearly pop out. Esther gives her a
          sly look, then loads a single bullet, SPINS. the cylinder...
          .and points the cmn at ax. Ri.aht between the Bye

          ESTHER
          Do you -want to_ play? -
          A beat. Max shakes her head. Esther smiles, fingers the trigger.
          After a long, awful, pants wetting eternity, she lowers the gun.

          ESTHER
          You're right. We'd better not.

          (BEAT)
          Not yet. -

          INT. LIVING ROOM -- DAY

          Sister Abigail sits across from Kate and John with a grave look.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          When you first asked about adopting
          Esther, I expressed some misgivings.
          But I wasn't completely straightforward
          with you. You see, I love children.
          I've worked with them my entire life.
          And the thing about love is that it
          sometimes clouds your judgement.

          (BEAT)
          But the truth is that I knew there was
          something wrong with Esther from the
          moment I laid eyes on her.
          Kate sits up, concerned. John bristles.

          - KATE
          You said you suspected, some kind of
          abuse.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          Yes, but there was something else. It
          was hard to say chat it was at first.
          Just-a feeling that she was a
          profoundly damaged little girl.

           (beat) l who
          After you told me about the gir
          broke her arm, -:E -started wondering
          again. I called the achool:Esther went
          to while she was with the Wallaces and
          asked if there'd been any serious
          accidents while she.Was there.. One
          incident was still fresh in everyone's
          minds. A boy in one of her classes was
          stabbed in the throat with a pair of
          'scissors. All the kids-who saw it
          happen said it was an accident, that he
          was running with the scissors and fell.
          But once again, Esther, was there.

          ANGLE - ESTHER
          is eavesdropping from around the corner. She slips away.

          BACK TO SCENE

          JOAN
          But none of these things were her
          fault.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          That's; g I was reluc!tant to t
          anything bef ore. Now'I think th at may a
          have been a mistake.
          (off their-looks)
          Children like Esther, who've spent
          their entire lives-in institutions,
            have never had' a chance to 'form normal,
          lasting bonds.. The longterm effects
          of 'this- can be devastating.   In the
          very worst cases, children who fail to
          form early attachments are unable to
          learn the difference between'right and
          wrong. They can lie, cheat, steal ---
          .or worse -and and have no remorse
          whatsoever for their actions.' They
          view other human beings as objects,
          pawns for their amusement. And they
          can-be potentially very dangerous.

          This.doesh't sound like Esther at all.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          A severely character-disturbed child
          can appear to be -completely normal,
          -even exceptional. It's like they have
          two faces one-they show the outside
          world in order'to get what they want,
          and the other, their true face, lying
          just beneath the surface.

          INT. MAX'S BEDROOM - DAY

          Max sits on her bed, wearing a jacket and clutching her "Bello.

          - E5T_HBR
          Let's go.

          INT. LIVING ROOM  - DAY -


          KATE
          What about the orphanage in Russia
          where she was raised? Wouldn't they
          have been able to tell?

          SISTER ABIGAIL -
          I've put in a call to the director
          there, but she could have easily
          slipped through the. cracks.

          JOHN -
          So the bottom line here is that you
          don't have proof of any of this.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          That's true,-I don't. But I believe
          the circumstantial evidence is enough
          to warrant taking the next step.

          RATE
          Which is what? -

          SISTER -ABIGAIL
          Get Esther out of'the house.
          Kate and John are stunned.

          JOHN
          You want to disrupt the adoption over
          this?!

          

          

          

          

          - 60.

          SISTER ABIGAIL -
          If I'm-wrong, she-can come back home.
          But you need to get her to a therapist
          who can tell you what you're dealing

          WITH

          JOHN
          She's just a kids -  

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          She's also the sole-survivor of a house
          fire that killed her last family.
          (off their looks)
          It was arson. I did some checking.
          Someone deliberately set that fire.
          They-never caught who did it.

          JOHN
          Wait a minute, you're not suggesting --

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          Pyromania is one of the warning signs
          of a character--disturbed child.
          Rate blanches, realizing:

          KATE
          Do you think she had something to do
          with'what happened to Yolanda?
          A long beat. Sister Abigail hesitates, reluctant to answer.

          SISTER ABIGAIL -
          The thought that a child could cougnit
          such a monstrous crime flies in the
          face of everything I hold dear. But in
          my opinion, at'a a possibility that you
          need to take very seriously.

          INT. NOW SHED - DAY.

          Esther slides the door open -on SCREECHING rails and steps inside.
          Walks over to John's workbench. Looks at the TOOL RACK above it.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Kate and John are stunned by what Sister Abigail has told them.

          JOHN
          We can take her to Doctor -Browning. -
          Kate suggested doing that weeks ago.
          But I don't want to send her away. Not
          without at least some kind of proof.
          Sister Abigail.sighs, frustrated. Kate turns to him:

          

          

          

          

          61.

          KATE
          But what if 'the doctor says she's
          dangerous?
          A beat. He considers, uncertain and emotional.

          JOH1
          Then I guess we.won't.bave any choice.

          Daniel sits near.the brook, sullenly throwing rocks in the water.
          He hears something behind him and turns. Esther and Max are

          Neither of them ree him. He eyes them curiously.

          Esther and Max run toward'the bridge where. the road into the
          neighborhood crosses the brook. They climb an embankment and
          crouch. by the bridge abutment, out of breath. Esther looks both
          ways. There's no traffic. She and Max hide behind the abutment.

          INT./EXT. SISTER ABIGAIL'S CAR - DAY

          Sister Abigail drives away., troubled. She takes a pack of
          cigarettes from the glove compartment and lights one.

          EXT. PRIVATE ROAD - DAY

          The girlb wait by the abutment. The only sound is the RIPPLING
          brook. Max looks nervous. Esther gives her a reassuring smile.

          ESTHER -
          It's going' to be fine. Just wave your
          arms and make sure she stops.
          Max nods. Then Esther hears a CAR coming. She peers out'from
          behind the abutment. It's Sister Abigail's car. Esther quickly
          ducks out of sight.

          ESTHER
          Here she. comes. Wait until she gets
          close.
          Max nervously peers out from behind the abutment. Esther stands
          behind her. The car starts across the-bridge. Suddenly --
          -- sthe pusbes Max it into the Load. stumbles and falls
          ri ht ,m. on of the _speedï¿½ car.

          

          

          

          

          62.
          Sister Abigail gasps and SLAMS on the brakes, 'TIRES SQUEALING,
          stopping the car mere feet from where Max lies in the road. She
          frantically. jumps out of the car and kneels next to Max.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          Dear Lord! Are you okay, honey?
          Max looks up at her,-stunned, but unhurt. Sister Abigai1 is taken
          aback. She recognizes her.

           SISTER ABIGAIL -
           Max...?! - -
           A SHADOW falls on Abigail from behind. She turns and looks "up.
           Esther looms.over her, a CLAW HAMMER raised above her head.
          efor is a Abigail Va e a , Esther angrily hits her in tie ' l
           head as hard as she can with the hammer. CRUNCF#.
          Max startles,'eyes wide with shock. Sister Abigail falls and lies
          twitching on the pavement. Eyes staring blankly, one pupil wide
          from the head trauma. Blood trickles from under her headdress.
          As Max stares at. the body, paralyzed with fear, Esther scurries
          into Sister Abigail's car and finds her purse. She flips through
          her wallet. Cash, credit cards. Takes it all. Finds her rosary
          beads. Grabs them, too. Then she hurries back to the body.

          ESTHER
          Help me get her off the road.
          Max looks up blankly, then staggers .to her feet. They each take a
          hand and start dragging Sister Abigail's body, but she's heavy and
          they're little. It's all they can do to slowly move her.
          Then Esther hears something. There's ANOTHER CAR coming. It's
          still out of sight through the trees, but closing.
          Esther and Max hurriedly drag the body, struggling it to the side
          of the road, just as the car rounds the bend. Esther gives the'
          body a kick,, sending it rolling down the embankment.
          The car is almost on them. Esther and Max quickly hide under the
          bridge.. Esther grabs Max's backpack and pulls u wig _cm.
          The car reaches the bridge. Esther listens to it cross, tense,
          gun . ready... . but it passes Abigail's car and continues without
          stopping. Esther breathes a sigh of relief.
          Suddenly, there's a CROARING_noise from behind them.' Esther
          turns. It's Sister Abigail. She's still alive. She's trying to
          speak, but all that comes out is an awful'MOAN.
          Esther scowls and grabs the hammer. Sister Abigail looks up at
          her,' moaning louder. Then Esther brings-the hammer down. CRUNCH.
          The moans stop. Esther hits her AGAIN and AGAIN.

          Good. Let's get her covered up.
          Esther starts scooping leaves and debris onto Sister Abigail's
          corpse. Max just watches fora long beat... then shuffles over
          like a zombie and helps her. Esther smiles..

          That doesn't matter. 'They'll send you
          to jail just for helping me bury her.
          Max starts to cry. Esther moves closer, comforting.

          ESTHER
          She wanted to take me away from you.

          the Homeless Guy across the park and casually heads toward him.
          As she approaches, we see that she's carrying the -plastic yrocery

          She carefully looks around to snake sure nobody is watching, then

          John breathes a sigh of relief. Kate gives-a dubious smile.

          KATE
          She's not dangerous?

          DR. BROWNING
          No, of course not.

          Thank God.

          ESTRER
          May I go to the restroom?

          INT. DOCTOR BROWNING'S OFFICE.- DAY

          Dr. Browning continues. Kate' can't believe what 'she's hearing:

          DR. BROWNING
          I was able to coax her into admitting
          that there's been some tension between
          the two of-you. She's really tr!ing
          very hard to please you. The problem
          is that you're blocking her attempts-to
          attach-with you. That's why whenever
          something bad happens, you blame her,
          whether it's really her fault or not.

          KATE
          But that's not what's.been happening.

          DR. BROWNING
          I doubt you're even aware that you're
          doing it. But subconsciously you t aunt
          her to be bad because' demonizing her is
          your way of covering your own feelings _
          of inadequacy as a mother.

          KATE
          I don't feel inadequate.

          DR. BROWNING
          But you do have doubts. You worry that'
          you Could relapse.

          KATE
          What does that have to do with'Esther?

          DR. BROWNING
          Frankly, everything. Your guilt over
          what happened with Max is preventing-
          you from bonding with Esther.
          Kate turns to John, aghast, but he's taking this very seriously.

          DR. BROWNING
          It's made you doubt your fitness as a
          mother. And that terrifies you. So
          you're having trouble with Esther,
          alonV comes Sister Abigail with these

          When do you think?
          John sighs. A tense-beat.

          JOHN
          I know you were. upset. But we have to
          at least consider the possibility that
          she's right about this.

          KATE
          No, we don't. Why does everybody
          around here get the.benefit of the

          That's not true. I'm just..worried

          someone to help you with the kids if
          it's getting to be too much.

          I don't need help. All I want is for a

          -we first met her, but we can't see what she's doing to it. The

          JOHN -
          She didn't really believe that.

          RATS
          She didn't want to believe it. But she
          was worried enough-to think we should
          put her in foster care until we found
          out for sure.

          JOHN
          For all, her good intentions, sister
          Abigail was not a trained psychologist.
          She'had certain suspicions about Esther
          and they turned out to be wrong. Why
          is can't you accept that?

          KATE
          (a beat, thin)ts)
          What if somebody else thought there was
          something wrong with her? Like the
          director of the orphanage in Russia?
          Esther stops painting and listens, suddenly apprehensive.

          KATE
          if it's a dead end, I'll drop it. - But
          if they say the same thine, then we'd
          have to get.a second opinion.
          John considers. He doesn't want to be unreasonable. He nods.

          All right.- See what you can find out.

          What's the matter?

          ESTHER
          I don't want to go to school.

          I hate it. Nobody likes me there.
          Nobody ever likes me.

          hurt either of you?
          Daniel wants to say something, but the frightened look on Max's

          ESTHER
          It's all right. I understand if she
          doesn't. It must be difficult to love
          an adopted child as much as- your own..

          JOHN
          Sweetheart, .you are just as much a part
          of this family- as Danny. and Max are.
          Mommy doesn't love'you any less because
          you're adopted. Do you understand?
          She nods, but doesn't look convinced. John thinks.

          JOHN
          Why don't you do something special for
          her? So she can see what a good girl
          you are. I'll bet she'd like that.

          INT .'. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
           Rate sits across from John and Dr. Browning.The mood fa grim:

           KATE
          I set the brake. . Bven if I hadn'tr the
          police said it wouldn't have.:rolled
          unless it was put in neutral.

          DR. BROWNING.
          But Max says she didn't see Esther do
          anything wrong.
          Max is cover.ng for her. And X don't
          think it's the first time.

          DR. BROWNING
          It also-wouldn't be the first time that
          you've tried to blame Esther for.
          something that was really your fault.

          XATE
          This. isn-'t all in my head. Sister
          Abigail was right. There is something
          wrong with Esther. And I don't care
          anymore if I can't prove it. I'want
          her out of this house.
          John and Dr. Browning exchange a dark look.

          DR. B' OWNING
          So you're at a place where you would
          actually let somebody take her away?

          KATE
          I'll do whatever I have to,do to
          protect my children.

          JOHN
          56 will 1.
          (re: Dr. Browning)
          That's why she's here.
          something in his voice makes Kate apprehensive. An uneasy beat.

          DR. BROWNING
          I have an opening held for you at a
          residential rehabilitation clinic about
          forty-five miles from here. They
          specialize in extended treatment for
          women who are relapsed alcoholics.
          Kate is stunned silent. She gapes at. them. with a mix of anger and
          fear, unable to stop' a flash of guilt. How much do they know...?.

          

          

          

          

          .82..

          KATE .
          What are you talking.about?

          -JOHN
          I'll stand by you through this for as
          long as it takes. My mom'a already
          agreed., to 'help look after the - kids . .

          RATS
          Tell her not to bother.
          (to Dr. Browning)
          I'd like you to leave now.

          JOHN
          Kate, don't.
          John stands and takes something from inside the sideboard. Ile
          : sets it on the coffee table between them...
          qtr, s
          the wine bottl g she hid " he closet. Kate is stricken.
          She looks at it like it was a poisonous spider.

          JOHN
          The girls found it while they were
          playing in your. closet.

          KATE
          The girls?" You mean Esther found it.

          JOHN
          Yes, Esther found it. Does that make a
          difference? Is she lying?
          A beat. Kate's silence-is answer enough.

          KATE
          I didn't... I bought two bottles. I
          poured the other one down-the sink.

          JOHN
          But not this onie.
          Again, no answer necessary.. Kate looks defeated, tears welling.

          KATE
          I'm not going to rehab.

          JQHN
          I'm not going to leave you-alone with
          the kids again until you do. - .

          KATE
          I haven't had a drink in almost a year.
          John sighs, frustrated.- Dr. Browning intervenes, her voice
          infuriatingly even. and calm.'

          

          

          

          

          83.

          DR. DROWNING
          Relapse is very common in early
          sobriety. We can help you. But not
          until you drop the charade. -

          KATE
          It's not a charade. I wanted to- drink
          i t. You have no fucking idea how.badly
          I wanted to drink it. But I didn't.
          (off John's look)
          I know 1 should have told you..  I was
          just afraid of what you'd do.

          JOHN
          I wanted you to come to me. That's why
          ,I didn't confront you with it last
          night. If Max had gotten hurt this
          morning, it. would've been because I
          trusted you tell me if there was a
          problem.

          RATE
          What happened this morning had nothing
          to do with this!

          JOHN
          l f ow do you expect me to believe that?

           KATE
          Max and Daniel are the only reason I'm
          still sober. I would never do anything
          that would hurt them.

          DR. BROWNING
          You don't think this behavior effects
          them?

          KATE
          You know damn.well what I'm talking
          about.
          _ Her voice is brittle now, barely controlled. A beat. The tears
          sta rt to spill.

          KATE
          When I look out at the pool and
          think...
          (to John)
          When I try to imagine what would have
          happened if you hadn't come home early
          that day... it makes me want to kill
          myself. I would the before I let
          something like that happen again.

          JOHN
          Then why-not throw both bottles away?

          

          

          

          

          84,

          KATE-
          Becauso"I need help. i thought I could
          handle it myself, but I can't. I'll go
          back to-therapy. I'll start going to
          A.A. meetings.

          JOHN
          That's not enough anymore.' I told you
          last time what I'd do if this'ever
          happened again. I'm trying to give you
          another chance.

          KATE -
          You haven't heard.a word I've said.

          JOHN
          I've heard enough. If it was just the
          two of us, that would be one thing.
          But I can't let you be in a position
          where you could hurt the kids.

          KATE
          I'm not the one you need to be worried
          aboutt Seven people close to Esther
          have died in the past year. Max was
          almost the eighth. now many more
          coincidences are you willing to ignore?

          JOHN
          Kate, stop it. You're talking about an
          eight-year-old girl. And right now
          she's making a lot more sense than you
          are.

          KATE
          I know I haven't given you any reason
          to believe me. But you have to. I'm
          begging you.

          JOHN
          I'm sorry. Maybe if you'd been honest
          with me from the start. But not now.

          ANGLE -- MAX AND ESTHER
          peer around the corner, watching them argue. Max is crying.

          JOHN
          You either check into rehab this week
          or I leave and I take the kids with me.
          Esther leans close and whispers into Max's hearing aid:

          ESTHER
          I'll kill her it you tell..

          

          

          

          

          85.
          Max gives her a frightened look.- Just then, Doris.appears with a
          bowl of popcorn. She quickly ehoos the girls away.

          DORIS
          Come on, you two. Let's go watch TV.
          Max wipes her eyes. Esther takes her hand and leads her away.

          EXT. COLEMAN RESIDENCE -- NIGHT -

          John walks Doris out to her car.-He gives her a hug.

          JOHN -
          You sure you don't mind? She's not
          going to appreciate your being around.

          DORIS
          .I don't care what she appreciates. You
          can't leave those kids alone with her
          while you're at work all day.
          (off his look)
          You're doing the right thing. Don't
          let her change your mind.

          JOHN
          I'll see you tomorrow.
          Doris gets In her car. John looks conflicted.

          INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Bedtime. Esther can be heard HUMMING through the closed bathroom
          door. Daniel listens as he sneaks down the hall in his pajamas...

          INT. MAX'S BEDRROM - NIGHT

          Max's eyes are red from crying. She's drawing a picture, but
          hides it under some other papers when Daniel enters. Be closes
          the door. Esther's HUMMING can be heard O.S. A tense beat.

          DANIEL
          Are you okay?'
          Max nods. Daniel sits down next to her. He lowers his voice.

          DANIEL
          Did Esther do something to the van?
          Max turns away and shakes her bead.

          DANIEL
          It's okay. You can tell no. I saw her
          jump out before .it started to roll.
          Max gives him a startled look, suddenly frightened.

          

          

          

          

          86..

          MAX

          DID XOD: TELL ON !3ER?

          DANIEL
          No way. Dad won't believe me. You
          have to do it with me.
          Max shakes her head and starts signing, but Daniel can't keep up.

          DANIEL
          Slow down, 'I don't understand. Did she
          make the van crash?
          A long beat. Max reluctantly nods'. -

          DANIEL
          Then we have to tell Mom and Dad.
          Max starts crying. She signs, but Daniel doesn't understand.
          Frustrated, Max starts hitting him. Daniel grabs her arms

          DANIEL
          -Stop it!- She's going to kill us if we
          don't tell! Morn and Dad can protect
          us!
          Max. shakes her head. Daniel releases her.

          DANIEL
          Why not?

          MAX

          NOBODY CAN.
          Daniel stops short. Max hesitates, then gets up and shows him the
          pictures that she hid from him when he first came in.
          They're crude crayon drawings of Max and Esther. In the first,
          Esther stands atop the rocket ship slide and pushes Brenda down
          the stairs while Max watches..
          The= next one turns Daniel's blood cold. X &'s of Sister Abigail's
          murder. Esther stands over Sister Abigail with a bloody hammer
          wh e r e Max cowers under the bridge. The last one is of Esther and
          Max in the treehouse. Esther is covered in blood.

          DANIEL
          What did she do in the treehouse?

          MAX

          SHE PUT TEE BAD THINGS THERE.
          Suddenly, Esther's O.S."humming STOPS. Daniel looks up, alarmed.

          DANIEL

          'Max quickly hides the. pictures-. Daniel scrambles to the door, but
          -pauses and signs to Max as best he can.

          DANIEL
          Everything's going to be all right.

          INT.'UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Daniel hurries back to his room and closes the door, just as
          Esther emerges from the bathroom. She pauses, suspicious.

           Kate and John are in bed. It's 3:23 a.m.' They both appear to be
           sleeping. Then Kate. moves. She's still wide awake.
           She looks over at John, slowly push the covers back, and inches
           out of bed so that he doesn't wake u es' p. She quietly dresses.
          INT tIPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
          Kate emerges from their bedroom with a small OVERNIGHT BAG and

          Kate slips inside, closes the door; and starts toward Max's bed...-
          Suddenly, a desk light comes on. It's Bather. She's been sitting
          there in the dark. The light casts strange shadows on her face.

          ESTHER..
          Going somewhere, Kate?
          Kate startles and whirls to check on Max. She's. fast asleep.

          ESTHER
          She's fine. Lot's not wake her.

          KATE
          What are you doing in here?

          ESTHER
          1-couldn't sleep. I was-afraid you
          might try to take Daniel and Max away.
          Kate stands frozen, frustrated and'angry.

          KATE
          Go to your room.

           (a beat, stricken)
           Who told you about that. -
           Esther holds up Kate's journal:: Kate blanches.

           ESTHER
           It's in your journal. I found ï¿½it a few
           weeks ago.. It's very intimate. 3
          learned so much about you. Your
          marital troubles, your drinking
          problem. Where you hide your wine
          bottles. You have lovely handwriting,
          by the way. Would you like to bear my
          favorite part?
          Esther has a page marked. She reads:

          ESTHER
          "Eight weeks before my due date,
          Jessica died-from several undiagnosed
          birth defects. I hadn't felt her move
          for days, but now that I knew she was
          dead, I started-to feel her kick again.
          It's called phantom fetal movement,
          like the pain felt in a missing limb.
          I was an amputee and my baby was the
          lost part of me. Because of other
          complications, Doctor Kosgrove didn't
          want to induce. So I had to wait to go
          into labor. For sixteen days I carried
          Jessica's body and felt her ghostnow a kicking in my-belly. y womb
          coffin and inside me slept a corpse."
          (to Kate)
          How perfectly hideous. No wonder you
          turned into a nasty, smelly drunk.
          Kate is dumbfounded, trembling with impotent rage and raw emotion.

          ESTHER
          Kate. You don't know how lucky you are,
          I'll never have children of my own. My
          father paw to that while I was still-in

          weak with horror and grief. John tries to comfort her.

          Kate lies in a bed, barely conscious. A NURSE. pushes -a 'sedative

          sees John talking to Dr. Rajan.

          DR. RAJAH
          We can keep her sedated overnight.
          John nods. He waits for Dr. Rajan and the Nurse to leave, then
          walks over and looks,down at Kate. She's fighting to stay awake.

          JOHN
          Mom's driving us home. I think it's
          better if you stay here tonight. I
          don't want you around the kids like

          her take my family...
          A long, emotional beat. John hesitates, conflicted.
          Then he places her hand back on the bed and turns away. She tries
          to call out, but doesn't have the strength. - She sees the girls
          waiting in-the hallway. Max has been crying. She looks scared.
          John leads them all away. And the last thing Kate sees-before

          ... and stops short at what he sees.
          Esther stands on a chair, cutting slices of cheese with a LARGE
          KNIFE. -She's prepared a plate of fruit, cheese,-and-crackers.
          She's wearing the dress we saw her choose, but with some
          alterations. The ruffles are gone, so are-the sleeves. It's low
          cut and too grown up. Her hair is perfectly curled and her face
          is caked with makeup --- powder, red lipstick, thick mascara, dark
          eyeliner -- giving her a grotesque, woman-child, eight-year-old-
          beauty-queen look. JonBenet Ramsey by way of Angelina Jolie.
          John is stupefied. She szailes at him. Outside, THUNDER RUMBLES.

          ESTHER 4
          Hello, darling.

          JOHN
          What are you doing?

          dinner.

          JOHN
          Get down from there. That knife's too
          sharp for you to be playing with.
          Esther climbs down from the chair and nonchalantly carries the
          cheese and cracker plate to the dining room, as-if he hadn't said
          anything. John follows her, dumbfounded...

          INT. DINING ROOM.- NIGHT

          There are TWO GLASSES and a bottle of SPARKLING WATER on the
          dining room table. Dim lighting and romantic MUSIC. John is
          completely nonplussed. 'Esther sets the cheese plate on the table.

          JOHN

          ESTHER.--
          I wanted to do something special for
          you. I don't like my daddy to be
          unhappy.

          JOHN -
          But why are you dressed like that?

          $STHSR
          Don't you like it?

          JOAN
          No, I don't.- You're not supposed to

            ESTHER
          I'm sorry, sir. I.just want to be as'
          pretty for you-as she is.

          JOHN
          You don't need makeup to be pretty.
          Esther is touched. She gazes up at. him lovingly.

          ESTHER
          You really mean that, don't you?

          JOHN
          of course. Why don't you go wash your
          face and we'll tuck you back into bed.

          ESTHER -
          But-1 worked so hard. Can't we stay up
          just a little longer?
          She gives him the big, sad eyes. They're a little disconcerting
          under all the makeup.. John sighs.'

          JOHN
          -All right. We'll have a little snack
          and then off -to bed.
          Esther beams. John sits down, reluctantly humoring her. Esther
          starts pouring sparkling water into the glasses.

          ESTHER
          We really. should be drinking that
          bottle-of wine, but I couldn't find it.

          JOHN
          Little girls aren't allowed to drink
          wine.

          She raises a glass in toast.: John gives her a sad look, but goes
          along with it. They-CLINK their .glasses together and drink.
          But. instead of sitting down,'Esther continues to stand next to
          'him. She picks up a piece of cheese and tries to feed it to him.
          John eyes her uneasily'. 'Be takes the cheese from her.and eats it.

          JOHN  
          Why don't you sit down?

          ESTBER
          I like being close to you.

          I. thought you loved me. You said I was
          pretty.

          JOHN
          Of course, I love you. But not...
          it's different than how I love Mommy.
          You're my little girl.

          ESTHER
          Will you stop saying that? We can be
          together now, don't you see? She can't

          wrong.

          You're not the first to have been
          fooled. She's even-been adopted
          before. A family here in Estonia took
          her in.and lived with her fog over six.
          months. They never suspected.
          Kate-hesitatesa'b.eat, almost afraid to ask:

          KATE
          But why was ahe at your hospital?

          DA. VARAVA
          Veera is dangerously insane.. She was
          molested by her father and sexualized
          at a very early age. When. he. took
          another lover, he told Veera it was
          because she could heverbe a real
          woman. Veera murdered them both.

          ESTHER
          just stares at herself in the mirror. With her scars revealed,
          her face scratched, her mascara streaked down 'to her chin, and her
          awful, yellow, snaggletoothed sneer, she looks like a monster.

          DR. VARAVA
          She now sees herself as trapped in the
          body of a. child and it disgusts her.
          She wants to. be what her father
          considered to be a "real woman." She t
          wants o be a wife, a mother, a lover.
          She wants to grow up. -
          Suddenly, -she grabs her chair and SMASHES the mirror with it.
          Then she whirls and swings the chair into her aquarium with a
          'feral scream --= CRASH! Water-and fish flood onto the floor.

          DR. VARAVA
          When she was adopted here in Estonia,
          = she tried to find love where she had
          found as a child. With her new lather.

    EXT. FIELD - DAY
1                                                                  1
     We're moving through a cornfield. At speed. The sound of
    children's laughter. Excited shrieking.

     A beautiful young girl, (MARY BOLEYN, 8), our heroine, runs
    through the fields, being chased by her younger brother, GEORGE,
    and sister, ANNE, (10).

     Touchingly, MARY is barely taller than the corn, her head
    skimming along the sheaves.

     REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL: the children are being watched by their
    parents, (SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH BOLEYN).

                            SIR THOMAS
              I received a formal request for marriage
             today for Anne.
                     (a beat)
              From the Carey family.

    SIR THOMAS indicates to
                         ANNE; the eldest. Dark-haired.
    Intelligent. The obvious leader among the children.

                        LADY ELIZABETH
           But that's wonderful.

                        SIR THOMAS
             I turned it down.

     LADY ELIZABETH turns...`What?'

                        SIR THOMAS
            And offered them Mary instead.

    SIR THOMAS indicates 
                         MARY, the middle child. Fair-haired.
    Pretty. Sweet-natured.

                          SIR THOMAS
           Fnne's too good for William Carey. She
           can do (better than a merchant's son.

                          LADY ELIZABETH
            You underestimate Mary.

                          SIR THOMAS
            Not true. I think she's..the kinder of
           the two. Quite possibly the fairer.

    The CHILDREN, meanwhile, have started a race..

                         SIR THOMAS
           But to get ahead in this world, you need
           more than fair looks and a kind heart.

     On the field, ANNE wins. She jumps up and down, holding her arms
    aloft, as MARY flops to the floor. Vanquished.

                                                                2.


    SIR THOMAS smiles, `See?' He walks towards ANNE..

                        SIR THOMAS
                  (applauding his favourite)
           Bravo! Anne!

    Bells ring high up in the bell-tower of a country church.


    INT. MARY'S BEDROOM - DAY

    MARY, ten years older, and grown into a heavenly bride is in her
    room, surrounded by MAIDS and SEAMSTRESSES making final
    adjustments to her dress. A knock at the door.

                        ANNE
           May we come in..?

    ANNE and GEORGE enter. GEORGE lets out a low whistle..

                        ANNE
           Look at you..! Younger than me. More
           beautiful than me. Married before me.
                  (a beat)
           I am eclipsed. I am just the `Other
           Boleyn Girl.'

                        MARY
           Hardly.

                        GEORGE
           No, is this it? This is the end of the
           unholy trinity?

    GEORGE extends her arms, wraps them around his two sister. An
    intimate moment.

                        MARY
           No, George. Never. I'll be married,
           that's all..
                  (a beat)
           Apart from that - it won't change a
           thing.

    The three of them hug together, tightly..


    INT. CHAPEL - DAY

    A packed country church. The PRIEST officiates in Latin. The air
    is thick with incense. And winter cold..




                                                             3.


    The entire BOLEYN FAMILY is assembled on one side. FATHER,
    MOTHER, the DUKE and DUCHESS of NORFOLK, brother GEORGE, and
    finally ANNE..

                        PRIEST
           Confirma hoc, Deus, quod operatus es in
           nobis..

    The PRIEST sprinkles the ring with holy water. WILLIAM CAREY,
    (35), puts it on MARY's finger.

      few rows back, a young NOBLEMAN stares at ANNE. Looks at her
    across the church. Obviously attracted. ANNE notices.


    INT. BOLEYN HOME - NIGHT
5                                                                 5
    The party afterwards. MUSICIANS play. The bride and groom,
    (WILLIAM and MARY), are dancing, surrounded by WELL-WISHERS and
    other GUESTS..

                        WILLIAM
           Are you happy?

                         MARY
           Very.

                        WILLIAM
           You don't secretly wish you'd married
           someone grander? With a title?

                        MARY
           No. I want a husband who loves me. And
           who thinks it first thing every morning.
           And last thing at night.

                        WILLIAM
           Then you've found the right man.

    IN ANOTHER CORNER:

    ANNE is dancing with her brother GEORGE. She looks up to see the
    NOBLEMAN who was staring at her across the church..

                        ANNE
           Who is that? He was staring at me in
           church?

                        GEORGE
           That's Henry Percy. Heir to the Duke of
           Northumberland. Richest landowner in
           England.

    ANNE's eyes widen in interest, "Really?"




                                                      (CONTINUED)

          


                                                              4.


                        GEORGE
           But don't get your hopes up. He is
           already betrothed.

    GEORGE indicates a tall, haughty-looking FIANCEE beside PERCY..

                        ANNE
           Betrothed is not married, brother
           George. A lot can happen before you
           reach the altar.

    ANNE stares over at HENRY PERCY. Who stares back.


    IN ANOTHER CORNER:
6                                                                  6
     he DUKE OF NORFOLK, the most powerful nobleman in the room, and
    close personal friend of the KING's walks with his growling DOGS
    to where SIR THOMAS BOLEYN and LADY ELIZABETH are sitting. SIR
    THOMAS gets to his feet..

                         SIR THOMAS
           Thomas..

     he DUKE ignores THOMAS, and goes instead to his sister, (LADY
    ELIZABETH), and kisses her..

                         NORFOLK
           I think I have managed to persuade the
           King to come and stay with you on
           progress. A week-end's hunting in late
           summer.

                        SIR THOMAS
           But that's wonderful! Thank you, thank
           you so much..
                  (he turns to ELIZABETH)
           Did you hear that, Elizabeth?

                        LADY ELIZABETH
                  (hates the idea)
           Yes.

                        SIR THOMAS
           Finally we can present George, and with
           luck, get him a position at court.

    LADY ELIZABETH excuses herself, and leaves..

                        NORFOLK
           These are difficult times. I have it on
           good authority that the Queen no longer
           bleeds - yet the matter of a male heir
           is still not resolved.
                   a beat)
           It cannot be long before the King is
           forced to look outside the marriage.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

       

                                                             5.


                        SIR THOMAS
           What? And make a bastard King of
           England?

                        NORFOLK
           A legitimized bastard. What choice does
           he have?
                  (a beat)
           Obviously, I've given it thought, and
           wondered which Howard girl I could put
           under his nose. Imagine the influence
           that would give us. To be blood family
           of the next King of England. Equally,
           imagine if another family were to
           achieve the same?

    NORFOLK indicates SIR JOHN SEYMOUR in the corner, and his two
    loathsome, ambitious sons EDWARD and THOMAS..

                        SIR THOMAS
           What about Anne?

    SIR THOMAS turns, and indicates ANNE across the crowds, who's
    dancing with GEORGE...

                        SIR THOMAS
           I realise as a `Boleyn' she is not
           officially a `Howard', but as your
           sister's daughter..

                        NORFOLK
           But she's your eldest, Thomas. Your
           first born. And your favourite. Wouldn't
           you prefer her to have a nice,
           uncomplicated, respectable marriage?
           Like Mary?

                        SIR THOMAS
           If Anne were an uncomplicated,
           respectable girl like Mary, then I'd say
           `yes'. But she's not.

    SIR THOMAS looks out at ANNE..

                        SIR THOMAS
           She's anything but.

    SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH stand in a corner, watching the
    party continue. ELIZABETH's face darkens..

                         ADY ELIZABETH
             don't like it. It would cost a fortune
           to make our house fit for a royal visit.
           Money we don't have.

           And what if theDY ELIZABETH(cont'd)
                        LA king doesn't like her?
           Or if she sleeps with him but gives him
           a girl?

                        SIR THOMAS
           And what if you were to look on the
           bright side? Just once?

    An ominous clap of thunder outside..

                        SIR THOMAS
           Risk nothing, you gain nothing.

     ADY ELIZABETH stares at her husband..

                        LADY ELIZABETH
            hen was it that people stopped thinking
           of ambition as a sin, and started
           thinking of it as a virtue?

                        SIR THOMAS
           Easy for you to say. You've had power
           and wealth all your life.

                        LADY ELIZABETH
           Until I married you, Thomas. And I was
           happy to give it up.

    LADY ELIZABETH turns, and walks back inside.

    ANNE knocks on the door of her father's study. She waits.
    Presently, the door opens. We see SIR THOMAS inside..

                        ANNE
           You asked to see me father?

    MARY is in a bathroom. Being prepared by ANNE for her wedding
    night. ANNE brushes her sister's hair. Rubs oil in her skin.

                        MARY
            o - the King himself is coming to
           Hever. I'm so happy for George.

                        ANNE
           Yes. But Father took me aside. It seems
           he has ambitions for me, too.

            What? What are you saying..?

                         ANNE
            It's known the King has a wandering eye.
            Imagine...if he were to like me?

                          MARY
            But...you could never be more than his
            mistress. And that's no substitute for a
            husband.
                         ANNE
            But as the King's mistress the least I'd
            get after he finished with me would be
            an Earl. And if I fell pregnant? And
            gave him what his wife has failed to?

            Quite apart from the money, it'd be a

            But what about your happiness? Your

     MARY and ANNE enter the bedroom. A sea of candles. MARY stares
     at the bed. A child. Suddenly terrified.

                         ANNE
            Are you nervous?

                         MARY
            A little.

                         ANNE
            You'll tell me everything in the
            morning?

                         MARY
            I promise.

            No details spared?

     The two SISTERS hug tightly. Visibly emotional.






The door opens, and WILLIAM CAREY appears in the doorway. ANNE
curtseys, gives MARY a last `Good luck' kiss, then goes.

MARY stares at her husband.

                    MARY
       Hold me a moment?

WILLIAM CAREY envelops MARY with his arms..

                    MARY (cont'd)
       I'm so lucky to have a man who is
       content with what he has.

MARY looks at him..

                    MARY (cont'd)
       You are, aren't you?

WILLIAM CAREY smiles, looks at his gorgeous bride..

                    WILLIAM
       I am the luckiest man in the world.

WILLIAM reaches for the wine..

                      WILLIAM (cont'd)
       Drink?

MARY shakes her head. But WILLIAM tenderly insists..

                    WILLIAM (cont'd)
       You should. It will hurt less.

MARY nervously drinks..

                      WILLIAM (cont'd)
       Lie back.

MARY lies down. Then she lifts up her nightdress. WILLIAM pulls
down his trousers.

MARY extends her hands. Inviting him to join her. WILLIAM slowly
lowers himself on top of her. He enters her.

MARY smiles, in anticipation of pleasure. A side to her one
might not have imagined.

But one or two strokes later, and WILLIAM's knuckles whiten, his
face reddens, then he cries out, and slumps on top of her.

MARY looks up. Surely that wasn't it?

                      WILLIAM (cont'd)
       Thank you.

     WILLIAM rolls over. MARY stares. Soon WILLIAM snores
     contentedly. MARY is wide awake. Confused.

      aybe this is how it's meant to be.

                                                   FADE TO BLACK:


     EXT. ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
11                                                                11
     The thunder of horses' hooves. A huge cloud of dust.

     The Royal Standard flutters in the wind. Beneath it, a SOLDIER
     in the KING's uniform, riding hard, dirt kicking up in his wake.

     The SOLDIER is flanked by a dozen other of the KING's SOLDIERS,
     who lead a coloumn of fifty or more RIDERS..

     It's like an army. A legion riding into battle. But it's not,
     This is just the KING OF ENGLAND going away for the week-end.

     Behind the advance party, is the KING himself, (30's), handsome,
     in his prime, surrounded by a dozen or so of his closest
     COURTIERS, (among them the DUKE of NORFOLK), a grand, tough,
     intimidating lot.

     Behind them, comes the KING's CONFESSOR, a Priest with a large
     ornate crucifix, a small library of religious books..

     Then, in a riot of colour, come the MUSICIANS, the FOOL and the
     PLAYERS, led by the MASTER of the REVELS.

     Behind them, come the SQUIRES and PAGES, carrying the King's
     weapons, his jousting kit, his swords, his armour, his lance,
     etc.

     Then come the animals: FALCONS, in cages, and the HUNTING
     HOUNDS, beagles and pinchers, barking in excitement, and an
     assortment of FRESH HORSES for travelling, and hunting.

     And finally, bringing up the rear, another unit of ARMED GUARDS,
     and a second STANDARD BEARER..

     The BOLEYN family page, (WILLIAM STAFFORD), is perched on a
     hill. Keeping watch. Staring into the distance..

     Presently, he sees clouds of dust and the sound of thunder
     approaching. His expression changes...

     Pandemonium breaks out among STAFF and FAMILY MEMBERS as
     STAFFORD calls out, "The King!"

         



                                                                10.

     ANNE is being dressed by MAIDS. Hearing the commotion outside,
     she rushes over to the window to see the approaching RIDERS.

     ANNE looks out of the window. Scans the approaching RIDERS until
     she finds the KING..

                           ANNE
            There he is!

     The young HENRY TUDOR is a dazzling, magnetic, intensely
     glamorous and handsome figure. A total contrast from the
     bloated, bearded figure of his later years.

                         ANNE
            You think he will like me?

                         MARY
            Of course, sister. How could he not?

     ANNE turns to face MARY. The two SISTERS embrace tightly.

     The entire BOLEYN FAMILY is nervously assembled outside the
     house, (which we notice has been transformed at great cost. Huge
     marquees in the gardens. Fountains. Additional staff. Smart
     uniforms. New extensions to the stables and kitchens).

     MARY is discreetly hidden, among the CROWDS. ANNE is pride of
     place. Visibly nervous. SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH are beside
     her. The proud PARENTS.

     Everyone bows deeply in deference as the King arrives.

                         SIR THOMAS
            Your Majesty, you are most welcome.

     The King dismounts athletically. His DOGS are unleashed, bark
     excitedly..

                         HENRY
            Sir Thomas.

            Lady Elizabeth..

     A SERVANT in stiff, new uniform, with trembling hands, brings
     wine on a tray. HENRY takes a glass..

                         SIR THOMAS
            May I present my son, George.

     GEORGE, visibly nervous, bows deeply from the neck. But HENRY's
     attention has been caught by a beautiful woman behind GEORGE..

                                                       (CONTINUED)

    

                                                             11.


                         HENRY
                   (while staring at MARY)
            Your Uncle tells me I should have you at
            court. Should I?

                         GEORGE
            It would be a great honour, Sir.

     MARY dutifully, modestly averts her eyes..

                         SIR THOMAS
            And our daughter, Anne.

      ENRY turns to see ANNE.

                          ENRY
            No one said anything of a daughter.

     ANNE curtseys deeply...

                         HENRY
            Had we known, we might have come sooner.

                         ANNE
            Your Majesty..

                         SIR THOMAS
            Perhaps you'll allow Anne to show you
            around our modest house?

                            HENRY
            A pleasure.

     ANNE offers HENRY her hand. He takes it, then leads ANNE away.
     MARY shoots ANNE a look, `Good luck'.

     ANNE leads the KING through the house. She is followed at a
     distance by SIR THOMAS BOLEYN. And watched by MARY and GEORGE
     from a gallery above..

                         ANNE
            Here is the library.

                            HENRY

                           HENRY
            What's that?

     HENRY points at an emblem above a doorway..

                           ANNE
                falcon, your Grace.

                         HENRY
            I can see that. But what's it doing
            there? More to the point..
                   (turns 360)
            ..not just there, but in every corner in
            the house?

                         ANNE

            Perhaps because falcons are vaguely
            associative with field sports - field
            sports with aristocracy - and in the
            absence of a genuine coat of arms..
                   (shrugs)
            ...a man with ambition will do the
            strangest things.

     HENRY is delighted by ANNE's candour..

                          ENRY
            That's a sharp tongue you have.

            Oh, his Majesty has nothing to fear from
            me. Unless he fears an excess of
            compliments.

     HENRY smiles, visibly charmed..

                         HENRY
            Really? And what would they be..?

     WATCHING FROM ABOVE, MARY smiles to herself, "Well done, Anne",
     as HENRY and ANNE continue down a corridor..

            My girl. My dear, remarkable girl. I
            knew you would up to the task.

     MARY watches. A momentary stab of jealousy at FATHER's
     attention. But as ANNE looks over at MARY for support..

     MUSIC is being played. Everyone is dressed in their finest, a
     packed banquet hall. MUSICIANS come to a climax, loud and
     enthusiastic applause from everyone. HENRY gets to his feet..

                     RANDON
       Years behind their Italian counterparts.
       The truth is far from leading the world,
       we're a provincial outpost, lagging far
       behind.

                    HENRY
       It's true.

                    ANNE
       The universities in Spain and the
       philosophers in Germany may be strong,
       but are they really the equal of Oxford
       and Thomas More?

                    HENRY
       Never!

       I doubt there is a country that is
       fairer in Government, or better
       protected by nature from her enemies,

     EXT. HEVER CASTLE - STABLE YARD - DAY

     The following morning..

     Thirty or more RIDERS, STABLE-BOYS and HORSES are gathered. To
     one side, a deafening pack of DEER-HOUNDS, (wire-haired
     Lurchers), barking frantically.

      t's a scene of great activity, excitement, and anticipation.

     The MASTER OF THE HORSE helps HENRY mount his steed - the
     biggest and most glamorous stallion of all, with wonderful,
     ornate saddlery.

       number of OTHER LADIES are also going hunting, and we notice
     they ride pillion, (ie), riding on the same horse as their MEN,
     sitting behind them, holding onto them..

                         HENRY
             ho will you be riding with?

     It's clearly an invitation. He indicates there is room for ANNE
     on the back of his saddle. But ANNE fails to read the signal.

                         ANNE
            On my own your Grace.

                          HENRY

     A STABLE-BOY leads out her horse.

                         ANNE
            They have invented a new saddle which
            allows ladies to ride on their own.

     ANNE skilfully mounts the horse, and sits upright..

                         HENRY
             ut with no man to hold onto? How will
            you stay on the horse?

                         ANNE
            Why? The same way you hold onto yours,
            your Grace.

     A flicker behind HENRY's eyes. It's the first wrong move ANNE
     has made.

                          HENRY
            We'll see.

      ENRY yanks the reins on his horse..

                          HENRY
            Let's away!

     ANNE shoots a look at MARY. Then follows.

     The thunder of hooves..

     WILLIAM STAFFORD leads the way out with a pack of some forty or
     fifty hounds. It's a stirring sight. Following the hounds, come
     thirty or forty RIDERS, led by the KING himself.

                         HENRY
                   (kicking his horse)
            Hah!

     Up ahead, the HOUNDS start to bark. Their pace increases.
     They've got a scent. The BUGLER blows his horn..

     The DOGS begin to increase their pace. The RIDERS urge their
     horses to gallop. The LADIES hold tight to their MEN..

     Up ahead, a STAG, wide-eyed, innocent, lifts it's head..

     The sound of the hunting bugle and the roar of approaching
     footsteps, like thunder.

     The STAG twitches in fear, then bolts off towards the forest.


     EXT. FIELDS - DAY
24                                                                24
     The DOGS and RIDERS roar across fields. The hounds snarl, almost
     delirious with primal agitation..

     Among the RIDERS, the more advanced HORSEMEN have already opened
     up a clear lead on their weaker counterparts..

      n the advanced group, are HENRY, several COURTIERS, his GUARDS
     and, of course, ANNE..

     They jump over a hedge. One of HENRY's COURTIERS catches the
     hedge and falls. HENRY smiles, then turns to see..

     ANNE comfortably jumping the hedge herself. HENRY's smile fades.
     He urges his horse to greater speed..

                           HENRY
                     (kicking his horse)

     The terrified DEER bolts into safety of the forest. The barking
     HOUNDS, locked into the scent, follow.

      he RIDERS see this, and some pull up.

                          IDER
            We've lost him. He's in the forest.

     Galloping through trees and thick forest is not for the
     fainthearted. But HENRY charges past, kicking up dirt..

                         HENRY
            Then we must follow.

     HENRY weaves skilfully through low-hanging branches. He looks
     over his shoulder, ANNE follows, close behind..

     Sharp branches tear at HENRY's face. Some draw blood. Behind
     him, several other COURTIERS suffer lashes from the branches,
     and pull up. But not ANNE. She kicks her horse harder. Seemingly
     impervious to the whipping branches..

                           ANNE
            Hah!

     Ahead, the DEER darts and weaves. The HOUNDS give chase.

      alf a mile ahead..

     A steep ravine, with a sheer drop of twenty-five feet deep. At
     the bottom, a brook with dangerous rocks, then another sheer
     climb of twenty-five feet the other side.

     The DEER arrives, looks, then scampers down the ravine, pursued
     by the HOUNDS.

      he remaining RIDERS arrive. They see the DEER scramble up the
     other side, followed by the DOGS, slipping in the mud, and
     struggling with the brook.

      everal DOGS fall. Yelping in fright and pain as they lose
     footing and fall on the rocks. The KING pulls up his horse..

     HENRY raises his hat, and salutes the DEER.

                          ENRY
             he King of England defeated by a humble
            fawn.

     The COURTIERS laugh, then they turn their horses around and head
     off. ANNE stares. It's a clear opportunity to impress. She looks
     down at the rocks. A long stare, then..

                         ANNE
                   (suddenly kicking horse)
            Hah!

     The COURTIERS gasp in disbelief as ANNE lurches forward, and
     leaps into space, heading fearlessly down the sheer ravine.

      orse and rider almost tumble down the vertiginous, lethal drop.
     But, reaching the bottom, the horse leaps across the brook, then
     scrambles up the other side.

     She made it! Exhilarated, ANNE turns, breathing hard. The KING
     stares at her. The COURTIERS stare at her.

         long silence. Nothing but the sound of wind in the trees..

                           COURTIER
              Please, your Majesty. It's not safe.

     HENRY turns and stares daggers at the COURTIER, `Silence'. He
     stares across the ravine at ANNE. Their eyes meet.

      hen he kicks his horse, `Hah!', and lurches forward. He heads
     down the sheer ravine. The COURTIERS gasp, rush to the edge of
     the ravine to watch. ANNE goes to the edge her side.

      ENRY's horse slides perilously down the ravine, then struggles
     to clear the brook, and lands heavily in the water.

       he KING struggles to keep control, and as the horse tries to
     scramble up the bank the other side, it loses it's footing in
     T
     the mud, it's hooves grasping horrifically at air..

      he COURTIERS cry out in horror, ANNE covers her mouth as..

     The KING's horse falls backwards, unseating HENRY, sending him
     flying, and worst of all, landing on top of him as they fall and
     tumble dreadfully down into the brook, and onto the rocks..

     Pandemonium breaks out. The sound of shouting voices, cries of
     horror, raising the alarm.

     ANNE's FACE: what has she done?

     HENRY slowly comes to, to find himself staring at a number of
     faces. A PHYSICIAN, SIR THOMAS BOLEYN, the DUKE of NORFOLK, one
     or two COURTIERS, and finally, ANNE..

                           PHYSICIAN
              It's a miracle, Majesty, you have no
              broken bones..

     HENRY flinches in agony, tries to move..

                           SIR THOMAS
              My daughter Anne is here. Would like to
              apologise.

                            ENRY
                     (recoils, his pride hurt)
              No! Get her away from me!

     ANNE opens her mouth, wants to protest, but is hastily ushered
     out of the room.

                    HENRY
       And who are you?

                    MARY
       Mary, your Grace. Anne's younger sister.

HENRY looks her up and down..

                    HENRY
       You've been here all week-end?

                    MARY
       Yes, your Grace.

                    HENRY
       Really? How could I have overlooked you?

                    MARY
       Next to Anne, it's easy to do.

                    HENRY
       Nonsense.

       Yes, your Grace. To William Carey.

                     ENRY
       From Wolsey's office?

                    MARY
       Yes, your Grace.

                    HENRY
       Then why haven't I seen you at court?

                    MARY
       Because I have persuaded him to spend a
       year or two here first. We have a small
       manor and some land. Nothing much. But
       enough to start a family.

                    HENRY
       A charmed life in the country? Away from
       it all?

                    MARY
       Yes.

     MARY lowers her eyes..

                         MARY
            But, if he ever changed his mind, I
            would always support him.

     HENRY stares at MARY.

     Strapped and bandaged, HENRY is helped onto his horse. Beside
     him GEORGE BOLEYN is also on a horse, riding off to court for
     the first time..

     SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH bow, curtsey farewell..

            Thank you again, Lady Elizabeth. We'll

            Just Mary.

MARY stares imploringly..

            What if we just refused?

                         WILLIAM
            We would be cut off. He made that clear.

                         MARY
            But would that be so bad?

     MARY stares at him..

                         MARY
            Position means nothing to me. Nor
            wealth. We could find somewhere. A small
            farm. Away from everything.

                         WILLIAM
            You say that now - but when you're
            older? And our children are grown up?
                   (comforting her)
            This won't last long. A year. Maybe two.
            And at the end of that - we'll we have
            everything we want.
                   (a beat)
            It's for our FUTURE.

                         MARY
             ut can't you see? Do this, and we might
            not HAVE a future.

     MARY is getting ready to leave. She turns a corner and `bang',
     walks straight into ANNE. A tense moment. The two SISTERS stare
     at one another..

                         MARY
            I'm so sorry..

                         ANNE
            What for? You think I want the King? Or
            to be used and abused by him?
                   (puts on brave smile)
            No! You're welcome to him. I have my own
            plans, which don't involve becoming a
            rag that will one day be discarded.

     MARY stares, saddened, `Oh, Anne', but there's no time to talk.
     She has to go. ANNE is left. Her eyes blazing.

     MARY and WILLIAM ride through London streets escorted by
     SERVANTS bringing their belongings. They approach Whitehall
     Palace. Armed GUARDS slowly open the gates.

     MARY's face: as the heavy gates open. She shoots a last look at
     the `free' world outside. Then, she rides through the Palace
     gates.

     `CLANK', the heavy doors shut behind her.

     The outside world has been totally sealed off. Faces appear at
     palace windows, staring down at the `new arrivals'.

      mong them: is HENRY himself. He stares out of the window. Sees
     MARY. Then he lets the curtain fall.

     KATHERINE of ARAGON, (late-30's), imperious, intimidating,
     Spanish. Surrounded by other LADIES IN WAITING, (mostly high-
     born, Spanish, and the QUEEN's age). A SERVANT announces..

                         SERVANT
            Mary Carey, Ma'am.

     QUEEN KATHERINE looks up..`Who?'

                         QUEEN KATHERINE
            Who?

                         SERVANT
            The new Lady in Waiting.

       Really? But I was not expecting anyone.

                     ERVANT
       Appointed by...his Majesty the King.

                    QUEEN KATHERINE
       By my husband? Really?

The air crackles with tension. It's school bullying.

                    QUEEN KATHERINE
       Well, then she must be some kind of
       gift. He must have seen in her some
       special talent that would please me.
       Tell me. What special talent is it that
       you have?
               with icy contempt)
       Apart from your obvious youth and
       beauty?
T

                    QUEEN KATHERINE
        oetry, perhaps?

                    MARY
       N-no..

                    QUEEN KATHERINE
       Or dressmaking?

                    QUEEN KATHERINE
       Music! That's it! You compose? Or sing?

                    MARY
        ..I'm afraid not. Your Majesty.

                    QUEEN KATHERINE
       Come, you're too modest.
               turns to a MUSICIAN)
       Signor Vasquez.

The Spanish GUITARIST obliges by starting to play a well-known
tune of the period..

                    MARY
       No..really..I beg you, your Majesty.

                   (barks, suddenly terrifying)
            I command you to SING!!!

     MARY flinches. Blushing deeply, her skin glowing with
     perspiration and terror, she begins to sing..

     Normally she sings well. But her voice now is strangled with
     fear. MARY stands rigid, her knuckles whiten, nails digging into
     her hands, drawing blood.

     Finally, MARY finishes. The room is silent. All eyes on
     KATHERINE, who stares coldly. A formidable adversary.

                         QUEEN KATHERINE
            Bravo! A nightingale!
                   (the cruel satisfaction of
                    victory)

     MARY walks through the packed corridors of court, her face
     burning from the humiliation. The sound of a voice behind her..

                         WOMAN'S VOICE
             ait! Mary! Stop!

     But MARY does not hear. She continues walking, distressed, and
     distractedly enters..

     Finally, she is caught by JANE PARKER, whom we had seen at the
     window earlier. Younger, also English, a kindred spirit..

                         JANE
            I know that must have been agony, but
            put yourself in her shoes. She knows the
            only reason the King has asked you here
            is because he desires you. For a wife
            that must be very difficult.

            She's a good woman. Trust me.

     JANE smiles. MARY manages a smile..

                           MARY
            Yes.

                         JANE
            I've seen him a few times at court. And
            like him...very well.

            But I don't think he has noticed me.

                         MARY
            I can't imagine.
                   (a beat)
            Should I mention you to him?

                         MARY
            Of course. Happily.

      ANE PARKER smiles. But as soon as MARY's back is turned, the
     smile fades.

     A large dusty yard, where KNIGHTS train for combat, and practise
     their fighting skills. MARY is with GEORGE, who is putting on
     his armour..

                         GEORGE
            Not noticed her? Jane Parker? Of course
            I have. How could I not? She looks like
            a goat.

                         MARY
            Well, she likes you, and asked me to
            give you this..to remember her by.

     MARY hands over a handkerchief..

                         GEORGE
            Ugh. Well say you haven't seen me. Or
            that you forgot.

     GEORGE hastily gives it back..

                         GEORGE (cont'd)
            There is something about that woman that
            makes me feel...

     GEORGE gets to his feet, indicates to his MALE COURTIER friend
     that he is coming..

            And our sister? Any word?

                         GEORGE
            ANNE? You know she took being upstaged
            by you very badly.

                           MARY
            Yes, I know.

                         GEORGE
            And no amount of interventions on my
            behalf would make her believe you hadn't
            done it intentionally.

                         MARY
            But you KNOW I would never do anything
            like that.

                           GEORGE
            I know.

     GEORGE finds his helmet, puts it on..

                         GEORGE (cont'd)
            Just give her time. She'll come round.

     MARY watches GEORGE go to join the other MALE COURTIERS.

     MARY enters her room, and closes the door. She begins
     undressing, taking off her clothes, then catches sight of a DOG
     in the shadows. She gasps. It's the KING's dog.

                         HENRY (O.S.)
            Please, don't be alarmed.

      ENRY steps out of the shadows..

     MARY covers herself in modesty, and falls to her knees in a deep
     curtsey of deference. HENRY steps into the light, walks towards
     her..                H
                          ENRY
            I wanted to find somewhere we could be
            alone so I might say a few words to you
            in person.

      ENRY turns, looks around the room..

                         HENRY
            I hope your accommodation is
            comfortable. I realise it's no

            What are you..?

     MARY's dress comes off her shoulder. The KING's eyes, however,
     instead of staring at MARY's beautiful, exposed body, stay
     focused on her eyes. An uncomfortable moment..

                         HENRY
            I am sorry.
                   (delicately putting her
                    clothes back on MARY)
            You obviously misunderstand me.

     MARY standing in the room..

            Your opinion, Uncle.

     MARY speaks quietly. Lowers her head..

                         MARY
            Mine is that it's the greatest insult of
            all.

     An incense-filled Royal Chapel. The ARCHBISHOP is giving mass,
     in Latin, for the Royal Household.

      he King sits at the front, on the left. With the men. The
     ladies are separated, as is traditional, and sit on the right.

     HENRY is lost in prayer. It's not long, however, before he turns
     to look at MARY.

     Meanwhile, a remote country parish church. Far away.

       local PRIEST arrives. He sees two HORSES tethered to a tree by
     the side of the church. He dismounts. Checks no one has followed
     him.

     In the Royal chapel: the ARCHBISHOP solemnly performs the
     Eucharist, breaking bread and making wine from blood..

     But, in full view of all those in the chapel, the KING continues
     to stare at MARY.

      inally, she looks up. Their eyes meet. MARY blushes, averts her
     gaze. But then, for the first time, she reciprocates. And looks
     back.

     This is witnessed by the QUEEN, and further back, by the DUKE of
     NORFOLK and SIR THOMAS BOLEYN.

     Everyone is pretending to focus on the MASS. But none of them
     can concentrate..

     the dark. Everywhere, long shadows, eerie darkness..

            No.

                         PRIEST
            You brought the money.

     ANNE hands over a purse of coins. They walk to the altar..

                         PRIEST
            And the groom? Is he here?

     Up ahead, the GROOM slowly steps out of the shadows. Now we see
     his face. It's HENRY PERCY.

                          RIEST
            Good. Then let us begin.

     Back at court: the service ends.

     Everyone in the Royal Household filters out of the church. But
     it's a very different atmosphere to when they entered..

     The extent of HENRY's affection for MARY is now public knowledge
     evidenced by..

     ..the attention SIR THOMAS and NORFOLK now receive from CARDINAL
     WOLSEY and THOMAS CROMWELL, and the way in which QUEEN KATHERINE
     and her SPANISH LADIES are being neglected.

     MARY allows herself a private smile of satisfaction. Surprised
     at how good it feels. To be the number 1.


     INT. MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT

     MARY lies in bed, in a room covered in flowers. She admires a
     beautiful necklace in a box, and a handwritten letter from the
     KING. We can see from MARY's face how much she likes it.

     Presently, urgent `knock', `knock', at the door. MARY's eyes
     widen in excitement. The King?

     She hurriedly closes the necklace's box. Tucks the letter away
     in a drawer.

     She gets out of bed. Anxiously straightens her hair, then goes
     to the door, to find..

     GEORGE, her brother, who bursts in..

                         MARY
            George? It's the middle of the night.

               (horrified)
       What?

                    GEORGE
       In secret. Without telling anyone!

MARY's face falls..

                      MARY
       Oh, no...!

       You don't look pleased.

                    MARY
       Why would I be pleased?

                    GEORGE
       It would make her the future Duchess of
       Northumberland. Our sister!

                    MARY
       But they'll never allow it, don't you
       see? He's already precontracted to Mary
       Talbot, and if word of the consummation
       gets out her reputation will be ruined..

MARY pulls back her sheets..

                    MARY
       ...I have to tell Father. Before it's
       too late..

                      GEORGE

     INT. SIR THOMAS'S STUDY - BOLEYN HOUSE - LONDON - DAY
49                                                               49
     A FAMILY MEETING: ANNE and HENRY PERCY, (the HANDSOME YOUNG
     NOBLEMAN from Mary's wedding), stand in front of the DUKE of
     NORFOLK and SIR THOMAS BOLEYN and GEORGE..

                         SIR THOMAS
            What were you thinking? The marriage of
            a senior noble is a matter of state.
            Something only the King can decide..

     HENRY PERCY looks down, avoiding eye contact..

                         NORFOLK
            Who knows about this?

                         ANNE
            No one.

                         NORFOLK
            Then that is how it shall remain.
            Forever.

                         ANNE
            But you cannot undo what has been done
            before God.
                   (defiant stare)
            And consummated too.

     `Snap', NORFOLK's quill breaks. SIR THOMAS almost chokes.
     GEORGE's eyes widen..

                         NORFOLK
            WHAT?

                         SIR THOMAS
                   (struggling to contain his
                    anger)
            There have been improper intimacies,
            too?

                         ANNE
            I have lain with my husband. There is
            nothing improper about it..

                         NORFOLK
            SILENCE! My God, if you were my daughter
            I'd thrash you within an inch of your
            life..

     ANNE recoils, terrified..

                         SIR THOMAS
            The boy will return to Northumberland -
            where he will marry the Talbot girl. As
            arranged.

     SIR THOMAS gives the signal for WILLIAM STAFFORD to escort PERCY
     out.

                          ORFOLK
            As for you. You will go to France and
            stay there until you have learned your
            lesson.

                         MARY
            What?

                          ORFOLK
            How could you do this to your sister?
            You know full well her friendship with
            the King is at an extremely delicate
            stage. Any scandal or black mark against
            Mary's name now could be fatal.

     SIR THOMAS dismisses her..

                         NORFOLK
            You will join the court of the French
            Queen. And stay there until your father
            has forgiven you.

     ANNE goes. GEORGE follows..

     MARY paces anxiously in the corridor. Presently, ANNE emerges
     from the room. Burning with humiliation. Their eyes meet. MARY
     is about to speak, but ANNE cuts her off..

                         ANNE

            How COULD you?

                         MARY
            Because you would never have got away
            with it. And it would have ruined your
            prospects forever.
                   (a beat)
            Believe me. I did it for your good.

                         ANNE
            Really? For MY good? I'll try to remind
            myself of that. While I'm in exile. And
            you're here, in the King's bed, and
            unchallenged for our father's affection.
                    a beat)
            That it was for MY good. Not yours.

     ANNE storms out. GEORGE shoots MARY a look, "I'll deal with
     this", and runs after ANNE..

     OVER THIS: we fade in MUSIC and the sound of laughter..


     INT. BALL-ROOM - PALACE - NIGHT
 1                                                               51
     A grand MASQUE BALL. We're in a spectacular candle-lit ballroom.
     MUSICIANS play. Large formations of DANCERS perform elaborately
     choreographed moves. Among them we pick out..

     SIR THOMAS BOLEYN stalking the party. Ever watchful. On duty.
     Vigilant. He is distracted by the sight of...

     His son, GEORGE BOLEYN, surrounded by FRANCIS WESTON and his
     FRIENDS. GEORGE is clearly in his element. Laughing in delight.
     Very fond and intimate with FRANCIS WESTON..

     SIR THOMAS looks concerned for the first time.

      n another corner, MARY is in costume, but looking forlorn. She
     watches proceedings with a blank, distant expression. Presently,
     a voice behind her..

                         MASKED MAN
            Why look so glum, Mary?

     MARY turns to see a MASKED MAN behind her.

                         MARY
            What reason have I to be happy?

                         MASKED MAN
             ou have two men, the King of England
            and I, both fighting for your love.

     The MASKED MAN is tall. His voice is quiet, but strong.

                         MARY
            Do I know you?

                         MASKED MAN
            You know me, Mary - but not half as well
            as I know you. I know you better than
            anyone here. And love you better than
            anyone here, too. And if God had made ME
            your husband instead of William Carey,
            one thing I know..
                   (a beat)
            I would never have let you go.

     MARY's smile fades..

                         MARY
            Wait! Who ARE you?

MARY lunges for the MAN's MASK to try and remove it, but the MAN
retreats into the safety of the shadows. Meanwhile..

All around MARY the crowds part, and a deep voice booms out.

                     ASKED MAN #2
       Ah! Who have we here?!?

MARY turns to see a SECOND MASKED MAN, (unmistakably the KING),
surrounded by COURTIERS.
                     M
                    MARY
       My name is Kindness.

                      MASKED MAN #2
           wonder, will you be kind to me?

                    MARY
       What is it you desire?

                    MASKED MAN #2
        our love, fair Lady.

                    MARY
       You demand a great deal.

                    MASKED MAN #2
       No more than I would give in return.

MARY notices her FATHER is among the masked COURTIERS. His eyes
giving MARY cues..

                    MARY
       It is easy for a man to declare love
       from behind a mask.

                     ASKED MAN #2
        ut if I remove it, you might reject me.

                    MARY
       If your feelings were sincere, I would
       never reject you.

                    MASKED MAN #2
       But you do not know who I am? I could be
       ugly. Or poor.

                    MARY
        o matter how you looked. Or who you
       were.

                    MASKED MAN #2
       Really? Then I shall hold you to your
       word. And unmask..!

With a flourish, the KING rips off his mask..

                         MARY
            Your Majesty..!

     SIR THOMAS urgently nods, `Go on!' MARY theatrically swoons.
     Falling into the KING's arms. A gasp among the COURTIERS..

                         HENRY
             he faints! Quick! Take her to my rooms!
            Call my physicians..!

     SIR THOMAS quickly picks MARY up. He carries her through the
     crowds, out of the ball-room..

     QUEEN KATHERINE watches from a distance. A flicker of pain.
     Then, with great dignity and pride, she turns back to watch the
     entertainment..


     INT. KING'S APARTMENT - COURT - NIGHT

     `Thump', the doors open, and MARY is carried into the King's
     apartments. HENRY fusses, brings water. Opens windows.

                          ENRY
            Go! Leave us! Go!

     SIR THOMAS bows to the KING, shoots MARY meaningful look, `Don't
     fail me', and retreats. HENRY closes the doors. He and MARY are
     left alone.

     HENRY makes her comfortable.

                         MARY
            Thank you, your Grace.

                         HENRY
            `Henry', please. The first rule of this
            room, is to leave `Your Grace's' and
            `Your Majesty's' outside.

      ENRY looks up..

                         HENRY
            Is there anything I can bring you?

                         MARY
            No.

                         HENRY
            Nothing to increase your comfort or well-
            being?

                         MARY
            You might ask your servants to bring me
            some water.

     HENRY goes to get water himself..

                    HENRY
       There. There ARE no servants.

MARY's eyes widen. The KING of ENGLAND brings her a drink! MARY
takes a sip of her drink and watches as HENRY goes behind a
screen and begins to remove his costume. His mask.

MARY notices a mirror, and watches in the reflection of the
mirror how HENRY removes the costume and status of KING and
becomes a MAN. Private.

 ENRY visibly unwinds, his facial muscles relax. He breathes out
deeply. His face becomes softer. More gentle. Then he puts on a
comfortable robe, and emerges from behind the screen.

HENRY goes over to a pile of cushions, and flops down - and
smiles at MARY.

                    MARY
       So, this is it? This is where the King
       of England sleeps?

                    HENRY
       And reads. And writes. And finds a few
       moments each day...
              (gestures)
       ...for himself.

HENRY smiles at MARY..

                    HENRY (cont'd)
       You look surprised?

                    MARY
       I am. I suppose it's more..

MARY looks at the bed, the books, the pages of writing on the
desk..

                    MARY
       ..simple than I imagined.

                     ENRY
       There's no need for show. I am only ever
       here alone.

                    MARY
       And yet you invite me here?

                    HENRY
       Because I trust you.

                    MARY
       You hardly know me.

MARY smiles, admitting he's right.

                    MARY
       No.

                    HENRY
       I also sense...that you might relish an
       opportunity to be yourself, too.

                    MARY
       Yes.

                    HENRY
       Well, here you only say what you like,
       do what you like.
                    M
                    MARY
       Very well.

MARY smiles. Stretches out her legs. Relaxes..

                    MARY
       I'd like an apple, please..
              (can't believe she's saying
               this)
       ..Henry.

HENRY jumps to his feet, brings MARY an apple. MARY laughs,
`Thank you'. Bites into the apple..

                    MARY
       Now it's your turn.

                    HENRY
       What?

                    MARY
       To say something, or do something you
       couldn't outside.

                    HENRY
       There are many things I cannot admit to
       in public. Sadness, for example. And
       loneliness.

                    MARY
       But when you are loved as much as you
       are? How can you be lonely?

                         HENRY
            Do you not know what it is to be lonely
            in a marriage?

                         MARY
            Yes. I do now.

                          ENRY
              married my brother's widow because my
            father ordered it. As a duty. To keep
            the alliance with Spain. And she is a
            remarkable woman. And wife.

     HENRY looks at MARY..

                         HENRY
            But I never looked at her or longed for
            her the way I do you.

     HENRY reaches out. Their hands meet..

                         HENRY
            Imagine how different it might have
            been. For both of us..had we been able
            to chose for ourselves..

     HENRY leans forward and they kiss. Gently at first. MARY
     resisting. Then harder..

      ensing this, the KING picks MARY up and leads her to the
     canopied bed, and lays her down..

     They begin to make love. As radical a contrast to the scene with
     WILLIAM CAREY as it is possible to imagine..

     MARY's eyes open. She gasps. Her hands grip the sheets..

     Several hours later:

     WILLIAM STAFFORD is fast asleep in a window seat in the corridor
     outside. Finally, the door opens. And MARY emerges from the
     KING's apartment.

     The DUKE of NORFOLK's dogs are eating breakfast out of bowls by
     the fire. Slurping hungrily.

     The entire family is gathered. SIR THOMAS, LADY ELIZABETH. Also
     present is WILLIAM CAREY.

                          NORFOLK
            Well..?

     MARY stares at her husband..

                         NORFOLK
            Did he have you?

     MARY's eyes burn..

                          MARY
            Yes.

                         NORFOLK
            More than once?

     MARY stares daggers..

                         NORFOLK
            You'd better get used to talking about
            it. Once you sleep with the king, it's
            not a private matter any more.

                         MARY
            Yes. More than once.

     WILLIAM CAREY's face: a flicker of pain..

                         NORFOLK
            So he was satisfied?

                         MARY
            I believe so, Uncle.

                         NORFOLK
             ood. This is where our work begins.
            It's one thing to catch the king. Quite
            another to keep him.

     NORFOLK turns to SIR THOMAS, ignoring MARY as though she were a
     piece of livestock..

                         NORFOLK
            I want you to keep her spotless, hair
            washed every day. She must read all the
            latest books and be able to venture and
            defend an interesting opinion. She must
            know her music, must be energetic and
            entertaining - in company and in bed.
            That's how he likes his women. And if
            ever she's in any doubt as to how to
            conduct herself, or what to do next -
            she should simply watch the Queen. That
            woman kept him from straying for eleven
            years. And the effort almost killed her.

      ut SIR THOMAS has not heard. He is distracted. He watches from
     a palace window as, in a stableyard down below..

     GEORGE and FRANCIS WESTON return from riding together. The sound
     of laughter as they dismount, and hand their horses to the
     stable-boys..

     SIR THOMAS watches as GEORGE and FRANCIS walk back to the palace
     together. There's something in their manner, the intimacy
     between them..

     SIR THOMAS's smile fades.

     `Slap', HENRY spreads out a huge architect's drawing of a
     magnificent ship on a table. He sits with SIR THOMAS BOLEYN and
     the DUKE of NORFOLK.

                         HENRY
            The biggest warship in the fleet. Thirty-
            two guns and two hundred feet long, and

       she deserves. And if there's anything
       else I can do for YOU, my friend..as an
       expression of my gratitude..let me know.

                    SIR THOMAS
        s it happens..there is one thing.

                    HENRY
       Name it.

SIR THOMAS has clearly not stopped thinking about what he saw
between GEORGE and FRANCIS WESTON..

                    SIR THOMAS
        ur son, George. He's of an age now..

                    HENRY
       You want me to make him a match?

SIR THOMAS bows. Deadly serious..

       Yes, your Majesty.

                    HENRY
       Do you have anyone in mind?

                    SIR THOMAS
       There is one lady, Sir..

                    HENRY
       Go on..

                    SIR THOMAS
       Who I fear is too high-born for us. And
       following the unfortunate matter between
       Anne and Henry Percy, I didn't want my
       children to overreach themselves again..

        verreach themselves?

HENRY can't help smiling..

                    HENRY
       One is currently in the King's bed. If
       they are good enough for me, I suggest
       they're good enough for anyone else.

            I beg you, Father. No.

                         SIR THOMAS
            She's well connected, her father is
            cousin to the King. And there's money,
            too.

                         GEORGE
            But must I actually...marry her?

                         SIR THOMAS
              thought you had ambitions for this

                         SIR THOMAS
            Then my advice would be to start
            behaving like a man. A real man. Do I

     MUSICIANS play. We're at GEORGE's wedding. Attended by the KING
     and QUEEN, all the senior LORDS. It's a markedly grander and
     posher affair than MARY's earlier wedding, a clear indication of
     the BOLEYNS' new, elevated status.

A formation dance is in progress. At the centre of it: GEORGE
dances with a radiant, triumphant JANE PARKER. GEORGE's eyes
meet those of FRANCIS WESTON across the room.

 y contrast: HENRY dances with MARY. A couple with eyes on for
each other. Locked to one another. Blissfully unaware of and
uninterested in anyone else. Silently counting the minutes
before they can tear off one another's clothes..

 EVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL:

Their intimacy is witnessed by WILLIAM CAREY, who we notice is
now drinking heavily, drowning his jealous sorrows..

ELSEWHERE:

SIR THOMAS BOLEYN is dancing with his wife, LADY ELIZABETH. He
hisses through a fixed smile..

                    SIR THOMAS
       For God's sake, it's the wedding of our
       youngest child attended by the King of
       England and the greatest Lords in the
       Land. Would a smile be too much to ask?

                    LADY ELIZABETH
       What's to smile about? I'm a mother with
       one child on his wedding day looking
       like he's been condemned to death.

 he indicates GEORGE, who dances with JANE PARKER..

                    LADY ELIZABETH
       Another banished abroad, in disgrace.
       And a third whoring in public with an
       adulterer.

                    SIR THOMAS
       For the moment she's happy.

SIR THOMAS watches MARY who dances with the KING..

                    LADY ELIZABETH
       But will she be happy when he leaves
       her? Because you know that's how it will
       end.

                    SIR THOMAS
       Only God knows how anything will end.

                    LADY ELIZABETH
       God..? He turned his back on all this a
       long time ago.

SIR THOMAS stares coldly at his wife. He applauds as the dance
comes to an end.

     IN ANOTHER CORNER:

     MARY and the KING also clap. HENRY whispers sexily in MARY's
     ear. She laughs. Then HENRY is called to one side...

     MARY is momentarily left alone. She looks up to see WILLIAM
     CAREY standing in front of her, swaying slightly.

                         WILLIAM
            You're in love with him, aren't you?

                         MARY
             illiam, you're drunk.

                         WILLIAM
            How is it? With him?

     MARY stares - suddenly hard - punishing him.

                         MARY
            He pleases me. Is that what you want to
            hear?

                         WILLIAM
            What does he do to you? Tell me. I want
            to know..

     MARY pulls away. But CAREY pulls her roughly to one side. HENRY
     sees this from across the room..

                         WILLIAM
            I know you look at me with contempt.
            But I had no choice. Your father
            insisted I stand aside. What was I
            expected to do?

                         MARY
            Say `no', husband.
                   (a beat)
            That was all you had to do.

     MARY pulls her arm away, and goes. She walks across the room,
     visibly shaken, and joins the KING.

     HENRY and MARY make love. Two people giving everything of
     themselves..

     Hours later: they lie together, enveloped in one another's arms.
     MARY is awake. The King asleep in her arms. She lovingly strokes
     his hair. Watches him breathe.

     Her face is glowing. Content. And the look in her eyes tells us
     more eloquently and unequivocally than any sonnet..

     The sound of groaning. Wretching. Shooting through a half-open
     door, we see MARY hunched over her basin, vomiting.
     P
      resently, she emerges from the bathroom. White-faced. Her hands
     instinctively covering her belly.

     MARY's eyes widen with the implications.

     SIR THOMAS BOLEYN and the DUKE of NORFOLK stare at MARY. Also
     present are several PHYSICIANS and GEORGE BOLEYN..

                         SIR THOMAS
            Are you certain?

                         MARY
            Yes.

     SIR THOMAS looks at the PHYSICIAN, who nods..

                         SIR THOMAS
             n that case...I suppose...someone
            should tell the King.

     Shooting through a half-open door..

     SIR THOMAS and the DUKE of NORFOLK are having a private audience
     with the KING. SIR THOMAS whispers something in HENRY's ear..

     (WE DO NOT HEAR THE WORDS - WE DO NOT NEED TO).

     HENRY's face breaks out in a smile. He delightedly shakes SIR
     THOMAS's hand. OVER THIS: the sound of a voice..

                         SIR THOMAS (O.S.)
            Keep them shut...still shut..

     A blindfolded MARY is led through doors by SIR THOMAS..into a
     suite of grand, unfurnished rooms, the most prestigious
     accommodation at court..

                         SIR THOMAS
            Now open!

     MARY removes her blindfold. She gasps in disbelief, turns 360
     degrees, staring at the size, and grandeur of the location..

                         SIR THOMAS
            There's more. Thanks to you, I am to
            become an Earl. Your brother a Viscount.

      EORGE smiles at MARY, who's eyes widen..

                         SIR THOMAS (cont'd)
            In addition, we have received a number
            of new grants and estates.
                    pointedly, to LADY
                    ELIZABETH)
            So our debts are paid off.

     But LADY ELIZABETH remains granite-faced..

                         LADY ELIZABETH
            Just be aware. These `gifts', this
            `favour' can go as swiftly as it comes.
            These rooms belonged to the Duke of
            Buckingham. Once the King's closest
            friend. Now his head rots on a spike..

                         SIR THOMAS
            Because he committed treason.

                          ADY ELIZABETH
            But what is `treason'? It's anything the
            King or his lawyers decide it to be.
            Anything that offends him, or causes him
            displeasure.
                    a beat)
            And can you assure me we'll never do
            that?

     LADY ELIZABETH turns and walks out. MARY looks anxiously at SIR
     THOMAS, who gestures dismissively..

                         SIR THOMAS
            Pay her no heed..


     INT. MARY'S BEDROOM - DAY

     MARY wakes up. She gets out of bed. She goes to the window and
     draws the curtains.

     Then MARY looks down, and gasps. The floor has fresh drops of
     blood on it.

     MARY goes to her bed, and rips back the sheets. Her eyes widen
     in horror. There is blood all over the sheets.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

     MARY covers her mouth. Lets out a loud cry. The sound of
     approaching footsteps as SERVANTS come running..


     INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY
65                                                                65
     MARY lies on the bed being examined by several PHYSICIANS. SIR
     THOMAS and the DUKE of NORFOLK look on in concern. Finally, the
     PHYSICIAN turns, washing his hands..

                         PHYSICIAN
            Happily, the baby lives. She's not
            miscarried.

     SIR THOMAS's face. Overcome with relief..

                         PHYSICIAN
            But the placenta is weak. For the sake
            of the child..

     The PHYSICIAN clears his throat. This will not be easy..

                         PHYSICIAN
            She must begin her lying-in immediately.

                           MARY
                     (horrified)
            What?

     MARY looks up. Her heart sinks.

                         MARY
            But I'm only three months..


66                                                                66
     INT. MARY'S BEDROOM - COURT - DAY

     MARY lies in her bed, watching with a forlorn expression as
     MIDWIVES and MAIDS prepare the apartment for lying-in.

      APESTRIES with soothing biblical images are hung on the walls.
     CURTAINS are drawn for darkness. A large CRUCIFIX is placed in a
     corner.

     As each TAPESTRY is hung, the room becomes darker...

     ..and darker.

     ..and darker.

     MARY cranes her neck to remain in sunlight for as long as
     possible, but before long..

     ..her face slips into darkness, and the room into total silence.
     And effective imprisonment.

     Darkness. The KING stands at the foot of MARY's bed. He is
     clearly uncomfortable in these `maternal' surroundings..

                         HENRY
             ou poor girl. All alone in here. But
            the time will fly by.

                         MARY
            Will it? It's six months?

                         HENRY
            I know. But the most important thing is
            a healthy child.

      ENRY takes MARY's hand..

                         HENRY (cont'd)
            I'll come and see you as often as I can.

     INT. COURT - DAY

     The KING's birthday. The MASTER OF REVELS has organised a lavish
     ball. The entire court is assembled and dancing, but HENRY
     appears sullen, distant. Unable to celebrate.

     He misses MARY.

      he QUEEN has several of her prettiest SPANISH LADIES-IN WAITING
     surrounding the KING. Giggling, fragrant butterflies.

     But HENRY shows no interest.

     The DUKE of NORFOLK notices this. A flicker of concern.

     An archery competition is in progress. But HENRY pays no
     attention. He sits listlessly to one side. Ill-tempered and
     missing MARY.

      mong the GUESTS are SIR JOHN SEYMOUR and his CHILDREN. They
     notice the KING, all alone. They talk among themselves.

     Sensing an opportunity, SIR JOHN SEYMOUR advances, and presents
     his pretty daughter JANE to the KING.

     The DUKE of NORFOLK, (never far away), notices how modestly and
     demurely young JANE SEYMOUR flirts.

     She has been well trained.

     But she makes no impact on HENRY. He waves the SEYMOURS away.
     Not remotely interested.

      or the moment.

     The KING is visiting MARY. He sits by her bed. They hold hands
     and are talking intimately.

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

     This is being watched by the DUKE of NORFOLK, and SIR THOMAS
     BOLEYN. NORFOLK's face is dark and brooding..

                         NORFOLK
            For the moment he's still visiting Mary.
            But for how long? The Queen will soon
            have his head spinning with pretty
            little Spanish things. Not to mention
            the Seymours with that girl of theirs.

     NORFOLK looks up...

                         NORFOLK
            What we need is someone from OUR family
            who will keep the King focused on Mary,
            reminding him of her while she is
            absent.

     SIR THOMAS is about to speak, then changes his mind.

                         NORFOLK
            What? Speak..

                         SIR THOMAS
            It's just...I was going to suggest Anne.

                         NORFOLK
            You couldn't control that girl last
            time. What makes you think it would be
            any different now?

                         SIR THOMAS
            I've had favourable reports from the
            Dowager Queen in France. It seems she is
            quite changed.

     MARY sits up. Her eyes widen in horror..

                         MARY
            Why?

     Sitting beside her in the darkness, is her brother GEORGE..

                         GEORGE
            I suppose they felt three years of exile
            was punishment enough.

                         MARY
            But the King visits me every day.
            There's no need for her. Or anyone else.

                         GEORGE
            They just want to protect you. Leave
            nothing to chance.

                         MARY
            But in who's interests do they imagine
            Anne will act? Certainly not mine.

     GEORGE turns, looks all around him..

                         GEORGE (cont'd)
            Why DO they make this room such a
            dungeon? Does it really need to be this
            dark?

     GEORGE notices MARY's vexed expression..

                         GEORGE
            Don't worry. She's had three years to
            forgive you. And she's not going to risk
            being sent away again. She'll do as
            she's told, I'm sure.
                   (a beat)
            Besides, the most important thing is..

     GEORGE moves MARY's lips into an upward shape..

                         GEORGE
            The three of us will be together again.

     MARY's lips: a reluctant, unconvincing smile..

     A dinner at court. HENRY is at one end, in serious conversation
     with foreign AMBASSADORS. Presently, at the other end of the
     table, loud laughter.
     H
      ENRY looks up, then returns to his conversation.

     It's not long before another loud gale of laughter in the corner
     of the room. HENRY looks up again. Then returns to his
     conversation.

      resently, a third roar of laughter at the other end. This time,
     HENRY loses patience..

                         HENRY
            What's the noise? I can hardly hear
            myself think!

     At the other end, a COURTIER gets to his feet..

                         BRANDON
            It's Mistress Boleyn, your Majesty. Her
            stories about life at the French court.
            They are particularly amusing.

     HENRY's expression changes. The room falls silent..

                         HENRY
            I'm only aware of one Boleyn girl and
            she is lying-in with a certain child in
            her belly!

SIR THOMAS BOLEYN gets to his feet..

                    SIR THOMAS
       It's my elder daughter, Anne, your
       Majesty. She has returned to court.

                    HENRY
       What? That awful girl, Thomas? The one
       that almost killed me?
              (a beat)
       You allowed her back?

                    SIR THOMAS
       The time abroad has done her good, your
       Majesty. I'm certain you'd find her much
       improved.

                      HENRY
       Really..?

HENRY looks down the table..

                    HENRY
       Well, come on. Where are you, other
       Boleyn girl? Show your face.

ANNE slowly gets to her feet. HENRY looks up. When he sees
ANNE's face, his face falls..

ANNE is a woman transformed. Gone are the simple clothes, puppy
fat and lack of confidence.

ANNE has become a glorious, head-turning siren; dressed in
daring French clothes.

 er hood is half-crescent, and reveals the hair. Her neckline
plunges sexily. Her sleeves are long and loose, offering daring
flashes of arm and elbow..

Like every other red-blooded MAN in the room, HENRY is utterly
mesmerised. Speechless..

                    HENRY
       So? What is so amusing, Anne? Perhaps we
       might hear and judge for ourselves?

ANNE dark, intelligent eyes stare back at HENRY. Suddenly, all
sound fades, and the world shrinks around them: it's as though
they are the only two people in the room..

                    ANNE
       I was just giving my thoughts on the new
       French King.

                      HENRY
       Which are..?

       That for someone with such great wealth,
       and power..he has surprisingly little
       authority as a man.

                    HENRY
       Hah!

                    ANNE
       And is SO consumed by one particular
       rivalry he can barely think.

                    HENRY
        eally? And who is this rival?

                    ANNE
       A neighbouring King, who's name one is
       forbidden to mention at court. Whose
       reputation haunts him in his thoughts
       and dreams.

 ipples of laughter, as people guess..

                    ANNE
       Whose armies and navy thwart his every
       endeavour. Whose physical and
       intellectual endowments are known far
       and wide.

 ENRY laughs too. Enjoying this..

                    ANNE
       In order to restore his confidence, this
       French King spends a fortune on anything
       that glitters, on building of castles
       with large towers..

ANNE artfully gestures the phallic implications..

                    ANNE
       But these symbols of wealth and virility
       fail to convince. Talk among the ladies
       at court in France suggests..
A
ANNE stops herself...

                    HENRY
       What?

                    ANNE
       That in this department too, the King
       has his shortcomings.

ANNE's gesture, (discreetly wiggling her small finger). HENRY
stares for a moment. A deathly silence. Has she gone too far?

     Then HENRY smiles. Delighted. DOGS bark in bewilderment. Soon
     everyone in the room laughs too.

     THOMAS), who glower, mute, at the end of the table beside their

     SIR THOMAS beams with excitement and satisfaction...

                         SIR THOMAS
            You should have seen the Seymours! Their
            faces!

     MARY lies in bed. Sitting by her side is her father..

                         SIR THOMAS
            They must have thought that with you out
            of the way, they had a real opportunity
            with that pale-faced thing of theirs,
            Jane...

     SIR THOMAS smiles as he remembers..

                         SIR THOMAS (cont'd)
            But Anne put pay to that. Last night,
            the King only had eyes for us Boleyns.

     MARY shoots a private, knowing look..

                         MARY
            Or HER, you mean.

                         SIR THOMAS
            What?

                         MARY
             'm wary of any suggestion that Anne
            would serve anyone but herself. France
            can't have changed her THAT much.

                         SIR THOMAS
             n this occasion I am quite satisfied
            she was being loyal to you.

                         MARY
            Really?

     MARY stares hollow-eyed..

                         MARY (cont'd)
            Then ask yourself this. If she is really
            so concerned for my well-being...

     AFTERWARDS: HENRY and his COURTIERS, (among them GEORGE), are
     being undressed and washed by their PAGES and SQUIRES..

                         HENRY
            You're a fortunate man, George. To be
            blessed with G
                         two such sisters.

                            EORGE
            Yes, my Lord.

     There is a powerful physicality, a sexual confidence to HENRY
     which he exudes, even among men. He moves closer to GEORGE.

                          ENRY
            Tell me. Are they as different in temper
            as they are in looks?

                         GEORGE
            Oh, yes. Each has her own, quite
            distinct virtues. Mary for example..

                         HENRY
            I'm familiar with Mary's. Tell me about
            Anne's.

                         GEORGE
            Anne? Well, she's strong. Some might say
            `difficult'.

                          ENRY
            Headstrong. With a fiery temper.

                         GEORGE
            But with it comes great passion, too.
            It's both the best and the worst thing
            about her.

            There are no half measures with Anne.

                         HENRY
            Careful, you'll make me think I chose
            the wrong Boleyn girl.

                         GEORGE
            Oh, no. I'm certain Mary is the   right
            choice. You will have a serene,   happy,
            life with her. The risk is with   Anne, it

            summer storm.

                         HENRY
            Is that so..?

     GEORGE has tried to put HENRY off. But might just have said the
     wrong thing.

                          ERVANT
            From the King, madam.

     ANNE looks at the box. Her heart misses a beat. It carries the
     unmistakable royal seal.

                          ANNE
            Open it.

     A SERVANT stares..

                         ANNE
            I said `open it.'

     The SERVANT opens it. Other SERVANTS crane their necks, stand on
     tiptoes. Inside is a large pearl pendant. The SERVANT gasps.
     ANNE, too. Covers her mouth. It's beautiful..

     But from somewhere, she manages to find the strength..

                         ANNE
            Now close it again. And send it back.

     The SERVANT stares in disbelief..

                         ANNE (cont'd)
            You heard me.

     The SERVANT bows, and leaves, taking the box. ANNE watches, a
     look of mischief in her eyes. She's up to no good.

     The KING bursts in. Everyone leaps to their feet. SERVANTS stop

     MARY's bedroom, and stare anxiously as the labour begins in
     earnest..

                           SIR THOMAS
              Does the King know?

                                                        64.


                    GEORGE
       He's on his way.

ANNE, who overhears this, surreptitiously adjusts her dress.

MARY screams in agony. The labour is well and truly under way.
Medically, it's a primitive, brutal affair..

No comprehension of sterilisation. MIDWIVES have dirty hands.
PHYSICIANS use rusty, blood-stained instruments..

Presently: the KING arrives with several COURTIERS..

                    SIR THOMAS
       Any moment, your Grace.

But the KING hasn't heard. He has seen ANNE. Suddenly, it's as
if all sound, all vision disappears, except for ANNE. He stands
beside her..

All around them the violence and dramatic activity of the birth
unfolding; but for all their connection with it, HENRY and ANNE
might as well be in a rose garden..

                    HENRY
       Anne..

ANNE stares ahead at MARY's bed..

                    HENRY
       Anne, I love you..

                    ANNE
       Your Grace, this is not the time..

                    HENRY
       I love you Anne. I cannot stop thinking
       about you. I cannot eat, I cannot
       sleep..

                    ANNE
       But how could I ever TRUST you?

NORFOLK cranes his neck to listen..

                    ANNE
       When I have seen how you have betrayed
       first your wife. And now my sister.

HENRY takes ANNE to one side...

                    HENRY
       I vow from this moment forth I will
       never lie with my wife, or speak to your
       sister again. I will do anything you
       ask..

                                                           65.


MARY's contractions build. Birth is imminent. PHYSICIANS and
MIDWIVES work to deliver the baby. ANNE thinks, then..

                    ANNE
       Then don't acknowledge the child.

HENRY is thrown..

                    HENRY
       What?

With a blood-curdling scream, MARY finally gives birth. SIR
THOMAS and NORFOLK crowd into the room, anxious to see..

                    PHYSICIAN
       A boy!

SIR THOMAS turns towards HENRY, beaming with happiness..

                    SIR THOMAS
       It's a boy, your Majesty. A strong,
       healthy boy.

HENRY's face: a boy? His eyes fill with emotion. This is what he
has waited for. A son.

ANNE notices his conflict, and prompts him again..

                    ANNE
       What my sister has given you, I could,
       too.

HENRY looks at the BABY, then turns to face ANNE. His eyes are
full of conflict, then..he silently nods.

ANNE's face breaks out in a smile..

                    ANNE
       Very well.

Then, in front of everyone, not caring how inappropriate it is,
HENRY falls to his knee, takes ANNE's hand and kisses it.

The audible sound of gasps. MARY watches in horror as HENRY
falls to his knees and kisses ANNE's hand..
                     M
                    MARY
              (a dagger in her heart)
       Henry..?

HENRY gets to his feet, then turns and walks away without
looking in the direction of MARY or the BABY.

                    MARY (cont'd)
       My Lord..?

MARY stares after the KING, but he does not turn around.

     Instead, MARY's eyes meet ANNE's.

     ANNE's eyes stare back. The ultimate moment of revenge.

       barely perceptible smile of satisfaction, then ANNE turns and
     goes.

     The MIDWIVES and PHYSICIANS stare at one another, visibly
     embarrassed by what they have just witnessed.

     The clearing of throats, averting of eyes. Then they get on with
     their work to the sound of the MARY's cries..


     INT. SIR THOMAS'S STUDY - NIGHT

     `Crash', SIR THOMAS and NORFOLK burst into the study, angrily
     slamming the door closed behind them. ANNE is inside.

                         NORFOLK
            Damn you! Three years we've been working
            on this! Not a single detail was left to
            chance! And now, in the moment of our
            greatest glory..

     NORFOLK stares at ANNE..

                         NORFOLK
            All I can say is you'd better have a
            plan. And it had better work.

     ANNE stares back defiantly..

                         ANNE
            Or what...Uncle?

                         LADY ELIZABETH
            Stop it! Both of you. What shall we do
            about Mary? And the child? Or have we
            forgotten them already?

                         ANNE
            Mary should go back to her husband.

     Not a flicker of emotion on her face.

                         ANNE
            She has been inconvenienced long enough
            by this family.

                          ADY ELIZABETH
            Fine. Then you can be the one to tell
            her.

      ADY ELIZABETH stares at ANNE..

                          LADY ELIZABETH

      ANNE stares into the room through a crack in the doorway.

      A flicker of doubt. What has she done? To her own sister?

      ANNE checks herself. Enough sentiment. She swallows it.

       nd enters.


      INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY

      MARY looks up as ANNE enters, and freezes..

                          MARY
             How can you show your face in here?

                          ANNE
             I understand you're angry - but be
             assured. I did nothing, except remind
             him of you.

                          MARY
             Oh, spare me. You did this deliberately.
             As revenge.
                    (a beat)
             And now you have what you wanted you
             probably think justice has been done.

                          ANNE
             Well, hasn't it?

                          MARY
             Be careful, that's my advice. Learn from
             my experience. Because he'll only do to
             you what he has done to me.

                          ANNE
             Never. I'll make sure he understands I'm
             a greater thing by far. That he can
             never have me until he makes me a far
             greater offer.

                          MARY
             You'll never get Henry Percy back, if
             that's what you mean.

                          ANNE
             That's not what I mean.

      ANNE's eyes burn with anger..

                          ANNE
             And don't you ever mention his name to
             me again. I'll never forget how you
             betrayed me.

                          MARY
             If that's what you think, fine. Tell
             yourself that.

                          ANNE
             I did, sister. Every day for three
             years.

      ANNE turns, and walks out.

      MARY is leaving COURT. Pale. Weak. Her belongings have been
      packed into boxes. Ahead of her, the BABY is being carried by
      MIDWIVES, led by WILLIAM STAFFORD.

      MARY walks across a courtyard, then stops in her tracks.

       VER BY THE STABLES: the KING and ANNE are mounting horses to go
      riding together. HENRY lifts ANNE up into the saddle behind him,
      (how she has learned!). ANNE holds tight, her arms wrapped
      around his waist..

      At that moment, ANNE looks over and sees MARY. Their eyes meet.
      They stare for a beat, then..

      ANNE kicks HENRY's horse, `Hah!', and they ride out. Galloping
      into the distance.

      MARY's face: fighting to hold onto her dignity. WILLIAM STAFFORD
      watches her, his eyes burning with sympathy.

      REVERSE ANGLE: to reveal, this is all being watched by QUEEN
      KATHERINE, from a palace window above..

      QUEEN KATHERINE turns, and coldly lets the curtain drop..

      MARY and her entourage travel through the countryside in a small
      caravan of horses and wagons. It's raining heavily.

      The rain continues. MARY's carriage approaches the manor house.
      At one time this was everything she wanted. Now it's a prison.


      INT. MANOR HOUSE - NIGHT

      MARY sits at the dinner table with her husband, WILLIAM CAREY,
      who's health has deteriorated. He drinks heavily. A shadow of
      his former self.

      He stares at the BABY..
                           W
                          WILLIAM

                            WILLIAM
             I see.

      A painful smile..

                          WILLIAM
             And is he to take my name? Or is he to
             be a Fitzroy or some other sign that he
             is a royal bast...

                          MARY
             He is to be Henry Carey.

                            WILLIAM
             I see.

      A silence, then..

                          WILLIAM
             Well, then, here we are.

      WILLIAM stares at MARY. Clearly still in love with her.

                          WILLIAM
             I could pretend none of this ever
             happened. Start again.
                    (a beat)
             If you could.

      MARY's face. Manages a brave smile.

      MARY lies in bed, her eyes open and staring blankly at the moon
      outside, as WILLIAM CAREY makes love to her.

      After a short, frenzied thrashing..he climaxes, then as before,
      rolls over and falls asleep.

      MARY stares at the ceiling.

      HENRY and ANNE walk through the gardens. Out of earshot of the
      entire court which is assembled outside..

                          HENRY
             Well, I have done what you asked. Will
             you give yourself to me, now?

             But it's not true. You are loyal to the
             QUEEN above all others.

                          HENRY
             My wife? I barely see her.

                          ANNE
             But she sits on a throne beside you.
             Accompanies you to every state function.

                           ENRY
             For appearance sakes only. In every
             other regard, our marriage is a sham.

             Still, she is your WIFE. And ever
             present. And I feel her eyes on me. And
             those of her spies.

      ANNE nervously looks left and right..

                          ANNE
             And look at us. Forever reduced to

      ANNE watches from a distance as HENRY talks to WOLSEY. We do not
      hear their dialogue, but the two MEN are having a heated
      discussion. Voices are raised.

      WOLSEY pleads with the KING to be reasonable. HENRY silences him
      angrily, then walks out..

      ANNE enters a lavish drawing-room, and sits down. She picks up a
      book, and pretends to be reading. HENRY enters, sidles up behind
      ANNE, putting his arms around her, then..

                          HENRY
             Wolsey has agreed to draw up plans for
             the Queen to be sent to a nunnery.

      HENRY kisses ANNE on the neck..

             She will protest, of course. She won't
             go quietly, but she knows she has failed
             to give me a son, and deserves her
             exile.

             So, is this assurance enough? Will you
             give yourself to me now?

      A flicker behind ANNE's eyes, then..

                          ANNE
             I'd like to. But I'm afraid I find the
             insult too much to bear.

                            HENRY
             What insult?

                          ANNE
             Because as long as we remain unmarried,
             any child I gave you would forever be
             daubed `bastard' and I a `whore'.

             My love for the Queen may have died, but
             even you must concede, she is still very
             much alive. A

                          ANNE
             Katherine of Aragon is alive. That woman
             is not worthy of the title `Queen'.

                           ENRY
             Oh, Anne.

                          ANNE
             I really do not know why we waste time
             talking of convents when you could annul
             the marriage.

                          HENRY
             Annul it?

                          ANNE
             That woman married two brothers and
             therefore sinned against God.

                          HENRY
             But she never consummated the marriage
             with my brother.

                          ANNE
             They were married six months.

                          HENRY
             Arthur was a sick man.

                          ANNE
             And Katherine is a shrewd woman who knew
             that her position as Queen would never
             be safe until she bedded your brother.

      ANNE sits in her study working. HENRY appears in the doorway.
      His face is dark. Conflicted.

                          HENRY
             Wolsey has agreed to charge the Queen?

                          ANNE
             But that's wonderful.

      ANNE's smiles, then notices..

                          ANNE
             Why do you look sad?

                          HENRY
             Because she will contest it. Which means
             putting her on trial. And hearing these
             delicate matters in public.

                          ANNE
              es. But any court made up of YOUR
             Bishops will surely find in YOUR favour.
             And declare the marriage invalid.

      Now it's ANNE's turn to start kissing HENRY round the neck..

                          ANNE
              hen you, my sweet Lord, will be free to
             remarry.
                    (sensing his arousal)
             Then I can give myself to you fully.
                     kissing him lower, lower..)
             And give you everything you..

      It's mid-winter. A lone RIDER appears on the snowy crest of the
      hill looking down on Rochford Hall.

       t's WILLIAM STAFFORD, (now bearded). He kicks his horse. Rides
      down towards the house.

      A fire roars. STAFFORD warms himself, staring at MARY's new baby
      daughter, (CATHERINE), in a a cot.

                           TAFFORD
             She's beautiful.

                          MARY
             Thank you.

                          STAFFORD
             I brought gifts from your family. A
             night-dress from your mother.
                    (to YOUNG HENRY)
             This from your Uncle George.

      STAFFORD produces a small wooded sword from behind his back.
      Little HENRY takes the sword. Swooshes it with excitement.

                          MARY
             Please be sure to thank them - though
             one wonders what's kept them so busy
             that not a single one of them found time
             to visit the new baby.

                          STAFFORD
             It's Anne. She's turning this country on
             its head. She has persuaded the king to
             test the validity of his marriage, and
             put the QueenM on trial.

                            MARY
             What?

                          STAFFORD
             She continues to hold out. Expertly
             witholding her favours until...

                          MARY
             ..until what?

                          STAFFORD
             Until he makes her the ultimate offer.

      MARY's eyes widen..

                          MARY
             High stakes indeed.

      MARY follows STAFFORD out to the stables where freshly watered
      and fed horses are waiting..

                          MARY
             And my brother George?

                           TAFFORD
             Continues to be promoted. As does your
             Father. I lost track of their latest
             titles.

      STAFFORD smiles. Mounts his horse..

                          STAFFORD
              ow is your husband? I heard he was
             unwell.

                            MARY
             He is.

                            STAFFORD
             I'm sorry.

      STAFFORD stares at her. Their eyes meet. STAFFORD opens his
      mouth, for a moment it looks as if he's about to finally declare
      his feelings, then..

                            WILLIAM (O.S.)
             Mary..!

      WILLIAM CAREY's voice calls out from inside. STAFFORD's
      expression changes. Now's not the right time.

      He kicks his horse, and rides off.


114                                                              114

      WILLIAM CAREY lying in bed, emaciated, coughing blood, weak and
      sick, calls out for help, `Mary!'

      INT. ROCHFORD HALL - CORRIDOR - DAY

      MARY walks down a corridor towards her husband's bedroom. As she
      goes, she passes a window. She stops. And looks out.

      In the distance is WILLIAM STAFFORD's horse. Reaching the brow
      of a hill..


      EXT. HILL - COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

      At that precise moment, WILLIAM STAFFORD's horse reaches the top
      of the hill..

                            STAFFORD
                      (pulling horse up)
             Whoa..

      STAFFORD turns, and faces back down at the house. He takes a
      last look. For a moment there is a connection between them both.

       hen, he turns, and kicks his horse, and rides over the brow.

      MARY watches him go, then stops - catches herself feeling
      something for the first time. Then she turns and walks along the
      corridor..

      ..back in the direction of WILLIAM CAREY's coughing.

      A hall filled with LAWYERS and AMBASSADORS from both sides.
      Arguably the grandest, most significant divorce proceedings in
      history.

      ANNE watches from a distance as HENRY talks to CARDINAL WOLSEY.
      Then HENRY turns. He walks towards ANNE.

                          HENRY
             The Queen has insisted a Papal
             representative be present at the trial.
             But Wolsey has assured me the trial will
             proceed for appearance sake only. We
             have our verdict.

                          ANNE
             Then what troubles you?

                          HENRY
             One or two friends have refused to lend
             their support. Among them, Thomas More.
                    (a beat)
             And then there's the small matter of my
             conscience.

                          ANNE
             Why? You have justice on your side.

      HENRY stares, conflicted..

                          HENRY
             Do I?

      ANNE strokes his head. Pacifying him. But the look on her face
      tells us - this is getting harder and harder.

      HENRY sits at breakfast. Reading official correspondence. Legal
      documents. And private letters.

       e sorts through the various scrolls, matters of state, then
      finds one. A letter in a hand he does not recognise.

      A quizzical look. HENRY cracks the seal and begins to reads the

             Mary Talbot!! The girl that married
             Henry Percy. It seems she has petitioned
             the King, demanding a divorce from her
             husband( on the grounds..
                     he can hardly bring himself
                     to say the words)

                    (his knuckles whiten)
             ..consummated.

             I must go to the King.

             No! He doesn't want to see you! Or hear
             a word from your lips! He's far too
             angry.

      A cemetery in mid-winter. WILLIAM CAREY's coffin is lowered into
      the ground. MARY, dressed in window's black, steps forward, take
      a shovel, throws earth on the grave.

      MARY walks back to comfort the CHILDREN. The elderly PRIEST
      continues with the service.

      MARY bows her head. Then she senses someone's eyes are on her.
      She looks up, and her expression changes..

      There is GEORGE. Her brother. Standing among the handful of
      mourners. Staring at her.

      The atmosphere is tense. Presently, the door opens, and MARY
      enters the room. In widow's weeds. All eyes on her. And her
      CHILDREN. A sharp intake of breath, a ripple of shock at the
      state of them. In simple country clothes. MARY curtseys..

      from penniless country widow to sophisticated courtier again.
      A
      ANNE enters, (unseen by MARY), and ushers everyone out. She
      takes the brush from the departing SERVANT, and continues to
      brush MARY's hair.

                          ANNE
              uch beautiful hair.

       earing ANNE's voice, MARY freezes.

                          ANNE
             Thank you for coming.

      MARY looks up. Notices ANNE's hands are shaking..

                          ANNE
             I hate how this matter has come between
             us. I wanted to come to see you after
             your daughter was born, and again when
             your husband died, but..

                           MARY
             It's fine.

      MARY pulls away. Raises her hand..

                          MARY
             Leave me. Please..?

      ANNE stares at MARY, her lips trembling..

                          ANNE
             I'm frightened, Mary. What have I done?

      MARY turns away. Avoids ANNE's eyes.

      The KING sits in his private apartment. He looks up as MARY
      enters, and curtseys deeply. Seeing MARY, his DOG
      enthusiastically greets her. Lapping at her.

      MARY looks at the KING. She is overcome with emotion, but finds
      the strength to hide it..

                          HENRY
             Ah! Mary! Come in.

      MARY walks closer.

                          HENRY
             Closer..
                    (beckons)
             Into the light.

      MARY walks closer. HENRY looks at her..

                          HENRY
             The Other Boleyn Girl. I'd forgotten how
             beautiful you were.

      MARY looks at him. Something has changed in him. A perceptible
      darkness around the eyes. A sadness..

                          MARY
              ou asked to see me, your Grace?

      The BOLEYN FAMILY members are pacing outside. Anxious. ANNE and
      SIR THOMAS exchange looks.

      FINALLY: the door opens.

      MARY emerges from the King's apartments.

       er entire FAMILY stares expectantly at her. ANNE steps forward,
      barely able to conceal her anxiety..

      MARY is putting the children to bed, tucking YOUNG HENRY in.

                           OUNG HENRY
             Mama? What's the matter?

      MARY's face: visibly upset. Her hands shaking.

                          MARY
                    (putting brave face on)
             Nothing.

      MARY smiles, tenderly kisses YOUNG HENRY.

      ANNE appears in the doorway. Watches through a half-open door.
      Notes how loving MARY is as a mother..

      MARY gets to her feet. Walks towards ANNE.

      MARY closes the door behind her. ANNE stares at her, then..

                          ANNE
                    (with difficulty)
             I am forever in your debt.

                          MARY
             You owe me nothing, sister. I did it
             that we may finally draw a line beneath
             everything that has happened between us.

                          ANNE
              hen let it be exactly that. A new start
             between us. Here at court.

      ANNE embraces MARY, who stiffens.

                          MARY
             Thank you. But I'd rather go back to our
             home in the country.

                          ANNE

             of everything here. They would grow up
             safe and secure.

      MARY stares, horrified. But before she can reply...

      The sound of a commotion, from outside. The sound of trumpets.
      The unmistakable noise of arriving SOLDIERS.

       veryone rushes to a window. Looks down to see a small ARMY.

       t the centre of everything: an grand, old, bearded ARCHBISHOP
      climbs down from an opulent carriage.

                           MARY
              ho's that?

                          SIR THOMAS
             The Papal Legate. Sent by the Pope to
             preside over the Queen's trial.

      MARY looks first at ANNE, then back out as the long procession
      dramatically enters the Palace Gates.

                          MARY
             So, it's true. It's really happening?

      ANNE suddenly looks pale. Vulnerable. Frightened.

                          ANNE
             Yes, it is. Stay with me, please? I need
             my sister by me side.

      A huge crowd is assembled. Despite the intimidating presence of
      the KING's GUARDS, the people shout vigorously in support of
      QUEEN KATHERINE. Crying out her name. The QUEEN arrives.

       ast cheers go up.

      We're in a packed courtroom. The room is filled with the
      country's highest-ranking bishops. To one side: ANNE and MARY
      watch from behind a screen..

MARY hears the CROWD's cheering for the QUEEN. Screams of
support and affection, `Long live Queen Katherine', `Our one
true Queen'. MARY looks anxious..

                    MARY
       The crowds are with her.

       The crowds have no vote.

       And the bishops that do are in Wolsey's
       pocket.

ANNE watches as KATHERINE enters court. The QUEEN sees ANNE, and
starts walking directly towards them..

                    ANNE (cont'd)
       God, she's coming towards us.

QUEEN KATHERINE walks towards the screen, reaches it, then
                     Q
pushes it aside, intimidatingly flanked by her LAWYERS..

                     UEEN KATHERINE
       So..the Boleyn whores. Two former ladies
       of mine. Hiding in shadows.

       What did I do to upset you, that you
       should turn against me like this?

                    ANNE
       You failed to give England an heir.

                    QUEEN KATHERINE
       And that upsets you so?

                    ANNE
       What upsets the King upsets me.

QUEEN KATHERINE straightens. Big mistake.

                    QUEEN KATHERINE
       How dare you!

       Katherine, Queen of England, come into

KATHERINE's LAWYERS try to drag her away from ANNE, but she
wrenches herself free..

                    QUEEN KATHERINE
        ou want me to creep away and become a
       nun? Well, I shall not. You want me to
       lie before God and admit my first

       a thousand years, not if you rack me to
       within an inch of my life...
              (beat)
       I am Katherine, Queen of England, the
       King's one true wife, and mother of the
       heir to the throne. Beloved of the
       people, and beloved of a King you have
       bewitched.

KATHERINE turns and enters the packed courtroom. She makes no
reply to the CRIER, instead walks over to where the KING sits,
and falls onto her knees..

MARY looks at ANNE, who is visibly shaking. And tries to compose
herself.

Throughout the courtroom, people exchange looks. Gasp. KATHERINE
is completely disregarding the court, Campeggio and Wolsey, and
appealing directly to her husband..

                    KATHERINE
       My Lord, how have I offended you? For
       twenty years, I have been a true,
       obedient wife. I have loved all those
       whom you loved, and given you children
       though it has pleased God to take them
       away. If there is any just cause that
       you can allege against me, I will
       happily depart to my shame and
       dishonour, but I tell you, as God is my
       witness, there is none.

 ENRY sits in silence, but can barely contain his rage.

                     ATHERINE (cont'd)
       So, I beg you, dear husband, to spare me
       this humiliation. But if you will not,
       and I am to be tried..

                    HENRY
              (defiant)
       You are.

                    KATHERINE
       ..then let it be in a proper court and
       by the only authority I recognise. His
       holiness himself.

An audible gasp from the court. HENRY shoots a look at WOLSEY,
`What?!?' WOLSEY is horrified, `I know nothing of this.'
KATHERINE gets to her feet, and dramatically walks out of the
court, stopping only to pause by a window..

      The cheers from the loyal PEOPLE who are waiting outside ring
      through the court. HENRY looks dark, thunderous. He storms out
      of court. WOLSEY watches, visibly shaken...

             Since it has pleased the Queen to absent
             herself from the court, the trial will
             simply proceed without her.

      A LAWYER gets to his feet. The trial begins..

      The entire BOLEYN FAMILY is assembled. ANNE paces up and down.
      MARY is with her children..

                          ANNE
             Wolsey promised the King his verdict.
             Instead he has humiliated him.

                          SIR THOMAS
             But they are continuing with the trial.
             And the Bishops will still find in the
             King's favour.

                          ANNE
             Yes. But without the Pope's blessing,
             the result will seem hollow.
                     a frustrated gesture)
             If only the King would take matters into
             his own hands.

                           ADY ELIZABETH
             And do what? His only option would be
             to reject the Catholic Church? And his
             faith would never allow it.

                          SIR THOMAS
             Nor his good sense. Breaking with Rome
             would isolate England politically. Leave
             us at the mercy of the Protestants.

                          ANNE
             But the alternative is leaving this
             country without an heir. Failing in his
             duty as a King. And risking civil war.

      HENRY, along with THOMAS CROMWELL and several of his LAWYERS are
      walking along a corridor. They turn a corner, then stop.

      HENRY freezes. He's seen something. And the impact of it has
      made him stop in his tracks.

      REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL:

      In the gardens outside, are ANNE and YOUNG HENRY, playing.

      The KING's face: it's as if all sound goes silent. He stares,
      transfixed, at the boy. He hears nothing except YOUNG HENRY's
      laughter. He sees nothing except YOUNG HENRY's golden locks.

      MARY watches from a distance, her heart cracking as HENRY
      dismisses CROMWELL and the LAWYERS, and goes out to join ANNE
      and YOUNG HENRY.

       t seems to have a profound affect on him..

      boy..

             Four, Sir.

      REVERSE ANGLE: to see MARY watching helplessly from inside the
      palace. Tears are streaming down her face. LADY ELIZABETH
      appears, and puts her arm round MARY's shoulders in comfort..

      OUTSIDE: in the gardens, YOUNG HENRY and his father continue to
      get to know one another..

             Now, `on guard'.

      HENRY and YOUNG HENRY begin to play fight. As they do, our

      The scene is being watched by:

      MARY, her nose pressed against a window in the palace, as she
      continues to watch HENRY play with her SON..

      From a window high up, we notice: QUEEN KATHERINE has appeared,
      too.

      HENRY continues to play with the boy. It's clearly a powerful
      emotional experience for him.

      Gradually, other FACES appear at the palace windows..

      First SIR THOMAS's. Then NORFOLK's. Then MARY's. Finally back to
      QUEEN KATHERINE..

      Watching on tenterhooks. Unsure how this will play out.

      QUEEN KATHERINE, screaming in protest, surrounded by wailing
      LADIES-IN-WAITING, is dragged roughly away from court by a unit
      of ARMED GUARDS..

                          KATHERINE
             How dare you!
                    (struggling)
             Take your hands off me..

      The GUARDS drag the QUEEN away, her heart-breaking kicking and
      screaming continues. As she disappears..

      We REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL: this is being watched shadows by the
      KING himself..

      His face: burning with guilt and self-loathing.

      The door flies open. ANNE is reading, alone. She looks up to see
      HENRY, his eyes ablaze..

                          HENRY
             Now you will give yourself to me.

      ANNE looks up..

                          ANNE
             I thought I had made myself clear. Until
             we are married, there is no questi..

                          HENRY
             Silence! Enough of your GAMES!
                    (tearing at her dress)
             I have torn apart this country for you,
             gone against every principle in my
             heart, I've endured the doubts and
             counsel of good men and silenced them
             with the axe...just to be with you..

      HENRY tears her dress. He forces himself on top of her.

                          HENRY
             Now prove to me it was worth the
             sacrifice.

      He pushes her back against a table, slamming her down, and
      enters her roughly. ANNE cries out in pain..

                          ANNE
             Stop, you are hurting me..!

      That night: ANNE is being groomed by MARY.

                          ANNE
             How was he with you? As a lover?

                          MARY

      ANNE's face. Haunted. Fearing the worst.

             No reason.

      A small ceremony. Held in secret. The distant sound of crowds
      protesting. Booing. Jeering. MARY watches from the shadows as
      ARCHBISHOP CRANMER marries HENRY and a visibly pregnant ANNE..

                          ARCHIBISHOP
                    (in LATIN, we see sub-titles)
             Do you, Henry Tudor, take Anne Boleyn as
             your lawful wedded wife..?

      HENRY's face: eyes burning with self-loathing..

                          HENRY
             I do.

      Their voices are almost drowned by the SHOUTS of protest and
      dissent coming from the streets..`Whore', `Witch'.

      MUSICIANS play in the corner, struggling to drown out the sound
      of the PROTESTERS.

A party is in progress. ANNE, the bride, is at the centre of
proceedings, visibly pregnant and finally Queen. But it has
brought her no peace. The cacophony from outside visibly
troubles her. MARY stands by her side. Maid of honour.

                    ANNE
       Did you hear? On the way to the church?
       They were calling me a witch.

                    MARY
       All that will die down as soon as they
       get to know you.

                    ANNE
       But what if it doesn't? What if they
       hate me forever?

                    MARY
       They won't. They will see how much the
       King loves you, and follow.

                    ANNE
              (haunted, hollow)
       How much the King loves me?

ANNE shoots an anxious look over at HENRY, who is with CROMWELL,
in the corner, lost in serious conversation..

                    MARY
        ister, I wonder if you've given any
       thought..to the matter of my returning
       to the country. With the children.

ANNE's face: her expression changes. Suddenly fearful.

                    ANNE
       What? No! I need you here more than
       ever. Besides, as the Queen's sister,
       you can't live alone out there like some
       gypsy. We need to make you a proper
       match.

 earing this, the passing WILLIAM STAFFORD freezes..

                    ANNE
       What about the Duke of Suffolk?

ANNE indicates an ugly, fat COURTIER..

                    ANNE
       All the ladies at court are mad for him.
       Or Lord Fardingly.
               indicates an OLD courtier,
               in his 60's)
       Marry him and you'd own half Scotland..

      MARY is walking back to her apartments, when WILLIAM STAFFORD
      runs after her, appearing in the corridor behind her..

                            STAFFORD
             Wait! Mary..

      STAFFORD catches her up..

                          STAFFORD
             I couldn't help overhearing. And before
             you agree to any of your sister's
             matches, let me just say..

      STAFFORD takes a deep breath. His heart racing..

                          STAFFORD
             ..I have saved money...not a lot...but
             enough. I've my eye on a place in the
             West...Tatton...near where I grew up..

      MARY turns, an incredulous look..

                            MARY
              hat?
                    (surely this is a joke)
             Stafford?

       TAFFORD blurts it out..

                          STAFFORD
             Mary...I love you. There..I've said it.
             From the moment I joined your family..

                            MARY
             Wait..

      MARY looks at him. A lightening flash of recognition. She's
      heard those words before, and puts two and two together..
                           M
                          MARY
             It was you, wasn't it? At the masked
             ball?

                            STAFFORD
             Yes.

                          MARY
             Oh, Stafford..

                          STAFFORD
             Mary..I have watched how your family has
             treated you.

             dying day..

                          MARY
             But it's impossible. You know that. Now
             Anne's Queen, my family would never
             allow it.

                          STAFFORD
             And you would CARE? What THEY think?
             After everything they have done to you?

       TAFFORD stares incredulously. Then goes.

      MARY's face. Lost in thought. STAFFORD's words still ringing in
      her ears. She sits at the foot of ANNE's bed. ANNE sits in bed.
      Heavily pregnant. On the other side is GEORGE.

                          ANNE
             God, I look hideous.

                             EORGE
             Does it hurt?

                          ANNE
             Little nips and stabs.

      MARY isn't listening. She is lost in thought.

                          GEORGE
             Just imagine. It it's a boy. The unholy
             trinity will be mother, uncle and aunt
             to the next King of England.

                          ANNE
             But if it isn't? The King will take that
             as evidence of God's displeasure. And
             will turn further against me. He's
             already become so cold.

      ANNE touches her stomach anxiously..

                          ANNE
             They say you can tell by the shape of
             the stomach. Mary, what do you say? Boy
             or girl?

      ANNE tails off when she sees MARY. Miles away.

                          ANNE
             What's the matter with her?

      MARY looks up, `What?'

      A darkened room. ANNE screams out. She is in the middle of
      giving birth. With a bone-chilling scream, a head appears..

                          MIDWIFE
             And again, one more..

      ANNE pushes again. MARY holds her. ANNE howls in agony. Her
      nails dig into the sheets. A last, primal, blood-curdling roar
      of pain..

                          MIDWIFE
             It's done, your Majesty..!

                            MARY
             Well done...

      PHYSICIANS and MIDWIVES swarm around the baby. ANNE, despite
      having lost a great deal of blood, tries to sit up..

                            ANNE
             And..?

                            MARY
             It's a girl!

      MARY takes the child from the MIDWIFE, holds it for ANNE.

                          MARY
             A beautiful, healthy girl.

      ANNE is overcome by maternal love, but realises what this will
      mean. She stares at the baby. Fear filling her eyes..

             A girl?

      MARY watches from a distance, as SIR THOMAS and NORFOLK tell the
      King. HENRY staggers from the disappointment, as if he had been
      delivered a blow..

                          SIR THOMAS
             She has named her Elizabeth. After your
             mother.

                          HENRY
             Is the child healthy?

                          SIR THOMAS
             Perfectly, Sir.

      HENRY stares, hollow-eyed. Finally..

                           ENRY
             Well, if we can have a healthy daughter,
             we can have a healthy son.

      HENRY turns, and without a word, pushes past everyone, and
      leaves. ANNE is left alone, her heart breaking..

      MARY stares at ANNE. A stab of compassion. Not long ago the same
      thing happened to her. Hoping to console ANNE, MARY hands her
      beautiful new BABY over to her...

      ..ANNE takes the BABY in her arms. Filled with love for
      something that will almost certainly mean her destruction.

      Her shoulders shake with tears.

                                                    FADE TO BLACK:

      ANNE stands by a window, staring out. Her hands wringing with
      anxiety. MARY is in another corner, tending to baby ELIZABETH..

                            ANNE
             Who is it?

      MARY leaves the BABY, goes over to the window. Looks out. Down
      below, HENRY is walking with an attractive young LADY..

                          MARY
             Lady Somerset, I believe.

                          ANNE
             Yesterday it was the wife of the French
             Ambassador. The day before with the
             Countess of Salisbury.
                    (a frustrated gesture)
             How could he DO that to me? So SOON?

      ANNE stares at MARY..

                          ANNE
             Now I know how it must have been for
             you.

      ANNE reaches for MARY's hand. Their hands touch. Briefly. Then
      MARY pulls away her hand, still not quite ready to forgive..

      And goes to tend to the crying BABY ELIZABETH..


      INT. MARY'S ROOM - COURT - NIGHT
148                                                            148
      MARY is with her children, reading them a bedside story. From
      next door, the sound of raised voices. The KING and ANNE are
      having a furious row. But MARY is not listening..

                          ANNE (O.S.)
             You can't ignore me like this. I am your
             wife! Why don't you just admit it!

                          HENRY (O.S.)
              ecause it's not true!

                          ANNE (O.S.)
             Liar! I can smell the whore on you! Get
             away from me! You disgust me!

       SLAP', the sound of someone being struck.


      INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
149                                                            149
      ANNE and MARY are together. ANNE is combing her hair. Strands of
      it come loose in her hands. Her eyes are hollow with stress. Her
      skin pale and covered in a film of perspiration..

                          ANNE
             I struck him today. What am I doing? I
             am destroying this all on my own..

      ANNE looks left and right. Makes sure no one is within earshot.
      Goes to check outside her door, then returns..

                          ANNE
             I can't sleep at night! And without
             sleep I cannot think!

             Oh, Anne..

                          ANNE
              nd it's getting more and more difficult
             to arouse him. Some nights he cannot do
             it...at all. I have to resort to ever
             more disgusting...then he hates himself
             in the morning...hates me even more for
             what I made him do...

      ANNE eyes stare. She rocks back and forth..

                          ANNE
             It's slipping away, Mary. I can feel it.

      MARY takes ANNE's hand. Envelops it in hers.

      The sound of ugly, loveless sex. Cries of pain. ANNE tries to
      keep the KING aroused. Demeaning, cruel, shaming, loveless sex.
1     HENRY repeatedly strikes her. Hating her. Hating himself.


 51                                                            151
      INT. MARY'S BEDROOM - PALACE - NIGHT

      In the neighbouring room: the ugly sounds of ANNE and HENRY's
      sex come through the walls.

      MARY covers her ears with a pillow, blocking out the noise, and
      escapes to the only safe world she knows. That of her dreams.


152                                                            152
      INT. ANNE'S BEDROOM - DAY

      SIR THOMAS BOLEYN, NORFOLK, GEORGE BOLEYN and MARY are watching
      intently as ANNE is being examined by several PHYSICIANS.

       nbearable tension. Finally a PHYSICIAN straightens, turns to
      face the FAMILY..

                          SIR THOMAS
             And..?

      The PHYSICIAN's face: he nods.

      A magnificent winter party to celebrate ANNE's pregnancy. The
      River Thames is frozen over. It's a lavish spectacle.

      Jousting on ice-skates, bear-baiting with dogs, MUSICIANS, skate-
      dancing, sledges and fire-eaters and Muscovite tumblers.

The KING threads his way through COURTIERS and ENTERTAINERS.
Wherever he goes, people stop their conversations, bow in fear.
Inimidated.

ANNE, visibly pregnant, sits on a throne. Alone. She looks
drawn, frightened, and tired. An unmistakable echo of QUEEN
KATHERINE at the masked ball earlier.

                     EORGE
       And so, it's come to this. Our sister is
       with child, and all England's fate is in
       the balance.

 EORGE indicates ANNE..

                    GEORGE (cont'd)
       If it's a boy, the King will have been
       vindicated in getting rid of his first
       wife, and his authority will be
       unassailable. But if it isn't. Or if,
       God forbid, she miscarries.

 EORGE indicates HENRY, who's face is also drawn, dark,
malevolent, suspicious. Barely recognisable.

                    GEORGE
       The King will have to move swiftly to
       silence his enemies. He will claim
       innocence. That he was corrupted. Anne
       will swiftly be replaced as Queen, by
       someone more `acceptable'.
              (a beat)
       And we Boleyns will never be able to
       show our faces at court again.

                    MARY
       That's no bad thing.

MARY shudders to herself. Holds her children protectively.

                    MARY
       Anyone with any sense would have run
       away from this hell-hole already. As far
       as they could go.

                    GEORGE
        ike the wise William Stafford.

MARY turns...

                    MARY
       What?

                    GEORGE
       You didn't know? Sold up and went. Left
       for the country. Just like that. Gone to
       live in some place called..

                    (under her breath)
             ..Tatton.

                          GEORGE
             Where he grew up, apparently. Did you
             know he came from a better stable than
             all of us? His grandmother was a
             Beaufort, cousin to the King. And he
             never mentioned it.
                    (shrugs)
             Who'd have guessed?

       EORGE shrugs, and skates off with FRANCIS WESTON. We pull back
      to reveal they are being watched by JANE PARKER..

      ..who looks drained. Lonely. Worn out by the humiliation of her
      failed marriage and the agony of unrequited love.

      INT. ANNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      `HAAARRGGH', ANNE bolts awake in the middle of the night. Her
      face is pale. She is covered in a thin film of perspiration. She
      flinches in pain. Holding her stomach..

      Immediately doors open, and several SERVANTS and LADIES appear.
      But ANNE composes herself.

                          ANNE
             I'm fine, thank you.
                    (visibly paranoid)
             Just a bad dream.

      Reassured, the SERVANTS fill ANNE's glass with water..

                          ANNE
                    (flinches as she speaks)
             But fetch my brother and sister, will
             you?

      The SERVANT bows, and goes. As soon as ANNE is left alone, she
      slowly looks down, and pulls back the bedsheets..
      W
       hen ANNE sees what lies beneath, she howls in horror.

      MARY and GEORGE arrive breathlessly in ANNE's room, to find..

      ANNE is on the floor before the fire, her arms wrapped around as
      if she were hugging herself. On the floor beside her is a
      bloodstained bundle of sheets.

      ANNE looks up through the trailing locks of her hair..

                    ANNE
       I lost it. Almost without pain. And so
       fast it was over in a moment.

MARY looks down at the bundle of sheets..

                    MARY
              (heart cracks)
       Oh, Anne..

MARY hugs ANNE tightly. All animosity now gone..

                    ANNE
        ou have to get rid of it. Bury it. Get
       rid of it somehow. No one must know.

 EORGE rushes to a cupboard, and pulls out a cape. He wraps it
around ANNE. Then he pours wine into a glass. MARY wraps ANNE in
a blanket to warm her. And begins making the bed with fresh
linen..

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

AN HOUR LATER: ANNE is composed. Staring into the fire. MARY and
GEORGE sit on either side of her.

                    ANNE
       It's not the first. Miscarriage.

MARY's heart cracks. Takes ANNE's hand.

                    ANNE
       They will take it as proof that I cannot
       bear children. That I am cursed by God.
       And should be dispensed with.

                    MARY
       Why? There's still time. You could sleep
       with the King, and fall pregnant again.
       No one would know..

                    ANNE
        he King would never lie with me now,
       and risk damaging the `child' he
       believes I'm carrying..
               a beat)
       Besides, he is barely capable anymore.
       And I couldn't go through that again.

ANNE stares at MARY and GEORGE..

                    ANNE
       No, if I am to survive..I have to take
       matters into my own hands.

MARY and GEORGE exchange blank looks..

       Must I spell it out?

                    MARY
       You mean lying with another man?

                      ANNE
       Of course.

                    GEORGE
       But that would be treason.

                    MARY
        esides, where would you find someone
       you could trust?

                    ANNE
       Obviously, it would have to be someone
       close. Very close..

                    ANNE
       Don't you see? This affects all of us.
       If I go down, so do all of you. The only
       way to save ourselves..is to do this..
              (a beat)
       And pray it's a boy.

MARY covers her mouth in horror, gets to her feet..

       I can't listen to this..
              (feeling nauseous)

       Mary, sit down..

                    MARY
       No, Anne! I understand you have had a
       shock tonight. A terrible shock. But
       there is no need for this..

      MARY leaves the room. Tears stream down her cheeks. She runs
      down the corridor, rushing towards her children..

      But as MARY goes, we REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL:

      A figure sits in the shadows by ANNE's door. Someone who has
      heard everything that has been said..

      ears, unable to listen to any more..

      MARY rushes into her room. She goes to the beds where her

      ANNE and GEORGE stare at one another. ANNE pours a mug full of
      mulled wine..

      ANNE takes the first step, and starts unbuttoning her brother's

      JANE PARKER gets to her feet. Numb with shock. She stares ahead.
      Momentarily loses her footing.

      Then disappears into the darkness.

      MARY arrives in a market village. She asks directions. Then
      kicks her horse. Rides on.

      A simple farmhouse, nestling in a valley.

      MARY stands in front of the door, protectively holding her
      children. A flicker of panic passes behind her eyes. What is she
      DOING? She knocks.

                          YOUNG HENRY
             Who lives here, Mother?

                          MARY
             Someone.
                    (clears throat)
             A friend.

       o answer. MARY knocks again. Still no answer. MARY hesitates,
      then tries the door. It opens..

      MARY enters, calls out, `Hello?'. No answer.

      Inside: it's warm, inviting, idyllic. The CHILDREN go to the
      kitchen table. Instantly feeling at home. MARY calls out..

                            MARY
             William?

       o answer.

                           OUNG HENRY
             Mama, I'm hungry.

                            CATHERINE
             Me, too.

      MARY stares. What should she do?

      MARY puts CATHERINE to sleep in a bed. YOUNG HENRY is already
      fast asleep in another bed. MARY draws the curtains.

       hen closes the door.

      MARY walks along a corridor. She looks in the bedroom.

      MEN's clothes in the wardrobe. No sign anywhere of a woman's
      presence. MARY turns, then catches sight of herself in a mirror.
      Her hair is bedraggled. Her clothes are filthy.

      MARY pours hot water into a bath. The room is thick with steam.
      She begins unbuttoning her dress.

      WILLIAM STAFFORD and several FARM-HANDS return from working in
      the fields. Talking and laughing. They reach a crossroads, go
      their separate ways. STAFFORD rides on for a while..

      ..then stops when he sees a horse outside his house.

      STAFFORD dismounts his horse. A quizzical look. Then he walks
      towards the front door.

      STAFFORD enters his house to see empty bowls of food on the
      table.

       HILDREN's boots by the door. And a WOMAN's riding cape.

       rom upstairs, the sound of splashing. STAFFORD expression
      changes. He slowly goes up the stairs.

       he sound of splashing gets louder. A WOMAN's voice. Humming.

      STAFFORD pushes open the door. MARY is in the bath. Washing
      herself. MARY looks up.

      MARY's eyes.

             I just didn't know where else to go.

      STAFFORD walks in. MARY gets up...

      No modesty. No shame. No effort to cover herself.

      STAFFORD sweeps her into his arms..

      No words. No explanations. Time for that later.

       hey fall into a passionate embrace, and sink to the floor..

      Time has passed. Winter has become spring. We're in an idyllic
      country church. MARY and WILLIAM STAFFORD are being married by a
      PRIEST.

                           RIEST
             Do you, Mary, take William as your

      A dance is in progress. MUSICIANS play. Fifty or so GUESTS.

      MARY is talking to a friend. In another corner: she notices a
      MESSENGER arrive. A former COLLEAGUE from court.

       e talks to STAFFORD. They talk gravely. STAFFORD's face is
      ashen..

      MARY excuses herself from her friend, crosses the room, goes to
      STAFFORD..           M
                           MARY
             What is it?

      ANNE is walking alone. Her MAIDS follow at a distance. Presently
      she lets out a cry. Her body doubles up in pain.

      Her MAIDS rush towards her.

                          STAFFORD
             They say it was deformed...monstrous.
             She is charged with incest and of
             summoning the devil. Your brother, too.
             He has already been sentenced. Anne is
             in the Tower, awaiting trial.

      ANNE in a prison cell at the Tower. Frightened. Vulnerable.

      MARY face: horrified.

                             MARY
             I must go.

      MARY turns to walk out. STAFFORD blocks her path..

                          STAFFORD
             And do what? George is doomed. For Anne
             it's only a matter of time.

                          MARY
             I can petition the King..

                          STAFFORD
              ou think he will listen? It's his own
             neck he's saving by getting rid of them,
             can't you see?

                          STAFFORD
             Fine, go. But if you do, you might as
             well kiss your children goodbye. You are
             Anne's sister. That alone makes you her
             accomplice and co-conspirator.

                          MARY
             I have no choice. Anne and George are my
             family. I cannot desert them.

      MARY walks towards the door..

                          STAFFORD
             And what of your new family? Your
             CHILDREN?

                          MARY

      ANNE is led into a great courtroom lit by flickering torches,
      and filled with fifty or sixty of the country's most powerful
      NOBLEMEN. ANNE walks to the centre of the room, surveying her
      `jurors', noting that they have remained seated..

                          ANNE
             It is a sad day for England when the
             nobles do not rise for their Queen.

                          NORFOLK
             And even sadder when that same Queen is
             charged with adultery and incest.

                          ANNE
             Charged is different to convicted,
             Uncle. Or is it not? In this court?

      Deathly silence. The clearing of throats. Then with much chair
      scraping, the NOBLES reluctantly get to their feet..

                          NORFOLK
             Master Cromwell, read out the
             indictment..

      CROMWELL gets to his feet..

                          CROMWELL
             The charge is that in the twenty-eighth
             year of the reign of our Sovereign
             Henry, King of England, his wife, the
             Queen, being seduced by the Devil, did
             knowingly commit adultery, high treason
             and offences against God.

                          NORFOLK
             How do you plead?

                          ANNE
             Not guilty, my Lord.

      horse. No thought of rest.

                           A
      ANNE faces the LORDS, as she makes her case..

                          ANNE
             My noble Lords..the love I have for my
             brother is the love any sister would
             have for someone with whom she has grown
             up in the same house, nursed when sick,
             played games as children, shared life's
             celebrations.

      As ANNE delivers this speech, our CAMERA slowly pulls back,
      back, towards the door..

                          ANNE
             That is the love I have for him. Not
             what you suggest.

      Our CAMERA pulls out through the door...

      ..and into a corridor beyond, where we find HENRY hunched in
      shadows, eavesdropping, his face cast in shadows..

                          ANNE (V/O)
             Judge me, my Lords, as you see fit. But
             never forget that your verdicts will be
             judged again by God, in the greatest
             court of all..

      HENRY's face is a study of guilt. His knuckles whiten, his nails
      dig into his hands..

                          NORFOLK (V/O)
             My Lords, the time has come to cast your

      ANNE watches on as each LORD takes it in turn to get to his
      feet, and deliver his verdict. First CROMWELL, then the
      SEYMOURS, then HENRY PERCY..

      The verdicts rain down on ANNE, `Guilty, guilty, guilty', going
      round the courtroom, until they reach the DUKE of NORFOLK. ANNE
      meets the eyes of her UNCLE..

                          NORFOLK
                    (unflinching)
             Guilty.

      NORFOLK stares at ANNE. Not a hint of compassion..

                          NORFOLK
             In which case, the burden falls on me to
             pass sentence.

      GEORGE BOLEYN's eyes are covered with a cloth. He puts his head
      on the block. A PRIEST says last rites as GEORGE's arms are held
      back. Terrified, his lips mouth prayers..begging forgiveness.

      The axe falls. A huge ROAR goes up.

      REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL: this has been watched by SIR THOMAS
      BOLEYN.


      EXT. TOWER OF LONDON - DUSK
192                                                              192
      MARY arrives in time to hear the ROAR from the crowds. She
      dismounts her horse, exhausted from the journey,

       he walks against a tide of CROWDS leaving. Drunk. Laughing.
      Talking among themselves.

      MARY's expression changes.

      Suddenly, a shiver goes down her spine. MARY feels sick. Fearing
      the worst, she goes up to a WOMAN in the CROWDS..

                           MARY
              ho was it?

      HENRY walks through corridors arm in arm with JANE SEYMOUR,
      followed closely by the SEYMOUR BROTHERS, SIR JOHN SEYMOUR and
      the ever-surviving DUKE of NORFOLK..

      HENRY turns a corner, then stops in his tracks when he
      sees...MARY waiting outside his Privy Chamber, restrained by
      GUARDS. Seeing the King, she curtseys deeply..

                           HENRY
             Mary..?

      The SEYMOUR BROTHERS draw their swords, but the KING's DOG runs
      excitedly towards her. HENRY gestures for the SEYMOURS to sheath
      their swords..       H
                            ENRY
             Leave us.

      The SEYMOURS leave. The DUKE of NORFOLK hesitates..

                           HENRY
             ALL of you!

      NORFOLK shoots MARY a look, then goes. HENRY turns and leads her
      into..

      His private room. His sanctuary. Where he took her before. The
      room to which only MARY seems to have had access..

                          MARY
             Your Majesty..
                    (falling into a deep curtsey
                     as HENRY closes the door
                     ensuring their privacy)
             I understand my family has offended you.
             But having taken my brother today, I beg
             you to spare my sister.

                           HENRY
             Oh, Mary...

                    MARY
       I realise you must replace Anne as
       Queen.
              (a beat)
       But must she die, too?

                    HENRY
       She has been tried and found guilty.

                    MARY
       You could send her away.

                     ENRY
       I am bound by the law.

                    MARY
       You could send her to a nunnery. No one
       would know.

                    HENRY
       Anne? To a nunnery?

HENRY almost manages a smile.

                    MARY
       There is precedent, my Lord. Louis of
       France did it, too. When his wife could
       not conceive.

                    HENRY
       The French Queen was a blameless woman.
       Your sister a witch.

                    MARY
       I understand Anne has offended you. I
       ask only that if there is any regret you
       might..feel yourself.

                     ENRY
       What?

                    MARY
       For your part in the matter..

MARY treads delicately. Realising the very suggestion is
treason.

                    MARY
       ..does not unduly colour your thinking.
       Killing Anne will not make it go away.
              (a beat)
       It would only make it worse.

 ENRY stares at MARY..

                    HENRY
       How could I have made that mistake?

      Suddenly his eyes are full of regret. And sadness.

                          HENRY (cont'd)
             Choosing her over you?

       ENRY thinks. A long silence.

                          HENRY
              o. I will reflect on the matter.

      MARY falls on one knee. Kisses his swollen, bejewelled hand in
      gratitude. HENRY stares, watching her as she goes.

      A team of CARPENTERS erect gallows and scaffolding. Hammers
      knock nails. A sickening metronome of death.

      OTack', `tack', `tack'.
       n the hill: a blood-stained chopping block is put into place.

      The doors to ANNE's cell open. ANNE looks up. In the doorway is
      MARY. MARY stares at ANNE..

      ANNE's appearance is shocking. She looks ten years older.
      Haggard and lined by stress.

      ANNE puts on a brave face, stares back at MARY.

                          MARY
             Oh, Anne..

      The two sisters walk towards one another, and embrace. Tight.
      Tears run onto each other's shoulders..

                          ANNE
             How has it come to this?

                          MARY
             Ssshhhhh.

      A LIEUTENANT gives a nod. SOLDIERS raise a barrier, and allow
      the CROWDS that have been waiting to rush forward.

       he CROWDS swarm over the grassy hill...putting down
      coats...reserving seats..anxious to secure the best views.

                                                             112.

      ANNE looks out through a narrow window. Her intense, fearful
      eyes flit and dart..

                          ANNE
             They're letting the crowds in.

                          MARY
             It's all right. You will be spared. The
             King as good as gave me his word.

                          ANNE
             The King saw you?

                             MARY
             Yes.

      ANNE manages a rueful smile..

                          ANNE
             We all made a mess of that, didn't we?
             We all underestimated little Mary.

      ANNE looks at MARY..

                          ANNE
             I don't think he ever stopped loving
             you.

                          MARY
             That's not true.

                          ANNE
             It is. He never loved me in the same
             way. And deep down you know it.

      MARY averts her eyes..

                          ANNE
             You should have been Queen. You even
             gave him a son. But instead all this has
             happened because..
                    (a beat)
             Because I couldn't bear to be the Other
             Boleyn Girl.

      ANNE shrugs..

                          ANNE
             And now look?

      The sound of approaching footsteps. ANNE looks at MARY, suddenly
      frightened..

                          ANNE
             Hold me..

      The two SISTERS fall into an emotional embrace as the JAILOR's
      keys turn in the lock..

                          ANNE
             You'll look after Elizabeth?

                          MARY
             It will be all right. Trust me.

                          ANNE
              he couldn't ask for a better moth...
                    (breaks down, composes
                     herself)

      MARY hugs ANNE tight..`Sssshhh'.

                          MARY
              e will spare you. I am sure of it.

      ANNE takes a deep breath. Tries to look serene..

      A roar of the crowd. ANNE, wearing a shawl of white ermine, is
      violently jostled and spat at as she's marched across Tower Hill
      to the scaffold. She shoots MARY an anxious look across the
      crowds..
      M
      MARY shoots a signal, "Don't worry." ANNE climbs the steps, and
      faces the CROWDS. Finally the jeers subside..

                          ANNE
             I...I come here to die...a loyal
             subject..

      More spit, jeers and abuse. MARY stands on tiptoe, cranes her
      neck. Anxiously scans the CROWDS for the GUARDS that will free
      ANNE..

                          MARY
             Come on..

                          ANNE
             ..I..I do not blame the King. Never was
             there a more just or goodly Lord..

      Presently, MARY sees two SOLDIERS pushing through the CROWDS
      towards her. Her heart leaps..

                          ANNE
             ..I beg God's forgiveness and his
             mercy..

      ANNE looks up to see the SOLDIERS reaching MARY, and handing her
      a letter. ANNE smiles in relief. MARY opens the letter and
      reads..

                          CROMWELL (V.O.)
             "Madam..."

      THOMAS CROMWELL, the former assistant to WOLSEY, who has now
      replaced him, sits at his desk, writing the letter..

                          CROMWELL (V.O.)
             ..the King has spared you because of his
             respect and affection for you and
             because you are the mother of his son."

      MARY continues to read the letter, as ANNE is forced to kneel by
      the EXECUTIONER..

                          CROMWELL (V.O.)
             "But you risked your life coming to
             court and you are advised you not to do
             so again. You will not be shown the same
             clemency a second time. Your sister Anne
             was tried and found guilty, her crimes
             were high treason and she deserves to
             die. Cromwell."

      MARY, who is reading, looks up in horror..

                          MARY
             No!

      ANNE looks up. She sees the look on MARY's face.

      MARY's eyes.

      ANNE's eyes.

      `WHOOSH', the masked EXECUTIONER swings his sword. ANNE is
      beheaded. MARY almost chokes..

      The CROWD falls eerily silent. A stunned calm descends on Tower
      Green. Nothing but the sound of the wind.

      MARY sways, then falls backwards, having lost consciousness. She
      falls, falls..but is caught by a strong pair of arms..

      ..WILLIAM STAFFORD, who has followed her to London.

      Suddenly the CROWDS burst into life. A great, bloodthirsty ROAR
      echoes around Tower Green as ANNE's head is lifted aloft..

      WILLIAM STAFFORD carries MARY in his arms. They walk against the
      flow, of teaming CROWDS, and newly-arriving FAMILIES coming to
      watch the spectacle..

	          None, there's nothing else, you know
	          how tight the market is.
	
	                     MEG
	          This is it?  I told you on the
	          phone, I have to be moved in in two
	          weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce
	          that here.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Mom, it's the sidewalk.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          Oh, that miserable little prick is
	          already leaving.
	
	They approach a row of brownstones, narrow four story
	townhouses, nice looking buildings, a hundred years old or
	more.  EVAN, a sour-looking man, has just locked the front
	door of number 26 and is coming down the steps.  He sees them
	coming.
	
	                     EVAN
	          One day you will learn to respect
	          other people's time, Lydia, one day
	          you --
	
	                     LYDIA
	          Evan, I am so sorry, you were a
	          saint to wait for us!
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  TOWNHOUSE - FOYER - DAY
	
	Evan throws open the front door, revealing the airy foyer of
	the townhouse.  The place is completely empty.  He talks
	fast, races through the tour.  The three of them come in,
	Sarah still bouncing her basketball.
	
	                     EVAN
	          This is the middle of the house, the
	          entry floor, living room's over
	          there.  The kitchen floor's below us
	          and there's two bedroom floors
	          above.
	
	The front door closes behind them, with a THUD so
	authoritative it seems to say no one's ever getting out.  Meg
	tries to get her daughter's attention, to tell her to stop
	bouncing the ball in the house.
	
	                     EVAN
	          It's an enormous amount of space for
	          the money and I'll be perfectly
	          honest, the family is in no hurry
	          whatsoever.
	
	Meg whispers Sarah's name, but Sarah still ignores her, goes
	on bouncing the ball.
	
	                     EVAN
	          I don't have to tell you there is an
	          acute shortage of living space in
	          Manhattan right now and this is a
	          highly unique property.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          No ball, kid.
	
	Sarah immediately stops bouncing.  She wanders into the
	living room, peers through the big French doors, which look
	out over the courtyard area.  There's another row of
	brownstones on the next block, and all the patios back up to
	one another.  It looks tranquil out there, oasis in the city.
	
	Sarah leans up against the door, sighs, her breath fogs the
	window.  There is a profound melancholy about her.  Meg
	watches her, tries to catch eyes with her in the reflection.
	Can't.
	
	Evan flings open the door of an old-fashioned cage-style
	elevator.
	
	                     EVAN
	          Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine,
	          the previous owner, was disabled the
	          last ten years of his life.  Highly
	          unusual, the elevator, you will not
	          find this in ninety percent of
	          brownstones.
	
	                     MEG
	          Will they take asking price?  I need
	          a two week escrow and I'm already
	          approved for the loan.
	
	Lydia turns, gives Meg an "are you insane?" look.
	
	                     EVAN
	          What say we see the house before we
	          dicker, hmm?
	               (starting up the stairs)
	          I have to warn you, this is exactly
	          the response we expected to get.
	          It's a very emotional property.
	
	As he disappears upstairs, Lydia turns to Meg, lowers her
	voice.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          Who taught you to negotiate?
	
	                     SARAH
	          It's not like Saks', Mom, you don't
	          have to pay the price on the tag.
	
	She gets in the elevator and RATTLES the door shut with a
	bang.  That kid's got an attitude.  Meg takes a deep breath,
	turns to Lydia.  She brushes her hair behind an ear, we
	notice her thin hand is shaking.
	
	                     MEG
	          I'm sorry.  Apartments, and...
	          money, and... this is more my
	          husband's area.
	
	She digs in her purse for a prescription pill bottle and some
	water.
	
	                     MEG
	          Was.  His area.  I'm not very good
	          at...
	
	Lydia watches as she swallows a pill, waiting for Meg to
	finish her sentence.  Not very good at what?
	
	                     MEG
	          Things, and if I can't prove to my
	          soon to-be ex-husband that I can
	          provide a suitable place for our
	          daughter to live in the next
	          fourteen days, it's going to get
	          ugly between us.  Uglier.
	
	Lydia just looks at her, no idea what to say.  These two are
	from different places.
	
	                     EVAN (O.S.)
	               (from upstairs)
	          It would be so lovely if I could
	          shot the property before I leave!
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  TOP FLOOR BEDROOM - DAY
	
	Evan, Lydia, and Meg poke their heads in a series of rooms,
	one after the other, the tour flying by quickly.  First, an
	upstairs bedroom.  Nice, roomy, looks out on the courtyard.
	
	                     EVAN
	          Top floor.  Two bedrooms, one
	          bathroom.
	
	INT.  DEN - DAY
	
	Another floor, another empty room.  The trio passes through.
	
	                     EVAN
	          Third floor, spare bedroom, den,
	          what have you.  Mr. Pearlstine used
	          it as an office.
	
	                     LYDIA
	               (low voice, to Meg)
	          He's talking about Bernard
	          Pearlstine.
	
	Meg shrugs, who's that?
	
	                     EVAN
	               (moving, through a
	                bathroom)
	          Master bath.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          The hotel guy?  It's been in the
	          papers lately.  His kids are all
	          suing each other over his estate.
	          He was a total recluse, paranoid,
	          rich as hell, he was worth thirty
	          million or something, now it turns
	          out they can't find half of it.
	               (singsong)
	          Somebody took something didn't
	          belong to them!
	
	                     EVAN
	          I hardly see how family gossip is
	          germane to showing the property.
	
	                     LYDIA
	               (low, to Meg)
	          Stop calling it the property, you
	          sound ridiculous.
	
	                     EVAN
	               (through a closet)
	          Master closet.
	
	From the hallway, there is a GROANING METALLIC sound, the
	elevator, and the happy laughter of the little girl as she
	puts it through its paces.  Evan winces, speaks as if his
	mouth hurts when he moves it.
	
	                     EVAN
	          Could the child please stop that?
	
	                     LYDIA
	          KID!  NO ELEVATOR!
	
	She looks at Meg and winks.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
	
	                     EVAN
	          And we emerge in the master bedroom.
	
	He checks his watch.
	
	Meg looks around, studying the dimensions of the room.  She
	looks at the far wall, the one that borders the house next
	door.  She looks at the wall that corners it, opposite the
	window wall.  She takes two steps back from it.
	
	                     MEG
	          Something's weird.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          What?
	
	                     MEG
	          I don't know, doesn't that corner
	          seem funny to you?
	
	She points to the far end of the wall, near the entrance to
	the closet.  There is a mirrored door that leads to the
	closet, and a mirror on the wall alongside it.  If you look
	closely, you'll see that the mirrors are raked slightly
	toward one another, which causes an optical illusion in which
	the corner of the room appears much closer to the door than
	it is.
	
	                     EVAN
	          I was waiting to see if you'd
	          notice!  On caravan, no one from our
	          office had the slightest idea.
	
	He pushes on the top of the mirror on the wall.  It makes a
	faint CLICK, then glides open a few inches off the wall.  He
	pulls it toward him, opens it all the way, a hundred eighty
	degrees, and it fastens magnetically to the back of the
	closed door.  There is smooth wall behind it, but if you look
	closely, there is a faint vertical crack in the wall.
	
	Meg looks at him -- what in the world?  Even pushes again,
	twice this time, first at the top, then at the bottom, and
	the smooth wall CLICKS ajar.  He pulls it wide open.  Meg and
	Lydia step forward, fascinated.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - DAY
	
	From the opposite end of a lone, narrow, windowless space, we
	see the three of them standing in the open doorway,
	silhouetted by the sunlight streaming through the bedroom
	windows behind them.
	
	                     EVAN
	          It's called a panic room.
	
	He hits a switch and a row of bulbs flick on overhead.
	
	                     MEG
	          A what?
	
	                     EVAN
	          A safe room.  An inner sanctum.  A
	          castle keep, in medieval times.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          Oh, I've seen these...
	
	                     EVAN
	          It's quite in vogue in high end
	          construction right now.  One really
	          can't be too careful about home
	          invasion.
	
	The other two walk inside, but Meg lingers near the door,
	looking around, studying the neatly arrayed survival supplies
	-- water, food packs, batteries, flashlights, tools, rope,
	clothes, blankets -- you get the idea.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          Hey, this is perfect for you...
	               (Meg scoffs)
	          Absolutely!  You're a woman, you're
	          living alone now.  Your alarm goes
	          off, or you head glass break, or for
	          whatever reason you think someone's
	          broken into your home in the middle
	          of the night.  What are you going to
	          do?  Call the police and wait until
	          they get here on Tuesday?  Traipse
	          downstairs in your sexy little
	          underthings and check it out?  I
	          think not!
	
	                     EVAN
	          Reinforced steel core walls.  Buried
	          phone line, completely separate, not
	          connected to the house's main line
	          and never exposed throughout the
	          house's infrastructure or outside
	          the house -- you can call the
	          police; nobody can cut you off.
	          Your own ventilation system,
	          complete with oxygen scrubber, so
	          you've got plenty of fresh air for
	          as long as you like.  And a bank of
	          video monitors --
	
	He hits a switch next to a dozen tiny video monitors,
	revealing a dozen different views of the house.
	
	                     EVAN
	          -- covering almost every corner of
	          the house.
	
	Meg nods, starting to sweat.
	
	                     MEG
	          Makes me nervous.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          Why?
	
	                     MEG
	          Ever read any Poe?
	
	                     LYDIA
	          I don't think so, but I love her
	          album.
	
	                     MEG
	          No, Edgar Allen.
	
	                     LYDIA
	               (thinks)
	          The furniture guy?
	
	                     MEG
	               (giving up)
	          What's to keep them from prying open
	          the door?
	
	Evan reaches past Meg and pushes a red button on the wall
	behind her.  With a sudden WHANG of steel, a heavy metal door
	leaps out of a slot in the wall and SLAMS shut, like a
	submarine hatch.  A series of metal latches CLICK into place
	inside it, from top to bottom, securing it into place.
	
	                     EVAN
	          Steel, four inches thick.
	
	Meg takes a step back.  They're now enclosed in the room.
	
	                     EVAN
	          Everything's spring-loaded, even if
	          the power's out it's fully
	          functional.
	
	                     MEG
	          Open it.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with
	          this room, did he?
	
	                     MEG
	          Open the door.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          And with kids like he's got, no
	          wonder he wanted a place to hide.
	
	                     EVAN
	          That's highly inappropriate.
	
	                     MEG
	          I said open the door.
	
	Evan hits a green button and the door GROANS slowly open,
	recoiling its massive spring, and revealing Sarah, the little
	girl, standing in the entryway, grinning widely.
	
	                     SARAH
	          My room.  Definitely my room.
	
	She bolts in, just as her mother bolts out.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
	
	Meg stands just outside the door to the panic room, regaining
	her composure.  Not crazy about tight spaces.  Which we
	already knew.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          That door is a safely hazard.
	
	                     EVAN
	          Not at all.
	
	He points.  There's a tiny red beam that shines across the
	doorway, one at shoulder height --
	
	                     EVAN
	          Infrared.  Like the beam in an
	          elevator doorway.  Won't let the
	          door close if something's blocking
	          it.
	
	-- and one at shin height.  Even bend down, blocks the one at
	shin height with his hand.
	
	                     EVAN
	          Watch.
	
	He reaches up, to push the close button, but with one hand
	anchored at the floor, he can't quite reach it.
	
	                     EVAN
	               (to Lydia)
	          Push that button for me, will you?
	
	                     MEG
	          Don't!
	
	Lydia pushes the close button, nothing happens.  Evan pulls
	his hand put of the beam, takes a step back.  Lydia pushes
	the button again.
	
	WHANG!  The metal door rockets shut, the metallic slang
	reverberating in the room.  Almost immediately, the fake
	piece of wall HUMS shut, of its own accord, followed a moment
	later by the mirror, which detaches itself from the back of
	the closet door and HUMS silently back into place, closing
	over the hidden door, making the corner of the room look like
	a corner again.
	
	As the mirrored door closes, it shows Meg her own reflection.
	She looks at herself, still rattled.  She wipes a trickle of
	sweat from the side of her face.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  TOWNHOUSE - FOYER - DAY
	
	The same house, two weeks later.  The entry floor is piled
	high with moving boxes.  Sarah and Meg lie sprawled out in
	the middle of the black and white tile, arms and legs splayed
	wide, exhausted.
	
	They stare up at the ceiling, beat.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Too many stairs.
	
	                     MEG
	          Got us in here, didn't I?
	
	                     SARAH
	          Shoulda got an apartment.
	
	                     MEG
	          Well, I know that now.
	
	                     SARAH
	          478-0150.
	
	Meg raises her hand to her face, she's got her cell phone in
	her palm.
	
	                     MEG
	          Battery's dead.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - DAY
	
	Meg picks up the wall phone in the kitchen, gets a dial tone.
	
	                     MEG
	          The phone works.
	               (to Sarah)
	          Hey, I hooked up the phone.
	
	                     SARAH
	               (sarcastic)
	          The crowd goes wild.
	
	                     MEG

	          478...
	
	                     SARAH
	          0150.
	
	Meg finishes dialing.  It rings, someone answers.
	
	                     VOICE
	          Perry's Pizza, please hold.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	Night has fallen.  Meg and Sarah sit at a small table in the
	middle of the kitchen, surrounded by packing boxes.  They eat
	pizza.  They chew, silently.  Sarah drinks a diet Dr.
	Pepper.  Meg finishes a glass of wine.
	
	Meg's eyes are moist.  Sarah notices.  She notices her
	noticing, shrugs.  I'm human, what do you want me to do, hide
	it?
	
	Sarah looks away, goes back to chewing.  After a moment:
	
	                     SARAH
	          Fuck him.
	
	                     MEG
	          Don't.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Fuck her too.
	
	Meg looks at her, not sure how to confront the open defiance.
	
	                     MEG
	          I agree.  But don't.
	
	Sarah stares at her for a moment, then goes back to eating.
	
	Meg picks up the bottle of wine.
	
	Sarah's eyes flick over and watch as wine GLUGS into her
	mother's glass.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Sarah's bedroom is full of unpacked boxes, but her twin bed
	has been set up and Sarah is in it, hair wet, pajamas on.
	She reads from a book ("Tom Swift and His Repelatron Skyway")
	while Meg, drowsy, lies next to her, listening.
	
	                     SARAH
	          "Tom's throat felt so dry and tight
	          that it was a moment before he could
	          make any sound come out.  "Dad!" He
	          croaked.  "I'm - inside - the -
	          machine!" "Great Scott!"  The elder
	          scientist gasped.  He dashed across
	          the laboratory and switched off the
	          repelatron's motor.  "What happened,
	          son?" "The Durafoam hardened, Dad.
	          Get a solvent, quick -- you know the
	          formula!"
	
	INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the master bathroom, Meg soaks in a bath.  She is
	exhausted.  She reaches for her wine glass, finishes the last
	of it.
	
	She stretches for the bottle, which is on the floor next to
	her.  She refills the glass.  Again.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg, dressed in an old Knicks T-shirt and boxer shorts,
	stands next to the alarm panel in the master bedroom, reading
	from an instruction manual.  She's frustrated.  She mutters,
	slurring, a bit drunk.
	
	                     MEG
	          Bypass non-ready zones... shunt,
	          enter, zone number...
	
	She tries it, pushing a few buttons, but the alarm panel
	BEEPS at her disapprovingly.  She's doing something wrong.
	
	She sighs, sits on the floor, gets serious about figuring out
	the instructions.
	
	                     MEG
	          Bypass non-ready zones... ah, shunt,
	          enter, shunt again, zone number...
	          wait...
	
	HER FINGERS
	
	dance over the alarm panel, some time later.  She seems to
	have figured it out, and a small light on the panel lights
	up.
	
	SYSTEM ARMED
	
	The very moment the red light goes on, we cut sharply to --
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	-- the darkened panic room, where the dozen small video
	screens all suddenly wink to life, showing a dozen views of
	the house.  Whatever she pushed turned these on too, probably
	not what she meant to do, but at least she got the alarm on
	for the night.
	
	The door that leads from the panic room to the master bedroom
	hangs open.  In the middle of the floor in here, somebody has
	made a small tent of blankets and couch cushions.  Sarah must
	have been playing here before bed.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg puts sheets on her bed in the master bedroom.
	
	She fills a glass of water, puts it on a box she's using for
	a night table.
	
	She plugs in a battery charger for her cell phone, places the
	phone in the cradle.  It BEEPS.  "Charging."
	
	She sets the digital clock, puts it next to the glass of
	water.  It's 12:26.
	
	She gets in bed, her side, the left side.
	
	She lies in the dark, half an acre of empty bed across from
	her.
	
	We drift off her, see the clock again.  The time changes, the
	number one dissolves away, changing the time to --
	
	                                             DISSOLVE TO:
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	-- 2:26.  Meg is in a hard, boozy sleep.  We drift out the
	door of the master bedroom, into the third floor hallway, and
	down the open stairwell.  We glide through the entry floor,
	still gently falling through the stairwell's airway, dropping
	even further, all the way down to the kitchen floor, the
	ground floor.
	
	We drift across the darkened kitchen, serpentine through the
	canyon of moving boxes, approach the window that looks out on
	the street.
	
	We move right up against the window, peer through the glass
	just as --
	
	-- a van pulls up across the street and stops.  Can't see
	through its windows.  No movement for a moment, then the
	driver's door opens and a MAN climbs out.  He wears dark
	clothes.
	
	The Man closes the door, looks both ways, and starts across
	the street towards us.  He's carrying a bag of some kind.
	
	He goes to the door, and we drift down toward the doorknob.
	We hear a key slide into the door, rattle.
	
	But the lock doesn't turn.  The key slides out, back in
	again, jiggles.  Still won't open the door.
	
	The Man steps away from the door, goes to the kitchen window,
	which is heavily barred, and peers inside, right at us.
	Can't see anything, it's darker in here than it is out there.
	
	He turns, looks both ways on the street again, then steps up,
	onto the window ledge.  Now we can only see his legs, can't
	tell what he's doing.  He's reaching up, stretching for
	something.  It drops into view with a metallic SCRAPE.
	
	The fire escape.
	
	The Man climbs, his feet disappearing from our field of
	vision.
	
	We turn around, facing the other way in the kitchen.  We
	start back the way we came, through the canyon of boxes in
	the kitchen, toward the stairwell.
	
	INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT
	
	Back in the stairwell, the exact reverse of the shot we saw
	earlier.  We're drifting up, off the kitchen floor, through
	the entry floor, and as we rise we notice something all the
	way up on the roof that we couldn't see before, when we were
	looking down.
	
	A skylight.  We continue to rise, drawn toward it.  We move
	up, through the master bedroom floor, creeping up alongside
	the stair banister, now reaching the top floor of the house,
	and just as we near the skylight --
	
	-- a figure appears, visible through it.  The Man in dark
	clothes, on the roof now.  He stops, peers down through the
	skylight, looking at us without seeing us again.
	
	He steps across the skylight.  This is not the way he intends
	to enter.  We drift again, following his soft footsteps on
	the roof, which we can hear faintly through the ceiling.
	
	Here in the hall, just outside Sarah's bedroom, a closet door
	is ajar.  We squeeze through the gap and into the closet.
	
	IN THE CLOSET,
	
	it's completely dark.  Can't see a thing.  But then a sliver
	of light appears, coming from above.  We look up.
	
	There is a ladder that's bolted to the wall in this closet,
	it leads up to a square panel in the ceiling.
	
	Roof access.  And that roof access panel is moving, ever so
	slightly, moonlight spilling in as it twists in its setting.
	A shiny silver something slides through the crack along the
	edges of the portal.
	
	It slithers along the edge of the hatchway, searching for
	something.  It finds a small round nub in the crack.  The
	silver something stops.  It HUMS with electricity for a
	moment, then there is a bright spark and a soft CRACK.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the master bedroom, a message appears on the alarm panel:
	
	ZONE 19 DISABLED
	
	INT.  CLOSET - NIGHT
	
	In the closet, the silver something withdraws and the roof
	access panel is removed.  A million stars are visible in the
	night sky above.  But we're inside.
	
	And in a moment, so is this intruder.  The Man peers down,
	through the open hatchway, then slips through the opening and
	climbs silently down the ladder.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In bed, Meg stirs.  An alcohol sleep is a restless one, and
	she's suffering.
	
	She sits up groggily, chugs a glass of water.  Lies down
	again.
	
	INT.  FOURTH FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	One floor up, the Man steps into the hallway and starts for
	the stairs, moving quickly and confidently.  Knows where he's
	going, knows what he wants.  He starts down the stairs,
	happens to glance to the side as he does so.
	
	He freezes.  He's looking in the open doorway of the top
	floor bathroom, staring hard at something that clearly
	disturbs him.
	
	A nightlight.  Plugged into an outlet in the baseboard in the
	bathroom.  (For the record, it's the Power Puff Girls.)  The
	Man climbs the stairs again, concerned, goes to the door of
	the bathroom.  He looks from the nightlight to the
	countertop.
	
	There's a moving box on the countertop.  His eyes widen.
	This is news to him, bad news.
	
	He takes a step back and a breath.  He turns, looks to the
	end of the hall.  His eyes now adjusted to the darkness, he
	notices something he didn't see before, something coming from
	under the door to the fourth floor bedroom.
	
	Light.  From inside.  From another nightlight.
	
	INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the top floor bedroom, a nightlight burns in another
	outlet.  Nearby, Sarah is asleep in bed, the covers kicked
	off.
	
	The door to Sarah's bedroom glides open, terribly slowly.
	The Man stands in the doorway, staring, aghast, at the
	mountain of moving boxes piled in the room.  His gaze falls
	on Sarah in the bed.
	
	The Man just stares, beside himself.  His lips mouth a word,
	soundlessly.  Doesn't take a lip reader to guess it.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the master bedroom, Meg flops over in bed, facing away
	from the doorway, really having a rough go of it.  She slept
	too hard before, now she's awake, her head is killing her,
	she's really paying the price of four glasses of wine.
	
	She lies still, on her side, facing us.
	
	Behind her, the bedroom door moves, silently.
	
	Opening.
	
	The Man stands there, one finger still on the door he's just
	pushed open.  He stares at the sleeping form of Meg on the
	bed, whose back is to him.  He has no idea she's awake.
	
	Meg lies in bed, eyes wide open, no idea a Man is standing in
	the doorway to her bedroom.
	
	Noiselessly, the Man moves away, down the hall.  The moment
	his head disappears down the stairwell --
	
	-- Meg flops over again, facing the doorway.  She closes her
	eyes, gives sleep another try.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	The Man walks across the kitchen, shaking his head in
	exasperation at the packing boxes all around him.  He goes to
	the front window, peers outside.  He reaches for a light
	switch on his right.
	
	Through the window, we can see the stoop light go on.  Then
	off, then on and off again.
	
	Still through the window, we see the side panel door of the
	van slide open.
	
	TWO MORE MEN climb out.  They are also dressed in dark
	clothes.  They also carry satchels.
	
	They walks calmly across the street, grow large in the window
	as they approach us.  The first intruder (who has a name,
	it's BURNHAM) steps over to the kitchen door, runs his
	silvery strip through the gap.  Another HUM and spark.
	
	AN ALARM PANEL
	
	flashes again.
	
	ZONE 1 DISABLED
	
	IN THE KITCHEN,
	
	Burnham opens the kitchen door, letting the two other guys
	slip inside.  RAOUL is a hulking figure whose back seems to
	rise up over the top of his slouching head; when he walks it
	looks like gravity does all the work, just pulling him
	forward.  JUNIOR is much smaller, very high-strung, dresses
	like a homey, very street, but can't hide the fact that the
	street is Park Avenue.
	
	They all freeze, staring at the moving boxes.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Fuck.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I know.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          What?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          A woman and a little girl, both
	          asleep upstairs.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Fuck!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Keep your voice down.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          They're not supposed to be here!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          This was your department, Junior.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          They're not supposed to be here!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          That's why the key didn't work, they
	          changed the locks.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Fourteen day escrow, man, that's
	          almost three weeks!  They shouldn't
	          be here for another week!  They
	          don't own this house yet!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	               (pause)
	          Exactly how is fourteen days almost
	          three weeks?
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Fourteen business days.  Escrow is
	          always business days.
	
	Burnham sighs.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          I mean, right?  Isn't it?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          You're an idiot.
	
	Raoul steps forward, shoves Burnham with both hands in the
	chest.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Watch your mouth.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          It's okay, Raoul.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	               (to Junior)
	          Who is this guy?
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Raoul is cool.  That's all you need
	          to know.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          This is insane.  I'm outta here.
	
	He starts for the door.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Wait a minute, wait a minute.  We
	          can still handle this.
	               (to Raoul)
	          Can we still handle this?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          It's just the woman and the kid?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Unless Daddy comes back later.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Daddy's not coming back, she's in
	          the middle of a divorce, it's just
	          the two of them.  We're okay, here.
	               (to Raoul)
	          We can do this, right?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You're fuckin' A we can do this.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Not with me.  Not with people.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Forty-five minutes.  That's all you
	          said you need.  That's like nothing.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          She'll call the cops, they'll be
	          here before I get unpacked.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          So we keep an eye on her.  Raoul can
	          totally administrate that part.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          No problem.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I don't want Raoul to administrate
	          that part.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          They won't get hurt.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          What about us?  What if she has a
	          gun?
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Raoul, what in God's name do we do
	          if she has a gun?
	
	Raoul pulls up his sweatshirt, revealing a .38 tucked into
	his belt.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Asshole.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and
	          you insult him?  Hey, who's the
	          idiot?  Huh?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Where did you get this clown?
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          I met him at the tables, same as
	          you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we
	          have a little muscle right about
	          now.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          What tables?  I've never seen him
	          before.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Different tables.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	               (to Raoul)
	          The fuck did you bring a gun for?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You're welcome.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Peace out.
	
	He moves for the door.  Junior, trying desperately to hold
	this together, gets there first, blocks the door with his
	back.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          We can't do it without you, Burnham.
	
	Junior starts at Burnham.  Raoul stares at Burnham.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          It's still a good plan.  It's
	          just... got a twist.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Yeah.  Kidnapping.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't
	          kidnap somebody in their own house.
	          It's just breaking and entering,
	          unless we take 'em someplace.  Or
	          something like that, I'm pretty
	          sure.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Pure idiot.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          I am.  I'm an idiot's son.  An
	          idiot's grandson.  I'm third-
	          generation idiot.  But for once in
	          my life I had a good idea, and I'm
	          not giving up so easy.  You are?
	          Are you actually telling me that for
	          the first time in your life you're
	          gonna throw your cards on the table
	          and go home early?  I can't believe
	          my eyes.
	               (Burnham hesitates)
	          Fourteen million dollars upstairs,
	          Burnham.  You'll be out of the hole.
	          Baby, you'll be so far out of the
	          hole you could draw bricks every
	          night for the next twenty years and
	          still shit green.
	               (Burnham sways)
	          Come on, Buddy.  One more hand.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg sits up in bed.  She's bleary, her head feels like
	someone rested a manhole cover on it.  She gets up, in the
	dark, and staggers off toward the bathroom door, feeling her
	way with her arms, her eyes not adjusted to the dark.
	
	She steps through the door.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	She walks into the bathroom and feels around for a light
	switch, but can't find it.  She blinks, squints, tries to get
	her bearings.  The only light is a harsh white glow that
	comes from along one wall, from a bank of tiny video
	monitors.
	
	She finds the light switch, flicks it on, it nearly blinds
	her.  She's not in the bathroom.  She's wandered into the
	panic room by mistake.
	
	She turns around, walks out, leaving the lights on behind
	her.
	
	We linger for a look at the video screens.  If only she'd
	done the same, she'd see what we see.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	we see the three men, still in the kitchen, huddled in a
	group, silently debating what to do.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Using the light that spills from the open door to the panic
	room, Meg comes back into the master bedroom and finds the
	proper door to the bathroom.
	
	INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg SNAPS the cap off a jug of Advil and dumps three into her
	palm.  She pops them in her mouth, searches for a glass for
	water, finds none, bends to the spout for a gulp to wash them
	down.
	
	She turns to the toilet.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	On the monitor, we see the three men leave the kitchen and
	start up the stairs.
	
	INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg stands, flushes the toilet.
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	One floor down, Burnham, Raoul, and Junior freeze, just
	coming up the stairs from the kitchen.  They look up, hearing
	the water rushing through the pipes in the ceiling directly
	above them.
	
	They stare at the ceiling, following with their eyes as a
	pair of feet pad across the CREAKY floor.  Finally, they hear
	a SQUEAK of bedsprings as Meg climbs back into bed.
	
	They hold a moment longer, a silence grows.  Raoul reaches
	into his jacket pocket and pulls out a ski mask.  He pulls it
	over his head.  They look at him.
	
	                     RAOUL
	               (whispers)
	          No face.
	
	Burnham rolls his eyes.  Doesn't know this guy much, but
	hates him so far.  They start across the foyer toward the
	stairs.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg rolls over, to go back to sleep.  She sees she's left the
	lights on in the panic room.  She TSKS, gets out of bed, and
	walks across the floor toward it.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg steps into the panic room, raises her hand to the light
	switch --
	
	-- and stops, her hand frozen in mid-air.  She cocks her
	head, looking at something she can't understand.
	
	She blinks.  Takes a step, further into the room.  She stares
	at the video monitors -- at the three men in dark clothes,
	stealing silently across the foyer.
	
	This can't be.  These are just pictures, they have no
	relation to reality.  She drops to her knees, her face inches
	from the screens, and reaches out to touch them, as if trying
	to make sure they're really there.
	
	INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT
	
	They reach the base of the stairs, Junior in the lead.  As he
	reaches a bend at the base of the stairs, he places one foot
	short on an angled step and it slips off.  He trips, falls
	forward.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Watching the video monitors, Meg stares in horror as the
	image of Junior slipping is verified by the SLAP of his hands
	on the stairs as he catches himself, audible through the open
	door to the panic room.
	
	She GASPS.  It is real.
	
	INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT
	
	In the living room, Burnham's eyes are wide as saucers,
	staring at Junior as he turns and pulls himself to his feet.
	
	Junior points at Raoul, speaks in an urgent whisper.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Top floor, get the little girl and
	          keep her there.  I'll bring the
	          woman up.  Gimme.
	
	He holds out his hand for the gun and Raoul gives it to him.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	               (points to Burnham)
	          Stay here.  Nobody gets past you.
	
	He heads for the stairs.  Raoul follows close behind him.
	Burnham stays, reluctant -- what the fuck has he gotten
	himself into?
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg moves.  Leaps to her feet and dashes out of the room.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg races across her bedroom, flies out the door, and bolts
	up the carpeted stairs, headed for the top floor.
	
	INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg races into Sarah's room, drops onto the bed, and grabs
	Sarah by the shoulders, trying to rouse her.
	
	                     MEG
	          Wake up... wake up...
	
	But she's in a profound child's sleep and won't wake up.
	
	INT.  THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	One floor down, Junior and Raoul reach the third floor
	landing.  Still moving stealthily, Junior heads down the hall
	for the master bedroom, where he thinks Meg is sleeping.
	Raoul heads for the stairs that lead to the top floor.
	
	INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg is desperate, still can't wake Sarah.
	
	                     MEG
	          Wake up...come on, come on...
	
	She sees a plastic cup on her night table/box, half filled
	with water.  She snatches it and tosses the water in her
	face.
	
	Now she's awake.  And pissed off.  She SPUTTERS, SHOUTS.
	
	                     SARAH
	          WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR?!
	
	INT.  THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	Raoul, at the base of the stairs that lead to the top floor,
	hears the kid shouting.  He starts up the stairs, quickly.
	
	INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	On the top floor, Meg is already dragging Sarah out of the
	room and into the hallway.
	
	INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	Meg and Sarah come out of Sarah's bedroom just as Raoul
	reaches the top of the stairs at the other end.  They're cut
	off.
	
	Meg freezes, staring at the hulking ski-masked figure at the
	end of the hallway.  She thinks, no idea what to do for a
	second.  She looks frantically to her right -- the bathroom,
	dead end.
	
	She looks to her left.
	
	The elevator.
	
	She yanks open the elevator door, throws aside the gate, and
	races inside with Sarah.
	
	Raoul takes off down the hall, lunging for the elevator.
	
	INT.  ELEVATOR - NIGHT
	
	Meg SLAMS the gate shut and PUNCHES the button for the first
	floor.  The elevator GROANS to life and starts down --
	slowly.
	
	Sarah looks up at her, terrified.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What's going on?!
	
	                     MEG
	          People.  In the house.
	
	As the elevator descends, they see Raoul, through the window
	in the door, as he drops to his knees, to get a good look at
	them.
	
	INT.  TOP FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	Raoul turns from the elevator, SHOUTS to the open stairwell.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          IN THE ELEVATOR!  BOTH OF 'EM HEADED
	          TOWARD YOU!
	
	INT.  THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	Junior turns from the open doorway of the master bedroom and
	races back down the hall, toward the elevator.  He reaches
	the door, peers through the window.
	
	He sees the bare feet of Meg and Sarah, dropping toward him.
	He grabs the door handle, pulls as hard as he can, but it
	stays locked, with the elevator moving beyond.
	
	He bangs on the button, hoping the elevator will stop.  As
	Meg and Sarah drop fully into view, he stands there, eye to
	moving eye with her for a moment.  But the elevator doesn't
	stop, it keeps going down.
	
	INT.  ELEVATOR - NIGHT
	
	Meg stands frozen, terrified, staring at Junior as they move
	past him.
	
	Junior has another go at the door, pulling as hard as he can,
	actually bending the door, but the elevator is still moving,
	the catch holds fast and the door won't open.
	
	As they pass, his face suddenly disappears, he takes off.
	
	INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT
	
	Junior flies down the stairs, to cut them off at the first
	floor.
	
	INT.  ELEVATOR - NIGHT
	
	                     MEG
	          He's going down.
	
	                     SARAH
	          That room!
	
	                     MEG
	          What?!
	
	                     SARAH
	          PANIC ROOM!
	
	Meg thinks, then punches the button for three, to go back up.
	
	But the elevator continues down.  She jabs at it, futilely.
	
	                     SARAH
	          No.  you gotta...
	
	She reaches past her, pushes the STOP button.  The elevator
	jerks to a halt.  Then Sarah pushes three.  Now the elevator
	starts to rise.
	
	Meg looks at her, impressed.  Love that kid.
	
	INT.  ENTRY FLOOR - NIGHT
	
	In the foyer, Junior freezes, hearing the elevator stop and
	start again.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          SHE'S COMING BACK UP TOWARD YOU!!
	
	He takes off up the stairs again.  Burnham can't take it
	anymore, he takes off after Junior, following him upstairs.
	
	INT.  FOURTH FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	Raoul, still on the top floor, heads for the stairs, fast.
	
	INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT
	
	Junior races back up the stairs.  They have her caught in the
	middle.
	
	INT.  THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	The door to the elevator BANGS open on three, the gate
	RATTLES aside, and Meg and Sarah leap out.  They take off
	down the hall, toward the doorway to the master bedroom.
	
	Raoul flies down the stairs, not twenty feet behind them.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg and Sarah run through the master bedroom.  As she passes
	the night table, Sarah swings an open hand to grab her cell
	phone from its cradle.  But in her haste she starts to pull
	it out at an angle and the prongs at the bottom stick in the
	charger.  The phone slips from her fingers, bounces off the
	corner of the table, caroms off her foot, and skitters under
	the bed.
	
	Sarah turns, looks to the head of the stairs just as Junior
	turns the corner and Raoul thunders down the steps from four.
	
	She abandons the phone, grabs Sarah, and they lunge through
	the open doorway to the panic room.
	
	Junior and Raoul burst through the doorway to the bedroom,
	just a few steps away.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg and Sarah trip over each other coming through the
	doorway, they tumble to the floor of the panic room, the door
	wide open behind them.  Meg spins around, hurls herself at
	the red button on the wall --
	
	-- Junior leaps, sailing through the air toward them --
	
	-- Meg SLAMS her open palm on the red button, the massive
	coiled spring that holds the metal door open is released, the
	steel barrier leaps forward out of the wall --
	
	-- and WHANGS shut in a split-second.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Junior SLAMS into the closing metal door, banging his
	shoulder into it, and slithers to the ground, too late.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg rolls over and pulls Sarah into her arms, both of them
	breathing hard, asking each other if they're okay, scared out
	of their minds.
	
	But safe.
	
	She spots the telephone, the one with the special buried
	phone line.  She lunges for it, snatches it from its cradle,
	listens for a dial tone.
	
	Nothing there either.
	
	                     MEG
	          Damn it!
	
	                     SARAH
	          It doesn't work?!
	
	                     MEG
	          Different phone line, I never hooked
	          it up!
	
	She hurls it down, looks back at Sarah.  She seems a bit
	pale, scared.  She goes to her, holds her, reassures her.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Junior is slumped at the base of the door, livid, in pain,
	pounding on it with his fists, screaming "NO!" over and over
	again, crazy with rage.
	
	Raoul stands in the middle of the room, chest heaving, hands
	on his knees.
	
	Burnham finally walks into the room and stops in the doorway,
	looks from Raoul to Junior to the door to the panic room,
	figures out the situation.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Tell me... tell me they're not in
	          there...
	
	We rise up, above them, above the room, looking down on them,
	the rats-in-a-maze shot.
	
	We rise up further still, above where the ceiling ought to
	be, to look down on this room and the one beside it, the room
	behind the four inches of reinforced steel, the panic room in
	which Meg and Sarah kneel in the middle of the floor, holding
	each other tight.
	
	Standoff.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Very close on the metal door, from inside the panic room.  An
	ear moves slowly into frame, presses against the cold steel.
	Listens.
	
	Meg pulls away from the door, shaking her head.
	
	                     MEG
	          Can't hear a thing.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What do they want?
	
	                     MEG
	          I don't know.  Rob us.  I don't
	          know.
	
	She sits back against a wall, looks around, at the tiny room.
	She's trying not to show how freaked out she is.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What do we do?
	
	                     MEG
	          Wait.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What if they get in here?
	
	                     MEG
	          They can't.  They can't get in here.
	          No.  They can't.
	
	                     SARAH
	          I heard you.
	
	                     MEG
	          Feel okay?
	
	                     SARAH
	          Yeah.
	
	                     MEG
	          Shaky?
	
	                     SARAH
	          Nope.
	
	                     MEG
	          Chills?
	
	                     SARAH
	          Huh uh.
	
	She checks her wristwatch, for some reason.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Don't worry about me.
	
	The implications being, worry about yourself.
	
	Sarah crawls over to the bank of video monitors, studies
	them.  Meg crawls over to join her.  They scan the screens.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	there are a dozen different views of the house.  Front stoop.
	Kitchen.  Dining room.  Entry floor.  Living room.  Master
	bedroom.  Den.  Top floor bedrooms, both of them.  Top two
	floor hallways.  Even one with a shot of the inside of the
	elevator.
	
	The three intruders are gathered in the living room, standing
	in a tight circle, having a hell of an argument.  Lots of
	gesturing, fingers jabbing in chests, but we can't hear a
	word.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg furrows her brow, noticing something interesting to the
	right of the video monitors.  She slides over, studies a
	panel there with sixteen different buttons and a small
	grilled area.
	
	                     MEG
	          Hey...
	
	Sarah joins her, looks at the buttons.  Each one is labeled
	with a different room name -- den, kitchen, master bedroom,
	etc.  Up in the corner there is a button that says "ALL
	PAGE," down in the opposite corner there's a button marked
	"TALK."
	
	Meg looks at Sarah.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Go ahead.
	
	Meg is reluctant, frightened.  Sarah is encouraging, for the
	first time.
	
	                     SARAH
	          You can do it.
	
	Meg leans forward, clears her throat.
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham, Raoul, and Junior are standing in the half-darkened
	living room, in the middle of their argument, when a VOICE
	booms around them.
	
	                     MEG (O.S.)
	          Excuse me.
	
	They practically jump out of their shoes, looking around for
	the source of the voice.
	
	                     MEG (O.S.)
	          The police are on their way.
	
	Only Burnham has remained relatively calm.  After he gets
	over the initial shock, he walks toward the tiny camera
	that's hidden in an upper corner of the living room wall and
	stares up at it.  Raoul, who has taken off his ski mask, is
	careful to move out of the camera's range, and turn his back
	to it.
	
	                     MEG
	          I suggest you leave.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	Burnham looks up at the camera and shakes his head, wagging a
	finger from side to side.  He raises a hand, makes a gesture
	like a telephone, then wags his finger again.  The message is
	clear -- you don't have a phone.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg is puzzled.
	
	                     MEG
	          How'd he know that?
	
	She presses the talk button again.
	
	                     MEG
	               (into speaker)
	          Take what you want and get out.
	
	That sounded fairly tough.  She looks at the monitor again.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	the three of them have an urgent, whispered conference, then
	they all start patting their pockets for some reason, turning
	in circles, looking for something.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg and Sarah watch them, confused.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	Burnham holds up a finger to the camera -- wait a second --
	while Raoul and Junior rush off screen, looking for
	something.  Junior returns a moment later holding something
	and the three of them hunch over a box, working on something.
	
	After a moment, they break apart and Junior steps up to the
	camera holding a pad of paper.  He shows it to the camera.
	On the top page, in big block letters, they've written.
	
	WHAT WE WANT
	
	After a suitable pause for reading, he turns to the second
	page, where four more words are written.
	
	IS IN THAT ROOM.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah GASPS, Meg sits back.
	
	                     MEG
	          "What we want is in that room."
	
	                     SARAH
	          They're coming in here, aren't they?
	
	                     MEG
	          No, I told you, they can't.  It's
	          not a possibility.
	
	Angry, she sits forward and jabs the talk button.
	
	                     MEG
	               (into speaker)
	          What do you know about this room?
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	there is more frenzied writing, more arguing, and a first
	draft of a response torn up.  Finally, Junior steps forward
	with another sign:
	
	MORE THAN YOU.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg's confidence is ebbing, but she doesn't want to show it.
	She hits the talk button again.
	
	                     MEG
	               (into speaker)
	          We're not coming out.  We're not
	          letting you in.  Get out of my
	          house.
	               (clicks off)
	
	                     SARAH
	          Say fuck.
	
	                     MEG
	               (into speaker)
	          Fuck.
	
	                     SARAH
	          "Get the fuck out of my house."
	
	                     MEG
	               (into speaker)
	          Get the fuck out of my house!
	
	She clicks off again, looks to Sarah for approval, and gets
	it, sort of, in Sarah's half-smile.  But Sarah's eyes go back
	to the screen.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Answer.
	
	Meg follows Sarah's eyes back to the screen, where another
	message is being held up for them.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	the notepad says:
	
	WE WILL LET YOU GO.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg and Sarah speak at the same time.
	
	                     MEG
	          Oh, please.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Give me a break.
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the living room, her voice booms from the speaker.
	
	                     MEG (O.S.)
	          Conversation's over.
	
	With an audible CLICK, she signs off.  Burnham, Raoul, and
	Junior stand arrayed beneath the camera, staring up at it,
	dumbfounded.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Got her right where you want her,
	          Junior.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Shut up.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          When you said you'd let 'em go I
	          thought she'd come running right out
	          for sure.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Shut up and let me think.
	
	He opens a pack of cigarettes, takes out a joint and lights
	it.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I'm afraid to let you think, Junior.
	          Things get worse when you think.
	               (sniffs)
	          Oh, that's gonna help.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	               (holding in a hit)
	          Okay, fuckball, you think.  What are
	          we gonna do?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          What if she called the cops?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          She didn't.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          She said she did.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          She lied.  Cops woulda been here by
	          now if she called 'em.  Besides,
	          Junior cut the phones.
	
	Burnham goes to the window and stares outside.  He laughs,
	covers his face.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          What the fuck is funny about this?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          God.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          There is not one thing funny here.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Who else but God could think this
	          shit up?  I spend ten years building
	          those fucking rooms to keep people
	          out, now I gotta figure out how to
	          get in.  God, man, He just loves the
	          irony.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic
	          and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are
	          you gonna get us into that room?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in
	          the room.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          So what the fuck are we supposed to
	          do?!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Make her come out.  And when she
	          does, that's when we gotta be
	          careful.  She can't get out of this
	          house.  She can't even think she can
	          get out of this house.  We just keep
	          them here and keep them quiet for
	          forty-five minutes.  And I don't
	          want
	               (Raoul)
	          Joe Pesci here standing over them
	          with his fat sweaty finger on the
	          trigger.  That's a sure way for us
	          to end up with two dead bodies and
	          little puffs of smoke burning out of
	          our heads up in Greenhaven.  So
	          we're gonna seal the place up.  They
	          wanna hole up in here?  Fine, we'll
	          help 'em.  Make it impossible for
	          them to leave.  Once they come out
	          of that room.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          And why exactly would they want to
	          come out?
	
	At the window, Burnham notices something sitting just outside
	the French doors, on the balcony.  It's a large outdoor
	barbecue grill.  He thinks, takes a step closer.
	
	He sees a white five gallon tank of some kind underneath the
	grill.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Workin' on it.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the panic room, Meg is sitting cross-legged on the floor,
	leaning against a wall, but Sarah is in motion, sorting
	through shelves, opening drawers.  Every drawer has something
	in it, sealed under plastic.  She opens and closes, sorts and
	lifts finds the following:
	
	Waterproof matches and lighters.
	
	Flashlights.
	
	Unopened packages of batteries.
	
	Sealed water bags stamped "PURE FIVE YEARS FROM DATE."
	
	Tinned food.
	
	Flares.
	
	Pillows, fireproof blankets (we know because the bags are
	stamped FIREPROOF BLANKET).
	
	A complete tool kit.
	
	As Sarah explores, she discovers something in the far wall at
	the end of the room, down on the floor at eye level.
	
	It's a small round portal, about eight inches across, with a
	four-pronged cloverlike seal.  The portal is closed tight, as
	Sarah pokes and scrapes at it idly with a finger or two, it
	resists her attempts to crank it open.
	
	Meg notices.
	
	                     MEG
	          Hey.  Relax, okay?
	
	But Sarah keeps at it, feels along the edges of the portal,
	then all along the wall, looking for some kind of hidden
	switch that controls it.
	
	                     MEG
	          I mean it, lie down.  You get your
	          adrenaline up and you know what's
	          gonna happen.
	
	Sarah stops, looks at her mother, who is pale and wan,
	huddled in the corner.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Are you freaking out?
	
	                     MEG
	          Little bit.  Yeah.
	
	Sarah looks around the room.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Small space?
	
	                     MEG
	               (nods, fast)
	          Don't though.
	               (talk about it, that is)
	
	Sarah looks at her, thinks.  It's not an unfamiliar
	situation, her needing to comfort her mother.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Why did the chicken cross the road?
	
	                     MEG
	          What am I, a five year old?
	
	                     SARAH
	          Why did the chicken cross the road?
	
	                     MEG
	          I don't know, why?
	
	                     SARAH
	          To prove he wasn't chicken.
	
	Meg tries to push a smile across her face, but it's
	immediately dashes as she looks back at the video screens.
	Her eyes show alarm, staring at the kitchen.
	
	                     MEG
	          What the hell are they doing?
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	The contents of one of the satchels is dumped out over the
	kitchen counter, every kind of tool imaginable, many that are
	unfamiliar to us.  They sort through the pile, choosing
	things.
	
	INT.  KITCHEN FLOOR - REAR DOORS - NIGHT
	
	At the French doors that lead to the garden, Burnham has a
	cordless screwdriver and a pile of long screws in his hand.
	He reaches up, drills a screw through the door, into the
	corner of the door frame.  He does the same at the bottom of
	the door.
	
	He unlocks the doorknob, tries it.  The screws hold the door
	fast.  He moves on, to the next door.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the panic room, Meg stares at the video screens, eyes
	wide, terrified.  She watches them.  Can't take her eyes off
	them.
	
	                     MEG
	               (barely audible)
	          ... locking us in...
	
	INT.  LIBRARY - NIGHT
	
	In the library, in the front of the house, Raoul screws shut
	a window, driving the long screws into its frame.  He looks
	out at the street, at two CLUBGOERS walking home.
	
	He pulls the drape.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg's hands are over her mouth, she's trembling, shaking her
	head from side to side.  This can't be happening.
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	In the kitchen, Junior goes to the wall phone Meg used to
	call for pizza earlier.  He cuts the phone wire with a
	knife.
	
	He stands there, staring at the phone, wiping the sweat from
	his palms on his pants.  Not satisfied, he pulls the phone
	itself out of the wall, cuts the cord for the handset too.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg pushes herself back into the corner of the panic room,
	horrified.  Sweat has broken out on her forehead, her whole
	body seems to vibrate.  Sarah comes over, leans in front of
	her.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Mom?
	
	But Sarah's voice is hollow, seems far away.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Are you okay?
	
	Meg looks at her.  As she watches, Sarah floats away from
	her.  In fact, the entire room is floating away from her,
	elongating.
	
	And narrowing.  Meg looks to the sides, and the walls don't
	just seem like they're pushing in on her, they are pushing in
	on her.
	
	Meg opens her mouth, screams, but no sound comes out.
	
	Sarah stands up and bends over her, but now she's just a
	figure far away, all the way at the end of a long, impossibly
	narrow hall.
	
	                     SARAH
	               (barely heard)
	          MOM?!  MOM!!
	
	Meg crawls out, into the middle of that hallway, to get away
	from the wall, but they both continue moving in on her.
	
	                     MEG
	          Not here... not here... someplace
	          else... someplace else...
	
	Her eyes roll back into her head, we see just the whites, and
	she loses her balance, falling over onto her back.
	
	We fall with her, move in tight on her face, and the dark
	hallway carpet beneath it turns to green, all green, grassy
	green.  She sits up, looks around, and we realize she is in
	fact somewhere else, she's --
	
	EXT.  GREAT LAWN - DAY
	
	-- in the middle of the Great Lawn, in Central Park.  She
	stands, turns in a circle, she's completely alone on the
	great green grassy plain in the middle of a beautiful spring
	day, tall buildings sparkling in the distance.
	
	Meg stretches her arms out, smiles, but far off in the
	distance, she hears a voice calling to her, dimly:
	
	                     SARAH (O.S.)
	          Mom?!  Mom!!
	
	Meg ignores the voice, she's so happy to be out here, out in
	the open, in the beautiful wide open, she could stay here
	forever, she spins around, throws her head back, but there's
	that voice again, insistent:
	
	                     SARAH (O.S.)
	          Mom, please!!
	
	There is the sharp sound of a SLAP, and Meg's face abruptly
	jerks to the side.  She touches her cheek, confused, as a hot
	red handprint rises up on it.
	
	What the hell was that?
	
	BAM!
	
	Now the perfect spring day is shattered suddenly by a
	deafening CRUNCH.  The smile vanishes from Meg's face, she
	turns.  Where did that come from?
	
	BAM!  Another one, even louder.  Meg's whole body winces at
	the sound.
	
	BAM!  A third one, and on this one Meg falls to her knees,
	covering her ears, walls spring up around her, right there on
	the Great Lawn, we rush in on her, the walls close in, and
	she's right back --
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	-- in the panic room, where she always was, and that pounding
	is real, it's right outside the door, it's like somebody's
	trying to smash their way right through the wall.
	
	Sarah is right over Meg, holding her by the arms, and that
	handprint on Meg's face is real, Sarah must have slapped her
	to try to bring her out of it.
	
	                     SARAH
	          THEY'RE COMING IN!  THEY'RE COMING
	          IN!
	
	Meg looks to the wall, watches it seem to vibrate as another
	deafening BANG crunches into it from outside.
	
	BAM!  BAM!  BAM!  The sound is deafening.  Sarah throws both
	hands over her ears.  Meg looks around, still disoriented.
	
	                     SARAH
	          YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  YOU CAN'T FREAK
	          OUT LIKE THAT!  YOU HAVE TO STAY
	          HERE WITH ME!
	
	                     MEG
	          I am.  I'm here.
	
	                     SARAH
	          YOU HAVE TO!
	
	                     MEG
	          I'm here.  I'm here.
	
	They huddle there, terrified.  Meg blinks, wipes the sweat
	from her forehead, begins to come back around.  She turns her
	head, sneaks a look at the funny wristwatch Sarah wears,
	tries to look without her daughter knowing.  It's not an
	ordinary watch, it only has one number, a tall, flashing
	digital display:
	
	120
	
	Meg nods, as if reassuring herself.
	
	                     MEG
	          We're fine.  We're okay.
	
	She turns, looks at the video monitors to see what the hell
	they're doing out there.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	BAM!
	
	In the master bedroom, a claw hammer CRUNCHES into the
	sheetrock on the outer wall of the panic room.
	
	The intruders are in the master bedroom now, and Burnham is
	like a man possessed, tearing at the sheetrock with the sharp
	end of the tool while Junior shines a flashlight into the
	hole.
	
	As the sheetrock tears away, we see the skeleton of the wall
	behind it.  There's a latticework of two by four studs, and
	beyond those the dull shine of the wall's metal core.
	
	But that's not what he's after.  He continues tearing,
	reveals an air duct running through the wall, feeding into
	the panic room through a welded hole in the steel.  Burnham
	tears away with the hammer, exposing a short section of the
	duct.
	
	CLANG!  The claw hammer drops into an opened toolbox.
	Burnham drops to his knees, rips open another tool case.
	This one has a sophisticated looking power drill in it, along
	with a couple dozen specialized bits.  He selects one, twists
	it into the drill.
	
	At the wall, Burnham puts drill to metal and hits the switch.
	A horrendous METAL SCREECH fills the air and the drill bit
	tears into the duct, opening up a jagged hole about the size
	of a quarter.
	
	Raoul hurries through the doorway of the bedroom, carrying a
	coiled garden hose.  Burnham snaps his fingers for it, Raoul
	tosses it to him, holding one end, and the hose uncoils in
	the air as it snakes across the room.
	
	Burnham shoves the end of the garden hose into the hole he's
	just drilled in the air duct.
	
	RIP!  He tears off a length of duct tape and seals the
	connection, makes it airtight.
	
	SLIT!  Using a large hunting knife, Raoul hacks a ten foot
	section of the garden hose off the coil.
	He stretches it out, across the room, to the white five
	gallon tank we saw before, which is now sitting on the floor
	up here.  We move in close as Burnham snugs the cut end of
	the garden hose over a spigot at the top of the tank.  Red
	block letters are easy to read on the side of the tank.
	
	PROPANE
	CAUTION - FLAMMABLE
	
	Along with a number of other dire warnings.
	
	Burnham raises his hand to the knob, hesitates, doesn't
	really want to do this, but doesn't stop himself either.
	
	He spins it open.  Halfway.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Open it.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I did.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          He said open it.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Just sending a message.  She'll get
	          the point.
	
	Gas HISSES through the spigot and into the hose.  We follow
	along the length of the hose, across the floor of the room,
	through the hole in the sheetrock, into the hole that's been
	drilled in the air duct --
	
	INSIDE THE WALL
	
	-- through the wall itself, where we see the horizontal lines
	of an air vent up ahead.  We squeeze between two of the
	horizontal lines --
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	-- and come out in the panic room.  Three red streamers, tied
	to the air vent, flap to life as the gas HISSES into the
	panic room.
	
	Directly underneath the vent, Meg is hunched up against the
	wall, her arm around Sarah.
	
	She sniffs.
	
	Again.
	
	Sarah sniffs.
	
	They look at each other.
	
	She looks up.  Sees the streamers floating above her.
	
	She leaps to her feet, steps up onto a shelf, and stretches
	her nose toward the streamers.  Just as she does --
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Near the tank, Raoul shoves Burnham out of the way.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          We ain't playin', here.
	
	He cranks the valve handle of the grill open all the way.
	The gas pours into the hose with an audible WHOOSH.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg, at the vent, falls back, two lungfuls of propane, and
	drops to her knees on the floor.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What, what, what is it?!
	
	                     MEG
	          On the floor!  Get on the floor!
	
	Now Sarah coughs.  The gas is pouring into the room.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Raoul is standing guard over the tank, to make sure no one
	messes with the valve.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Look, don't be stupid...
	
	Junior has his head pressed against the door to the panic
	room, trying to hear any sounds from within.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Be quiet.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          We're trying to scare them, not kill
	          them!
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          They're coughing.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          They're gonna die in there!
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Nobody is gonna die, man, will you
	          please have the balls to follow
	          through with a good idea?  Think
	          about it, what would you do if you
	          were them, stay in there and choke
	          to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're
	          just getting them to come out for
	          forty-five minutes, forty-five
	          fucking minutes!  The worst that's
	          gonna happen is they pass out, we
	          drag 'em out here into the fresh
	          air, and they'll be fine.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are
	          we supposed to get into the room if
	          they pass out?
	
	Pause.  Junior turns to Raoul.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Cut it back a little bit.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          No fucking way.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          He's right, we can't get into the
	          room if they're dead!
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg and Sarah are down on the floor, rags covering their
	mouths, trying like crazy to filter the air, but it's not
	working.  Sarah is crawling around the base of the wall, near
	to where she was before, clawing at the strange portal thing
	again.
	
	Finally, she finds a small metal handle, folded back into the
	clover-leaf seal on the portal.  She unfolds it, twists it.
	
	The portal cranks open, revealing it to be at the end of a
	tube, about a foot long, an emergency ventilation source
	directly through to the exterior of the house.  She bends
	down and looks through it.  It's covered by a metal mesh at
	the opposite end, but she can see and smell the outside
	through it.
	
	She sits up, gestures to her mother to bend down next to her.
	She does, and they both jam their mouths up near the end of
	the tube, gulping fresh air greedily.
	
	Meg looks at Sarah, good job, and they both drop to the floor
	at the portal and suck air.  It's temporary, but it works.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the master bedroom, the debate has turned physical.
	Burnham lunges across the room at Raoul, to get his hands on
	the valve, to turn off the gas.  But Raoul catches him and
	hurls him aside.
	
	Burnham SLAMS into the wall, bounces off and SCREAMS at
	Raoul, who SCREAMS right back.  Junior leaps into the middle,
	trying to break it up, to get them to shut up, keep their
	voices down.
	
	It's bedlam.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the panic room, Meg knows this can't go on forever.  She
	turns away from the portal, looks up at the vent, where the
	streamers still stream.
	
	She looks to the other side of the room, to where Sarah found
	the waterproof matches and lighters.
	
	She thinks.  Takes a deep lungful of fresh air from the tube
	and crawls over to the lighters.  She selects one, snatches
	up a screwdriver.
	
	Sarah looks at her, has a vague idea of what she's thinking,
	but can't believe it.  She shakes her head vehemently.
	
	In response, Meg picks up two or three of the fireproof
	blankets and piles them over Sarah, right up to her
	disbelieving eyes.  She bends down, takes another gulp of
	air.  but she's getting woozy.  This can't go on much longer.
	
	She staggers across the room, hoists herself back up onto the
	shelf she stood on before, and gets right up next to the
	vent.  Holding her breath to avoid breathing the toxic gas,
	she unscrews the vent cover.
	
	The duct is wide enough to put your arm in.  She reaches in,
	past a bundle of multicolored wires that run down through the
	wall.  She reaches all the way in, lighter in hand.
	
	INSIDE THE DUCT,
	
	we see her hand crawl in, lighter clenched between her
	fingers.  She raises a thumb to the flint wheel, cranks it
	once.
	
	Too slow.  Not even a spark.
	
	Her hand shakes.  She tries again.  Still no spark.  But with
	the effort and the angle, when she thumbs the lighter it
	makes her hand twitch, banging up against the sides of the
	duct with a hollow BOOM.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham turns abruptly.
	
	He turns around.  They all freeze, listening.  He hears it
	again.  The hollow BOOM, coming from inside the wall.  Now a
	third time.
	
	He walks forward, slowly, toward the wall.
	
	BOOM.
	
	He moves closer, gets right up next to the wall.  He leans
	into the wall, putting his ear right up next to the air duct.
	This close, he hears the sound in more detail, realizes it's
	two sounds.
	
	SCRATCH.  BOOM.
	
	He arches an eyebrow.
	
	INSIDE THE DUCT,
	
	Meg's hand is trembling, tiring.  She tries again, thumbs the
	flint wheel.  It SCRATCHES as it rolls, her hand twitches,
	BOOMS against the side of the duct.
	
	Still, the gas HISSES through.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg's face is turning color, she's running out of air.  Her
	feet tremble on the shelf, she's about to lose her footing.
	
	INSIDE THE DUCT,
	
	she tries again.  SCRATCH.  BOOM.
	
	IN THE BEDROOM,
	
	Burnham's eyes suddenly pop wide as he identifies the sound.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Oh.
	
	He tears himself away from the wall --
	
	INSIDE THE DUCT,
	
	-- Meg's thumb tenses for one good hard turn --
	
	IN THE BEDROOM,
	
	-- Burnham leaps through the air, hurling himself toward the
	propane tank --
	
	INSIDE THE DUCT,
	
	-- Meg cranks the wheel, a spark sparks, a flame flames, and
	a hot blue cloud shoots out in two directions, one toward the
	panic room, the other toward the bedroom.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg jumps off the shelf, throwing herself as far away from
	the vent as she can, her arm engulfed by licking blue flame.
	She drops to the floor of the room, covering her daughter's
	body just as the entire ceiling of the panic room turns into
	a lake of fire with a deafening WHOOMP.  The fluorescent
	light tubes EXPLODE, showering glass everywhere.
	
	IN THE BEDROOM,
	
	the blue flame shoots out of the wall, into the hose, through
	the hose, backing up toward the tank.
	
	Burnham CRUNCHES to the floor next to the tank, knocking the
	other end of the hose away from the spigot just as the blue
	flame erupts from the end of the hose.
	
	The flame engulfs his entire body, his hair starts on fire,
	his chest, his arms.  Raoul lunges forward, Junior tears the
	blankets from the bed and throws them over him, Burnham HOWLS
	and rolls on the floor in pain.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	the blue cloud on the ceiling suddenly evaporates with
	another angry WHOOMP, leaving a few little pockets of flame
	that Meg extinguishes by swatting with a blanket.  Only one
	of the fluorescent lights is left intact; it casts a
	flickering, uneven light on the room.
	
	She stands in the middle of the still-smoky panic room,
	breathing hard.  She shouts, SCREAMS incomprehensibly, making
	no sense whatsoever.
	
	She stops, noticing the look Sarah is giving her.  Wide-eyed
	admiring, frightened, you are an insane woman.
	
	Meg looks to herself.  Her arm is signed, the hair burned
	off.  The sleeve of her T-shirt is burned back to the
	shoulder.  Her face is sooty, blackened.
	
	Meg GRUNTS, half frightened by herself.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Out in the bedroom, it's worse for Burnham, who has lost most
	of his hair and shirt.  But his skin isn't badly burned,
	which is something, I guess.
	
	Still, he's in a rage.  He POUNDS the metal door of the panic
	room.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I'M COMING IN THERE, BITCH, I AM
	          COMING IN THERE!  I AM COMING IN
	          THERE!
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg whirls, goes to the door herself, SCREAMS right back.  We
	can hardly make out a word she's saying, but it sounds
	threatening.
	
	Suddenly, she stops, hearing something else.  Outside the
	door, Burnham continues to rant, but there's a second sound,
	a sound coming from the long wall of the panic room, the wall
	that's shared with the brownstone next door.
	
	It's a faint -- very faint -- POUNDING sound, along with a
	high pitched, complaining voice, so faint it can hardly be
	heard.  Sarah hears it too.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Neighbor!
	
	Meg and Sarah leap as one, facing the common wall, SHOUTING
	at the tops of their lungs -- get help, call the police,
	please, call the police, that sort of thing.
	
	They shout and shout, but the soft pounding continues, and if
	their voices are as soft on the other side as the COMPLAINING
	VOICE is on this side, they have no hope.
	
	Their voices crack and they begin to cough, too irritated by
	the gas to shout for very long.  Long after they stop, the
	soft POUNDING from next door continues.
	
	Their pleas are not heard.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	The Intruders have stopped their racket too, and are
	listening carefully at the common wall.  Eventually, the soft
	POUNDING stops, the complaining voice complains no more.
	
	Burnham stands there, in pain.  Things are falling apart.
	Raoul stands in the doorway, silhouetted by the hallway
	light.  He draws himself up to his full, bulky height.  He's
	big.
	
	                     RAOUL
	               (to Junior)
	          We're gonna talk.  Downstairs.
	
	Junior nods and starts out.  Raoul lets him pass, but when
	Burnham tries to follow him, Raoul puts a big hand on his
	chest stopping him.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You stay.  Make sure she don't come
	          out.
	
	Burnham swallows.  But stays.
	
	Raoul turns, follows Junior downstairs.  As he descends, he
	looks up, making eye contact with Burnham.  And holding it.
	Something on his mind, that's for sure.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	THUNK.  Meg's head falls back against a wall; she sags to the
	floor, legs folded in front of her, completely drained.
	
	But Sarah's not drained, Sarah's full of nervous ingenuity,
	rustling around through the stuff in the panic room, an idea
	forming in her head.  She finds a powerful-looking flashlight
	and loads it up with batteries.  She tries it, flashing
	around the room.
	
	Halogen bulb, very powerful, hurts her mother's eyes as she
	flashes it past.  Meg watches her.  What's she up to?
	
	Sarah lays on the floor in front of the ventilation tube she
	discovered earlier.  She squints through it.
	
	THROUGH THE TUBE,
	
	she can see out of the house, into the courtyard behind the
	brownstone.
	
	About thirty yards away she can see the backs of the
	brownstones on the next block, and directly across (because
	the tube doesn't leave much room for lateral vision) she can
	see straight into somebody's bedroom.
	
	There's a light on.  A SLEEPING MAN is in bed, an open book
	on his chest.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah sits back.
	
	She grabs the flashlight, looks for a little button on the
	top, the kind you can flick the flashlight on and off with.
	Shining it on the wall of the panic room, she flashes it at a
	wall, three times, on and off.  Satisfied, she turns back to
	the tube.
	
	Meg, curious, crawls across the floor to join her.  Sarah
	shoves the flashlight all the way into the tube, leaving
	enough room on either side of it for them to see through.
	Meg lays down flat, squints into the tube, Sarah alongside
	her.  She looks at her daughter, curious -- your plan?
	
	Sarah reaches into the tube, finds the little flash button on
	the top of the flashlight.
	
	THROUGH THE TUBE,
	
	the piercing halogen beam begins to flash, across the
	courtyard and into the bedroom of the Man in the bedroom.
	The light flashes on the wall over his bed.
	
	The flashes are in a rhythm.  Short.  Short.  Short.  Long.
	Long.  Long.  Short.  Short.  Short.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg turns to Sarah, impressed.
	
	                     MEG
	          Morse code?
	
	                     SARAH
	               (nods)
	          Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot
	          dot.
	
	                     MEG
	          Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
	
	                     SARAH
	          "Titanic."
	
	THROUGH THE TUBE,
	
	the flashes continue -- dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot
	dot.  But the Man continues to sleep, the light on the wall
	behind him has no effect.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah is frustrated.  She adjusts the flashlight.
	
	THROUGH THE TUBE,
	
	the beam of light lowers jerkily from the wall until it is
	shining directly into the Sleeping Man's eyes.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah strains to keep the light in that perfect spot.  She's
	starting to sweat.  Meg leans over, sneaks a peek at the
	watch Sarah wears on her left wrist.  The readout:
	
	114
	
	THROUGH THE TUBE,
	
	the Sleeping Man stirs.  Opens his eyes.  Winces from the
	light, which is flashing directly in his eyes.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	                     MEG
	          Got him!
	
	                     SARAH
	          Come on, come on...
	
	THROUGH THE TUBE,
	
	the Sleeping Man sits up.  Raises a hand, trying to block the
	light, which keeps flashing on him.
	
	He gets up, out of bed.  He comes to the window.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	                     MEG
	          Yes, yes, yes, yes...
	
	Sarah keeps it up, flashing faster.
	
	THROUGH THE TUBE,
	
	they see the Man come all the way to his window.  He leans
	against it, cups his hands so he can see better.  The flashes
	continue, right on top of him now.
	
	Clearly, the Man is reading the flashes!  He takes a steps
	back from the window --
	
	-- gives them the finger --
	
	-- and angrily yanks shut his drapes.
	
	A moment later, the light goes out and the room is black.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg and Sarah drop their heads to the carpet, defeated.
	
	Sarah rolls over, knocks the flashlight away, stares up at
	the ceiling.
	
	Meg puts a hand in her hair.  It was a good idea.
	
	                     SARAH
	          We're never getting out of here.
	
	                     MEG
	          Shhh...
	
	She looks at the wristwatch again.
	
	103
	
	She's concerned.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham is concerned as well.  He's still in the master
	bedroom, but barely, he's standing in the doorway, straining
	like hell to hear a conversation that Junior and Raoul are
	having in the foyer, one floor one.
	
	They're trying to keep their voices down, but stray words
	float up through the open stairwell -- words like "him" and
	"warning" and "dangerous."
	
	Burnham chews a fingernail.  If only he could get closer.  He
	throws a look back at the door to the panic room.  He looks
	back out the bedroom door.  Listening.
	
	INT.  FOYER - NIGHT
	
	Junior and Raoul are huddled together in the foyer.  They're
	keeping their voices low, but their conversation is heated.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          We're not gonna do anything about
	          him, he's fine.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          If you think I'm gonna let my half
	          of the fourteen million bucks slip
	          away because of --
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          "Half?"  What did you, take a nap in
	          math class?  Three people, three
	          shares, one third.  Four point six
	          six six repeating.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          I'm just saying, the man is a
	          problem.  And he's your problem.
	          Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your
	          idea, none of this was your idea, it
	          was mine, it's my family we're
	          ripping off, it's my prick
	          grandfather who built that fucking
	          room, it was my idea to get the
	          plans, I found the floor safe, and
	          it was my idea to ask a guy who
	          builds these rooms to help break
	          into one!  Me, me, me, I, I, I, at
	          no point did I say "you" or Raoul,"
	          got it?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          He puts his hands on me again I'll
	          bury a slug in his ear.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          No, you will not, because without
	          Burnham there's no way in hell we're
	          gonna get into that safe, so as far
	          as I'm concerned he can paint your
	          ass blue and run it up a flagpole
	          and you won't lay a finger on him,
	          you understand me?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Don't take no tone of voice with me,
	          Homes.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          What is this shit you're talking all
	          of a sudden?  You're a bus driver,
	          "Homes," you live in Flatbush, so
	          please don't start spouting some
	          Elmore Leonard shit you just heard
	          because I saw that movie too,
	
	ON THE VIDEO MONITORS,
	
	Junior and Raoul are visible, still arguing in the foyer.
	
	On the next monitor over, Burnham is visible, standing in the
	master bedroom doorway, listening.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg is watching the monitors, thinking.  She notices
	something, sits forward abruptly, looking at the monitor that
	covers the master bedroom.  She squeezes right up close,
	staring at the screen.
	
	ON THE MONITOR,
	
	we peer closely at the box next to her bed, the one she was
	using for a night table.  On top of the box, she sees the
	charger for her cellular phone, sitting empty.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg sits back, eyes alive with an idea.  If only she could
	get to that phone, which must be still under the bed.  She
	looks back at the monitors, at Burnham lingering in the
	doorway to the room.
	
	                     MEG
	          Damn.
	
	She turns away from the monitors, to check on Sarah, who's
	settled into a corner of the room, looking pale.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the bedroom, Burnham is desperate.  The argument
	downstairs is entering round two, and he's got to hear what
	they're saying.
	
	He takes a few steps out of the bedroom --
	
	INT.  THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	-- and comes into the hallway.  He leans over the stairwell.
	Where he's standing, he is directly under the camera that
	covers the hallway --
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	-- and can't be seen on the monitor that covers the hallway.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg turns back from Sarah, to look at the monitors again.
	She see Burnham is no longer in the bedroom.  And doesn't
	appear to be in the hallway, either.
	
	                     MEG
	          Oh yes, yes...
	
	She looks at another monitor.
	
	ON THE MONITOR,
	
	she sees Junior and Raoul in the foyer.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg sits back.  That leaves Burnham unaccounted for.
	
	                     MEG
	          ... the hell is he?
	
	IN THE HALLWAY,
	
	Burnham is still lingering under the camera.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah has come forward to the monitors as well.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Do it.
	
	                     MEG
	          Yeah, but where's the third guy?
	
	                     SARAH
	          Not in the bedroom.  Do it!
	
	Meg goes to the door, raises a hand to the green "open"
	button.  Hesitates.
	
	IN THE MASTER BEDROOM,
	
	we see Burnham, lurking in the hallway, just about six feet
	from the door to the panic room.  Don't open that door!
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg wipes sweat from her palm.
	
	                     MEG
	          If it looks like I can't get back,
	          just close the door.
	
	                     SARAH
	          No.
	
	                     MEG
	          Close it!
	
	Sarah nods, looks back to the button.
	
	IN THE HALLWAY,
	
	a shouted CURSE rises up from downstairs.  Burnham takes a
	step toward the stairs.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	he suddenly appears, in the hallway.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah sees it.
	
	                     SARAH
	          WAIT!
	
	Meg freezes.  She looks at the monitor, wide-eyed.  Close
	one.
	
	IN THE HALLWAY,
	
	Burnham can't take it anymore.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Oh, hell...
	
	He turns and takes off down the stairs.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	Burnham flies down the stairs and appears in the foyer, next
	to Junior and Raoul.   
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg and Sarah see all three men accounted for, downstairs.
	
	                     SARAH
	          GO GO GO!
	
	Meg leaps up, runs to the door, and punches the green button.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	The door begins to crank open, Meg slips through the gap
	sideways before it's even all the way open.  She darts across
	the room --
	
	-- slides to the floor next to the bed --
	
	-- and flattens herself, reaching underneath it to get the
	phone.  Damn, that phone slid far, it's right in the middle,
	wouldn't you know it.
	
	IN THE FOYER,
	
	the three men hear her footsteps, as one, they take off for
	the stairs.
	
	IN THE MASTER BEDROOM,
	
	Meg continues to stretch, her fingers inches from the phone.
	
	ON THE STAIRWELL,
	
	feet race up toward her --
	
	IN THE MASTER BEDROOM,
	
	Meg's fingernails paw the phone, pull it closer to her.  She
	grabs it, stands --
	
	IN THE HALLWAY,
	
	the three men come off the stairs and race toward her, they
	see her as she lunges across, toward the panic room, she
	hurls herself through the door --
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	-- and Sarah SMACKS the red button.  The steel door closes
	with a deafening WHANG.
	
	Safe.
	
	IN THE ENTRYWAY,
	
	the echo of the metallic WHANG reverberates through the
	house.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the panic room, Meg punches 9-1-1 on her cell phone with
	trembling fingers.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	The big empty charger cradle is in the foreground when the
	three men burst into the room.  Burnham stops in the middle
	of the floor, turns in a frantic circle.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          What'd she get, what'd she get,
	          what'd she get...
	
	His eyes fall on the empty charger.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Cell phone.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Shit!
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg raises the cell phone to her ear --
	
	-- and gets a rapid busy signal.
	
	                     MEG
	          Oh, no.  No, no, no no no no no...
	
	She looks at the phone.  It's showing just one signal bar,
	and even that one is flashing on and off.
	
	                     MEG
	          Oh come on, come on, come on...
	
	She walks around the room, raises the phone high and low,
	trying crazily to find a signal.
	
	But can't.   
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the bedroom, Burnham stands just outside the door,
	fingertips lightly resting on it, the ghost of a smile on his
	face.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	               (softly)
	          I don't think we'll be talking on
	          our cell phone from in there...
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Inside the room, Meg doesn't seem upset.  Rather, she's
	staring at the cell phone in her hand, thinking.  Remembering
	something.
	
	                     MEG
	          Wires...
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	At the same moment, Burnham is having the same thought.  He's
	still at the door, fingertips still resting there.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Phone...
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	                     MEG
	          ... wires.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham looks down, at the baseboard below.  What is he
	looking at?
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg steps up, onto the shelf she climbed earlier, and comes
	up next to the vent.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What are you doing?
	
	                     MEG
	          I saw something, I saw...
	
	In the vent, alongside the duct, she sees the bundle of
	multicolored wires she saw earlier.
	
	                     MEG
	          ... phone wires!
	
	She jumps down off the shelf, goes to the tools, starts
	searching for something.
	
	                     MEG
	          I may not have hooked up the phone
	          in here, but I hooked up the main
	          line, and there's a jack at the base
	          of this wall outside, I saw it!
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Yes, that is correct, there is in fact a jack in the base of
	the wall outside the door to the panic room.
	
	Burnham bends down into frame, studying it, thinking the same
	thing she is.  He clears his throat.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Say, while we're on the subject of
	          phones...
	
	He turns, looks up at Junior.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          When I said cut the line, did you
	          cut the main line at the junction
	          box in the basement like I said, and
	          which I repeated, or did you just
	          cut the cord on the phone in the
	          kitchen?
	
	Pause.  Swallow.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          I, uh, I...
	
	Shit.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          ... hit a little snag finding the
	          one in the basement.
	
	Shit.
	
	Pause.  Then, as if a starting gun has been fired, Burnham
	leaps to his feet and races out of the bedroom.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	That same starting gun has been fired in the panic room.
	With a strong RIP, Meg pulls the whole bundle of multi
	colored wires out of the wall and drops onto the floor with
	it.  She trusts it at Sarah, finds a wire cutter in the
	assorted tools, and gives her that too.
	
	                     MEG
	          Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue
	          first, blue is phones!
	
	                     SARAH
	          Blue is phones?
	
	                     MEG
	          Yes, no, I don't know, do 'em all!
	
	While Sarah goes to work on the wires, Meg turns to the phone
	itself, the one with the buried phone line that isn't working
	yet.  She rips the phone out of its housing, tears free the
	wire on the end of it.
	
	INT.  ENTRY FLOOR - NIGHT
	
	Burnham flies down the stairs from the third floor, races
	across the foyer, flies down the stairs to the kitchen floor.
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	Burnham races across the kitchen floor, whips open a door and
	heads down another, narrow, darkened stairway.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg and Sarah are like animals, clawing and tearing at the
	ends of their respective phone cables, foregoing tools and
	stripping the wires with fingers and teeth, it's faster.
	
	With the phone receiver cradled on her shoulder, Meg starts
	twisting the ends of wires onto the exposed ends of the wires
	from the phone unit.  First wire -- nothing.  She tries a
	second wire.
	
	INT.  MECHANICAL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham SLAMS open the door to a dark room, pulls the string
	on a bare bulb.  Burned out.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          God damn it!
	
	Without light, he can't see a thing.  He SMACKS the bulb, it
	swings wildly, SMASHES on the cement wall.  He turns and
	races out of the room.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg tries another wire.  Still no dial tone.  Sarah shoves
	another wire at her.  She tries again.  Nothing.  She moves
	on.
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham slides to his knees, snatches a flashlight from his
	duffel, leaps up and takes off again.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Another wire.  Nothing.  Another wire.  DIAL TONE!
	
	Meg SHRIEKS and punches 911.
	
	INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT
	
	Burnham flies down the stairs, flashlight beam bouncing
	crazily in front of him.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	The phone is ringing.  An operator picks up.
	
	                     OPERATOR
	          911 emergency --
	
	                     MEG
	          I'm at 26 West --
	
	                     OPERATOR
	          -- please hold.
	
	It's a mechanical voice, which gives over to MUZAK.
	
	                     MEG
	          NO!
	
	INT.  MECHANICAL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham BANGS through the door again, starts searching the
	darkened mechanical room, shining harsh light around its
	dingy walls.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	MUZAK continues to play.
	
	                     MEG
	          Damn it!
	
	No more time to hold.  Meg hangs up the phone, dials another
	number, a seven digit one she knows by heart.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Call Dad!
	
	                     MEG
	          On it!
	
	INT.  MECHANICAL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the mechanical room, the bouncing flashlight beam falls on
	a metal cabinet across the way.  Burnham runs to it, flings
	it open.  Circuit breakers.  SLAMS it shut.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg listens as a phone rings on the other end.  And rings.
	And rings again.
	
	This is torture.
	
	INT.  MECHANICAL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham turns, sees another, smaller metal box, this one
	clearly labeled:
	
	PHONES
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	On the other end of the phone, a husky MALE VOICE answers;
	clearly he's been awakened.
	
	                     VOICE
	          Hello?
	
	                     MEG
	          Listen to me!  There are three --
	
	INT.  MECHANICAL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	With a subhuman ROAR of anger, Burnham rips the entire phone
	panel off the wall with his bare hands.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	With an abrupt SHRIEK, the line goes dead.  Meg pauses, can't
	believe it.
	
	                     MEG
	          Hello?  Don't... are...
	
	She looks up, see Sarah looking at her, her eyebrows arches,
	her face all hope.  Meg keeps her cool, but it take a hell of
	an effort.
	
	Sarah reads her face.  She turns away.
	
	She hangs up the phone.
	
	Sarah goes to a corner of the room, faces away from her.
	
	Meg doesn't know what to say.
	
	                     MEG
	          He'll do something.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Uh uh.
	
	                     MEG
	          He'll know we're in trouble.  He
	          heard me, I said "There are
	          three..."
	
	                     SARAH
	          He won't even know who it was.
	
	                     MEG
	          What would you think, in the middle
	          of the night?  I mean, three what,
	          three bears?  He'll call the police.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Stop it.
	
	                     MEG
	          He's just across the park, this is
	          why we got places so close to each
	          other, in case we needed each other,
	          we're still a family, he'll help
	          us...
	
	                     SARAH
	          He --
	
	                     MEG
	          He WILL.
	
	She practically shouted.  Sarah drop her head into her arms.
	
	                     MEG
	          I'm sorry.
	
	                     SARAH
	          I'm sorry.
	
	                     MEG
	          Why?
	
	                     SARAH
	          I was trying not to tell you...
	
	                     MEG
	          What?
	
	                     SARAH
	          I'm dizzy and thirsty.
	
	Meg blanches.  This is very bad news.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Tired, Burnham drags himself back up the stairs and into the
	doorway of the master bedroom.  Raoul and Junior stand there,
	staring at him.
	
	Long pause.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          She's never coming out.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Hey.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          And we're never getting in.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Do me a favor and don't talk.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Jesus, what was I thinking?
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg has torn open one of the water packets and is trying to
	get Sarah to drink, but the little girl has gone completely
	pale and seems to have lost some of the strength in her neck,
	she's having trouble holding her head up.  Most of the water
	runs down her chin.
	
	                     MEG
	          Come on, come on... stay with me...
	          you gotta drink...
	
	She takes Sarah's hand, checks her wristwatch thing.  The
	readout is now
	
	82
	
	She swallows.  She grabs Sarah by the face.
	
	                     MEG
	          Okay, listen, honey, you went double
	          digit here, you must have been
	          shooting out adrenaline like crazy,
	          we gotta bring your blood sugar back
	          up, okay?  Can you hear me?
	
	                     SARAH
	          I'm dizzy, not deaf.
	
	                     MEG
	          Hey, she's still a smart ass,
	          excellent sign.  Did you see any
	          sugar in here?  Any candy bars,
	          anything sweet?
	
	                     SARAH
	          Huh uh.
	
	                     MEG
	          Okay, you just gotta calm yourself
	          down, that's all, just stay calm and
	          your adrenaline will go back to
	          normal and you'll be fine.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What if I keep dropping?
	
	                     MEG
	          Not an option.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What if I do?
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the bedroom, Junior has had enough.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          We're leaving.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          The hell we are.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Hey man, after all we went through I
	          am not walking out when we're this
	          close.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Close?  Are you insane?  We're
	          nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll
	          make an anonymous phone call on
	          Monday, they'll find the floor safe,
	          and I'll inherit the shit.  Little
	          piece of it, anyway, it's better
	          than nothing.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          What about us?
	
	Junior thinks, then pulls out his wallet.  He thrusts a
	fistful of bills at them.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Here.  For your time.
	
	They both just stare at him.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Five hundred bucks here.
	
	Neither one of them moves to take it.  Junior shurgs, drops
	it on the floor.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Suit yourself.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Nobody leaves.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Observe.
	
	He heads for the door, expecting Raoul to block him, but as
	he draws close --
	
	-- Raoul just steps out of the way.  Junior passes through
	and heads for the stairs.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          We're not leaving.  I'm getting in
	          that room, and I'm opening that
	          safe.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but
	          ten out of ten for attitude.
	
	And he disappears, down the stairs, Burnham still pleading
	with him.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg rifles the foodstuffs that are stored in the room.
	Sarah, in the corner, is starting to tremble.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What if I spazz out?
	
	                     MEG
	               (forced calm)
	          No biggie, we've been through it a
	          dozen times, I just jab you with the
	          Glucogen.
	
	Pause.  She keeps looking.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Where is the Glucogen?
	
	                     MEG
	          Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the

	                     SARAH
	               (pause)
	          I'm sorry, Mom.
	
	                     MEG
	          Hey, quit apologizing, you're
	          starting to sound like Grandma.
	          You're not gonna have an attack.
	          Okay?
	
	                     SARAH
	          Okay.   
	
	She lays back, oddly passive, her lips changing color.  She
	stares at the monitors.
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Junior strides into the living room, purposefully.  He tosses
	some tools into his duffel bag and heads for the stairs down
	to the kitchen.  Burnham is behind him.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Would you wait?  Would you please
	          just wait a minute?
	
	But Junior heads down.  Burnham follows.  Raoul is just
	coming down from upstairs.
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	Junior reaches the door of the kitchen, tries to open it,
	realizes it's screwed shut.  He takes out a screwdriver and
	starts unscrewing the screws.  Burnham stops at the stairway.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          You walk out that door and you lose
	          your share of the money.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Yeah, whatever.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I mean it!
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Adios.
	
	He gets the last screw out, throws open the door, and BLAST
	of wind gusts in, it's a blustery night out there, he takes a
	step into the doorway --
	
	-- and with a quiet PFFFT from right behind Burnham, a bullet
	whizzes across the kitchen and hits Junior in the back of the
	head.  He crumples, right in the open kitchen doorway.
	
	Burnham SHOUTS incoherently and turns.  Raoul is standing
	there, two steps up, a silencer twisted onto the barrel of
	his gun.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Nobody leaves.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Sarah is staring at the video monitors, eyes wide.  She
	raises one trembling finger, points at the kitchen monitor,
	tries to mouth the words, can't.
	
	Meg looks up.
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	Burnham is freaking out, but trying to stay calm.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Oh God... oh, my God...
	
	Raoul walks past him calmly, grabs Junior by the ankles, and
	drags him back into the house.  He turns, looks at Burnham,
	whose jaw is dropped in horror.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You should see the look on your
	          face.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          The fuck did you do that for?!
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Fuckin' asshole, thinks he knows me.
	          Drives his German car up to 125th
	          Street a couple of times, buys a few
	          rounds, thinks he's a tough guy,
	          thinks he knows me.
	               (to the corpse)
	          You don't know one thing about me!
	
	While Burnham stares down at the body in shock and Raoul
	stares at Burnham, his back to the outside, a small, thin
	VOICE comes from the still-open doorway.
	
	                     VOICE
	          What the h --
	
	They turn.  A man, fiftyish, stands there in hastily thrown
	on clothes, staring down at the dead body in mute shock.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg, watching the monitors with Sarah, GASPS as she sees the
	man, whose name is HARRIS.  While she and Sarah watch --
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	-- they see the silent image of Harris, set upon by Raoul,
	who grabs him roughly and drags him inside.  Burnham hurries
	to the door --
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	-- and SLAMS it shut.  He puts his back to it, thinking,
	terrified, things are spinning out of control, fast.
	
	Raoul, in the middle of the kitchen floor, is venting some
	more of his rage on Harris, whom he has hurled to the floor.
	He lands a solid boot in the side of Harris's head, leaving
	him GROANING in pain, completely disoriented.
	
	Harris rolls groggily into the spreading pool of blood coming
	from underneath Junior.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Stop it!  Stop it!
	
	                     RAOUL
	               (turning on him)
	          Who's the clown now?  Huh?!  Who's
	          the fucking clown now?!
	
	He pulls his gun, shoves it into Burnham's eye, hard, we can
	hear the faint SIZZLE of skin burning.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Me.  I am.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          That's right.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          I have the gun.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Yes.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Remember that.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Please...
	
	Raoul pulls the gun back, just an inch.  The skin around
	Burnham's eye is an angry red.  His eyes dart, strain to look
	over at Harris, MOANING on the floor.  And at Junior, dead.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          What?  What do you want me to do?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          What do you think?  Get us into that
	          room.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I can't.
	
	Raoul pushes the gun barrel back into Burnham's eye socket.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You can.  You're full of ideas.  You
	          just need to squeeze one out.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I can't...
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You got till the count of three.
	          Then you end up like him.
	
	He tilts his head over to Junior, whose brains are spreading
	out on the kitchen floor.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          One.  Squeeze.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          This is ridiculous...
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Two.  Squeeze harder.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I can't just...
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Th --
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Okay, okay!  Okay.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You got an idea?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Yeah.  Yeah, I got an idea.  I gotta
	          check something.
	
	Raoul GRUNTS, satisfied.  Pulls the gun back.  Burnham slides
	away, shaking.  He bends down, to the floor.  He looks at
	Harris's left hand.  At his index finger.
	
	He sees a white strip of skin, where Harris wore his wedding
	ring, until recently.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Harris, still semi-conscious, is hurled against the metal
	door of the panic room.  He collapses at its base.  Burnham,
	bends down next to him.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Okay, look.  I know you can hear me.
	          Your wife and kid are in there.
	          You're gonna get 'em to come out.
	          Or --
	
	He looks up at Raoul, hulking overhead, gun in hand.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Or I can't stop what he's gonna do.
	          Do you understand?
	
	Harris, regaining some semblance of consciousness, nods
	feebly.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Good.
	
	Burnham stands up, turns to the video camera, and SHOUTS.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          OPEN THE GOD DAMN DOOR!
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Sarah and Meg see the horrifying sight on the video monitors.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham SHOUTS at the door to the room.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          OPEN UP!
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	they see Burnham, standing over Harris; they faintly hear him
	call to them to open the door.
	
	And then they hear another VOICE, calling back to them.
	Sarah sits up, recognizes her father's voice.
	
	                     SARAH (O.S.)
	          DADDY!
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Harris is SHOUTING against the closed door.
	
	                     HARRIS
	          DON'T DO IT!  NO MATTER WHAT
	          HAPPENS, DON'T OPEN THE DOOR!
	          DON'T O --
	
	He's silenced by a vicious kick to the ribs.  Raoul begins to
	beat him.
	
	Burnham stands by, powerless, horrifies, watching as Raoul
	savages Harris, who continues to call out, as long as he has
	strength, telling Meg not to open the door, no matter what.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg and Sarah SHOUT in horror, she covers her daughter's
	face, turn her away from the screen, SCREAMS in incoherent
	anger of her own.
	
	But she doesn't open the door.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham SHOUTS at Raoul, pleading.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          STOP IT, MAN, STOP IT, THAT'S HIS
	          KID IN THERE, HIS KID IS WATCHING
	          THIS!!
	
	But Raoul whips the gun up, into Burnham's throat, backing
	him off, shutting him up.
	
	He resumes his pounding of Harris.
	
	Burnham turns, looks up at the camera in the corner of the
	room.
	
	He can't stand it anymore.  He whips off his jacket, runs to
	the camera, and covers the lens.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	While Meg watches, the monitor that cover the master bedroom
	abruptly goes black, mercifully sparing them the sight of
	Harris's beating.
	
	She holds Sarah, who's sobbing, shaking.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Harris finally lapses into unconsciousness.  Raoul stands
	over him, chest heaving.
	
	Burnham stand in the doorway, neither in nor out of the room,
	a silhouette, head hung.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg tries desperately to see something on the bedroom
	monitor, but it's hopeless, it's covered.  On the hallway
	monitor, she can just see shadows, as two men in the bedroom
	lift a third off the floor and carry him across the room.
	
	A sudden BEEPING sound tears her attention away.  Still
	holding Sarah, she pulls her back, off her shoulder.  Her
	face is completely white, her lips blue, her eyes rolled back
	into her head.  The BEEPING sound grows louder, she checks
	Sarah's wristwatch, the reading is dire:
	
	57
	
	Meg GASPS, horrifies.
	
	                     MEG
	          Oh God, oh my God...
	
	Sarah begins to convulse, she bucks right out of Meg's arms
	and falls back onto the floor of the panic room.  Meg clears
	everything away from her, tries to make room for her.
	
	The convulsion worsens.  Meg searches through the piles of
	supplies, comes up with a plastic-handled screwdriver.  She
	opens Sarah's jaws, wedges the plastic handle between her
	teeth.
	
	She helps Sarah ride out the convulsion.  Finally, her eyes
	roll back into her head, she slowly re-orients herself.
	Sarah reaches over, turns off her still-BEEPING
	wristwatch/monitor herself.
	
	Sarah sighs, a shuddering sigh of relief, but she is nowhere
	near normal.
	
	Her skin has passed through white and is turning a sallow
	yellow color.  She moves her lips, Meg can't hear her, she
	bends down:
	
	                     SARAH
	          You gotta jab me, Mommy...
	
	Meg turns, looks back at the monitors.  What she sees is good
	news --
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	the jacket has been removed from the bedroom camera.  Burnham
	and Raoul are gone, the only person there is HARRIS, who lies
	slumped on the far side of the bed.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg looks quickly over at the monitor for the living room.
	
	ON THAT MONITOR,
	
	she sees Burnham and Raoul having an urgent conversation,
	Burnham sitting in a chair, Raoul pacing in front of him,
	ranting.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg's face lights up, she practically laughs, she's so
	overjoyed at this turn of events.
	
	She turns, looks back at Sarah, who is starting to tremble
	again.
	
	That does it.  Meg leaps up, hits the button that controls
	the steel door, and it starts to crank open, almost
	impossibly slowly.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg steps out of the panic room, into the master bedroom.
	She looks at Harris, on the bed.  With his back to her she
	can't even tell if he's alive or dead, but first things must
	be first, so she turns and races out of the room.
	
	INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	Meg flies up the stairs, bare feet on padded carpet.
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the living room, Raoul looks up, hearing the pitter-pat of
	her feet on the stairs above.
	
	He smiles and pulls his ski mask back on, to cover his face.
	
	Coming around behind him, we see Burnham sitting in the
	chair.  Except it isn't Burnham at all, it's Harris,
	unconscious, wearing Burnham's shirt.
	
	And if Harris is the person in the chair, that means --
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	-- the person on the bed in the bedroom is Burnham, wearing
	Harris's shirt.  His eyes pop open, he sits up, sees the wide
	open door to the panic room.
	
	INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg races into Sarah's bedroom and tears open the door of a
	mini-fridge.  Inside are dozens of little bottles of insulin
	and something called Glucogen.
	
	She grabs a bottle of Glucogen and a black leather pouch and
	takes off.
	
	INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	As Meg nears the bottom of the stairs, she sees a horrifying
	sight.  It's Raoul, ski mask over his face, standing in the
	doorway of the master bedroom.
	
	She SCREAMS, he SLAMS the door, she takes off down the hall,
	reaches the end, throws the door open --
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	-- and races into the master bedroom, where Raoul is
	motoring, fast, headed for the panic room, where she can
	already see Burnham, standing in the middle of the open
	doorway, in front of Sarah, wearing Harris's shirt and a grim
	"tricked you" expression.
	
	Meg hurls herself at Raoul, lands clinging to his back.  She
	claws and wrestles with him, gets one hand on his ski mask,
	tears it from his head.  He reaches up to try to stop her
	from pulling it off --
	
	-- his gun slips from his fingers, falls to the floor --
	
	-- and caroms off his boot, spinning across the floor away
	from them.
	
	Raoul flips her off his back violently, she CRUNCHES to the
	floor, clutching his mask and getting a good long look at his
	face.  He makes a move toward his gun, but she's faster,
	she's already pawing herself frantically across the hardwood
	toward it.
	
	Raoul measures the distance, knows he'll lose, and sprints
	for the panic room instead.  Meg turns, looks down at the
	medicine in her hands, then at the door to the panic room,
	where Raoul is right now reaching up to push the button that
	controls the steel door.
	
	She makes a fast decision and lunges, hurling the plastic
	bottle of Glucogen and the black leather pouch through the
	gap just before --
	
	-- the spring-loaded steel door SLAMS shut with tremendous
	ferocity.
	
	And then it's silent.  Meg WAILS in agony, POUNDS on the
	door.
	
	She stands back, chest heaving, sobbing.
	
	A looooong moment goes by.
	
	Finally, a VOICE comes over the house's intercom system.
	
	                     RAOUL (O.S.)
	               (calmly)
	          If you leave the house, we'll kill
	          her.
	
	Meg sobs.
	
	                     RAOUL (O.S.)
	          If I see a uniform in the house,
	          we'll kill her.
	
	                     MEG
	          Oh... oh...
	
	                     RAOUL (O.S.)
	          You understand?
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	Meg looks up at the camera in the master bedroom.  She nods,
	terrified.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Burnham pushes past Raoul, at the speaker button, and leans
	forward.  He's approaching exhaustion.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	               (into speaker)
	          I just... I just need forty-five
	          minutes.
	
	Raoul stands behind him, muttering to himself.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Saw my face, man.  Saw my face.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	we see Meg's face, agonized, as she lunges toward the camera,
	SCREAMING something up at it, the same thing, over and over.
	But in here her voice is nearly muted, what bleeds through
	the walls isn't enough to be heard.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Raoul looks at her image on the monitor, irritated.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Shut up.
	
	IN THE MASTER BEDROOM,
	
	we abruptly hear her voice, full-throated.
	
	                     MEG
	               (shouting into the camera)
	          -- cine, she needs the MEDICINE!
	          GIVE HER THE --
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah shivers in a corner, knees pulled up to her chest,
	staring at the intruders, scared out of her wits, and looking
	very, very sick.
	
	Burnham looks at her, musters the most reassuring face he can
	come up with under the circumstances.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          It's gonna be cool, kid.  Be outta
	          here before you know it.
	
	No response from Sarah.  Burnham cocks a head, really looking
	at her.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Are you okay?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
	
	Burnham turns, grabs his satchel, and drops to his knees in
	the middle of the floor.  Over his shoulder, we can see the
	face of Meg on one of the monitors, shouting into the camera,
	begging them to give Sarah her medicine.
	
	Using his hand, Burnham measures six lengths in from the
	wall, then digs his fingernails into the weave of the carpet,
	looking for a seam.
	
	He finds one, gets hold of it on one edge, and runs his other
	hand along the seam till he finds a place where it seems to
	turn a corner.  He stands, hovering over the carpet, and
	pulls back evenly with both hands.
	
	The concealed carpet flap pulls back neatly, with the soft
	sound of tearing VELCRO.  Underneath the flap --
	
	-- is the smooth metal door of a floor safe.
	
	Burnham unsnaps his satchel and gives it a shove.  It rolls
	out and opens up onto the floor, revealing a neat array of
	safecracking tools.
	
	He begins his delicate work, but is suddenly jarred by a
	POUNDING on the metal door.  He turns, annoyed.  Meg is still
	SCREAMING outside the door.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          The hell does she want?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          I don't know, she keeps screamin'
	          the same thing over and over.
	
	Burnham turns, looks at the monitors.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	Meg is staring up at the camera, miming the act of giving
	herself an injection in the arm.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Raoul laughs.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Drugs.  She wants drugs.  What the
	          fuck?
	
	But Burnham thinks.  His eyes fall on the bottle and the
	leather pouch she hurled through the door, then whip over to
	Sarah, who sags over into a fetal position on the floor.  Her
	lips are moving.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Oh, man...
	
	He crawls over to Sarah, puts his ear down next to Sarah's
	lips.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          What is it?
	
	Sarah tries to summon enough strength to speak, but her
	breath comes hard.
	
	                     SARAH
	          I need...
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Yeah?
	
	                     SARAH
	          ... 'jection...
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          An injection?
	
	Sarah nods.  Burnham points to the pouch and the Glucogen, on
	the floor nearby.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          That stuff?
	
	Sarah nods again.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Can you do it yourself?
	
	Sarah shakes her head no.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Well, I don't know how.
	
	Sarah looks at him, eyes pleading.  Raoul stands behind
	Burnham.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          I don't fucking believe this.
	               (to Sarah)
	          You gotta wait.
	
	Sarah just looks at Burnham.  Please.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a
	          little more, and your mom'll give it
	          to you.  You can wait a half hour,
	          can't you?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's
	          just like, tired, she's gotta rest.
	          You rest, Kid.  Half an hour.
	
	Sarah looks terrified, shaking her head no.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Come on.
	
	He starts to pull Burnham away, but Burnham shakes his hand
	off, violently.  He bends down very close to Sarah's lips.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Tell me the truth, okay?  What's
	          gonna happen if you don't get this?
	
	Sarah swallows, licks her cracking lips.  When she speaks,
	it's breathy, almost inaudible.
	
	But the words are clear.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Coma.  Die.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Seen from overhead, Meg paces in the master bedroom, out of
	her mind with worry, no idea how to communicate to the people
	in the room the desperate situation.
	
	Suddenly, a VOICE comes over the intercom speaker.
	
	                     BURNHAM (O.S.)
	          I understand.  I'll give her the
	          shot.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	A HAND comes down into frame and picks up the Glucogen and
	the leather pouch.  Burnham stands, looking down at them.
	Raoul grabs him, pulls him to the far end of the room.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You're wasting your fucking time,
	          man, you're wasting my time.  You
	          don't know how to do this, and the
	          longer we stay in here, the more
	          likely she's gonna lose it and call
	          the cops!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Are you gonna open the safe?
	
	Raoul looks at him.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Then shut up and get out of my way.
	
	As Burnham crosses the room, Raoul makes eye contact with
	Sarah, who is staring at him.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Don't look at me.
	
	ACROSS THE ROOM,
	
	Burnham drops to his knees next to Sarah and unzips the
	pouch.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Okay, kid, all I know about this is
	          what I've seen on TV, you gotta talk
	          me through it.
	
	Sarah tries to form words, but she's too weak.  Burnham
	swallows.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Okay.  No talking.  No problem.  TV
	          don't lie, right?
	
	He reaches into the pouch, take out a syringe, a sterile pad,
	and a length of rubber tubing.  He takes Sarah's arm,
	stretches it out, exposing the underside of her forearm.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          You seem like a good kid.  Your
	          mom... only saw her for a second,
	          but, woah.  Beautiful, huh?
	
	No answer.  Burnham ties the rubber tubing around Sarah's
	arm, pulls it tight.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Hey, nod or something, show me
	          you're still alive, will ya?
	
	Sarah nods.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Attagirl.  That too tight?
	
	Sarah shakes her head no.  Burnham takes the syringe, starts
	to fill it from the Glucogen bottle.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          You guys are pretty rich, huh?
	
	Sarah shrugs.  While Burnham goes through the process of
	finding an exposed vein and giving the injection itself, he
	goes on, as much to comfort Sarah as to comfort himself:
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Yeah, you don't think about that
	          stuff.  Good for you.
	
	He looks at her, sees her looking at him.  Thinking about
	him.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I know, I know.  I really screwed
	          the pooch this time.  I never did
	          anything like this before.  Break
	          into somebody's house?  Not even
	          close.  Bad cards, Kid.  I swear to
	          God, I been on the wrong end of
	          maybe six straight years of bad
	          cards.  House.  Car.  Wife.
	               (snaps his fingers --
	                gone)
	          Those are some seriously bad cards.
	          And still, every time I pick up a
	          fresh hand I swear to God, the rush
	          comes so hot and prickly I feel it
	          right down to my toes because this
	          time, this one time, it might be
	          there, this time it might be that
	          hand, that perfect hand, that
	          monster hand.
	               (shakes his head)
	          And you thought you were sick.
	
	The shot successfully given, he pulls Sarah's sleeve back
	down.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Feel better?
	
	Sarah nods, and she seems better already.  Burnham helps her
	to sit up, to lean against the wall.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Woulda been a hell of a dad.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	A VOICE comes over the intercom in the master bedroom.  It's
	Raoul.
	
	                     RAOUL (O.S.)
	          She's okay.  Now sit down and wait.
	
	He CLICKS off.
	
	Meg is hugely relieved.  And extremely pissed off.  She goes
	to the corner of the room and picks up the gun, the one that
	Raoul dropped.
	
	She heads downstairs.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Sparks fly as Burnham goes to work on the floor safe with a
	small, specialized drill.
	
	Raoul bends down next to him.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Congratulations.  You saved her life
	          for ten minutes.
	
	Burnham looks up at him -- what?  But Raoul turns and walks
	away.
	
	Burnham goes back to work.
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg is in the living room, with Harris, who is still slouched
	in the chair.  He's in awful shape, barely conscious.
	
	Out of the silence, a sudden, deafening sound.
	
	The DOORBELL.
	
	Her eyes go wide.  She darts a look over to the door (the one
	that leads to the stoop, not the bloody kitchen door
	downstairs), then back at Harris.
	
	                     HARRIS
	          Police.
	
	                     MEG
	               (gasps)
	          You called the police?
	
	He nods.
	
	                     HARRIS
	          You... scared...
	
	Shit.  This is exactly what she prayed for him to do, now
	it's the worst thing that could happen.
	
	She stands, thinking, desperate.  She walks toward the door,
	stops, thinks some more.
	
	The doorbell RINGS again.
	
	She comes up with a plan.  She goes back to where Harris is
	in the chair, pulls the chair back a few feet, out of view of
	the door.  She puts the gun in his lap, puts his hand over it
	to steady it.
	
	She leans down, WHISPERS to him.
	
	                     MEG
	          Don't.  Say.  A word.
	
	He nods.
	
	Meg takes a breath, walks across the foyer, tousling her hair
	as she goes.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Raoul is staring at the monitors, aghast.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Holy shit... holy shit...
	
	Burnham races over, looks over his shoulder.  One monitor
	covers the front stoop, and on that monitor they can clearly
	see TWO UNIFORMED COPS.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          She's fuckin' crazy, she killed the
	          kid!  She just killed her own kid!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          It's not her fault, it's not her
	          fault, the guy must have called
	          them.  Look, look, look, she's
	          telling us.
	
	He points to another monitor, the one in the foyer, where Meg
	is looking up at the camera, miming to them -- don't worry,
	I'll take care of this.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          She's gonna handle it.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          She better.
	
	INT.  ENTRY FLOOR - NIGHT
	
	Meg's shaking hand rises up to the doorknob and pulls open
	the big front door.  On the stoop, the two Cops turn to look
	at her.  She acts as if she's just been awakened.  She looks
	it, too, still in T-shirt and boxer shorts.  The wind is
	gusty and cold outside.
	
	                     MEG
	          Yeah?
	
	                     COP 1
	          Everything okay?
	
	                     MEG
	          Huh?
	
	                     COP 2
	          Are you all right?
	
	                     MEG
	          What are you guys -- what time is
	          it?
	
	                     COP 1
	          'Bout four o'clock.
	
	                     MEG
	          I don't get it.
	
	                     COP 2
	          We got a call...
	
	Cop 1 looks at him.  Cop 2 stops talking.
	
	                     MEG
	          Somebody called you?
	
	                     COP 1
	          Can we come in?
	
	                     MEG
	          What do you want?
	
	                     COP 1
	          We'd like to come in.
	
	                     MEG
	          No, you can't come in.
	
	                     COP 2
	          Are you okay?
	
	                     MEG
	          I'm fine.
	
	                     COP 1
	          Can we come in?
	
	                     MEG
	          Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who
	          called you?
	
	                     COP 1
	          You don't look so good.
	
	                     MEG
	          You wake me out of a sound sleep at
	          four in the morning and then tell me
	          I look like hell?  Of course I look
	          like hell, you don't look so hot
	          yourself, Jack.  I'm freezing here,
	          thank you for checking, can I go?
	
	Cop 1 studies her, notices the burned sleeve of her T-shirt,
	the black smudges still on her face.
	
	                     COP 1
	          Your husband says you said "There
	          are three..." right before you got
	          cut off.
	
	                     MEG
	          Oh, that phone call...
	
	Cop 1 takes a step forward and lowers his voice to just above
	a whisper, unconsciously making her lean forward in order to
	hear him.
	
	                     COP 1
	          Ma'am, if there's something you want
	          to say to us right now that maybe
	          you can't say to us right now, maybe
	          you just want to make a signal, by
	          blinking a few times, something like
	          that.
	
	She just looks at him.  Wow, this guy's intuitive.  She is
	sorely tempted.  But she can't.
	
	                     COP 1
	          That's something you could do.
	          Safely.
	
	She thinks, thinks --
	
	-- and burst out laughing.
	
	                     MEG
	          Man, you are good!  You mean, like,
	          if somebody was in the house or
	          something?  That's great, they
	          really train you guys these days,
	          don't they?
	
	Cop 1 looks at her, not sure if he believes her or not.
	
	                     MEG
	          No.  I'm fine.  Cross my heart.
	
	Cop 2 turns to go, but Cop 1 lingers.
	
	                     COP 1
	          May I ask what the rest of that
	          sentence was going to be?
	
	                     MEG
	               (stalling)
	          Huh?
	
	                     COP 1
	          The sentence that started "There are
	          three."  What was the rest?
	
	Pause.  She stares at him.
	
	                     MEG
	          Okay, look.  My husband and I just
	          broke up.  It's my first night in
	          the new house, and I was feeling a
	          little lonely and a little drunk.
	          The sentence, if you insist on
	          knowing, was going to be "There are
	          three things I'll do for you if you
	          come over right now and get in bed
	          with me."
	
	Cop 2 stifles a laugh.
	
	                     MEG
	          But thank God I came to my senses
	          before I said all that and hung up
	          instead, so nobody would ever know
	          what I was thinking, unless, of
	          course, two policemen showed up in
	          the middle of the night to
	          interrogate me about it.
	
	That was good.  Cop 1 is embarrassed.  Cop 2 thinks it's
	funny.
	
	                     COP 2
	          You want her to show you which three
	          things, Rick, or should we just go?
	
	Cop 1 looks at Meg, a long look, he holds it for one last
	moment, trying to read her mind.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	we see the video image of the Cops as they turn and head away
	down the front steps.  Meg closes the doors, looks up into a
	camera, right at us.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Burnham and Raoul breathe a sigh of relief.
	
	Burnham goes back to work on the safe.  He's making progress.
	
	Raoul looks at Sarah.  Stares actually.  He's thinking too.
	
	Bad thoughts.  He moves over, crouches down next to Burnham.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          She saw my face.  The kid too.
	
	Sarah overhears that.  She raises her head, alarmed.  Burnham
	turns, looks over at her, and she just gets her head back
	down in time.  Burnham and Raoul close themselves off, for a
	private conversation.
	
	Sarah edges closer.  She overhears a fragment.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          That's your problem.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          That's their problem.
	
	Sarah is terrified.  Doesn't know what to do.  She looks to
	her immediate left, sees the intercom panel.  She edges
	closer.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Let me fucking finish this so we can
	          get out of here.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You finish.  Then we finish.
	
	Sarah sneaks up a hand and pushes a button -- "ALL PAGE."
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the living room, there is an audible CLICK as the speaker
	is activated.  Meg looks up, hears Burnham's voice, in the
	middle of a sentence.
	
	                     BURNHAM (O.S.)
	          -- posed to mean?
	
	                     RAOUL (O.S.)
	          You're here with me, you're already
	          on the hook for one.  Buy one, you
	          get the rest for the same price.
	          You know that.
	
	                     BURNHAM (O.S.)
	          Get the fuck away from me.
	
	                     RAOUL (O.S.)
	          The kid in here.  The other two when
	          we come out.
	
	Meg listens, horrified.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Sarah holds the intercom button down with a trembling finger.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Bullshit.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You know how this gotta end.
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg stares, in shock, as Raoul's voice echoes in the empty
	room.
	
	                     RAOUL (O.S.)
	          They stay in the house.
	
	There in an abrupt CLICK, and the speaker turns off.  Meg
	turns, goes to Harris, falls to her knees, no idea what to
	do.  She holds him close, their foreheads touching.  She's
	terrified, exhausted, wants to collapse in his arms.
	
	Instead, she starts to pull the gun from his fingers.  He
	tightens his grip, what are you doing?  He tries to hold onto
	the gun, but she pulls his fingers off it, takes it away from
	him.  He is too weak to resist.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the panic room, Sarah has her hands clamped over her ears,
	her mouth is wide open, and a hideous METAL SHRIEK seems to
	be coming out of it.
	
	But the SHRIEK is actually coming from the safe, where
	Burnham continues to work, another drill, a bigger bit.  The
	noise is deafening.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	Sarah sees her mother approaching the monitor in the bedroom,
	carrying a jacket.  Meg tosses the jacket, this time she
	doesn't want them to see what she's doing.
	
	The monitor goes black.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the master bedroom, Meg pulls on a pair of jeans that are
	hanging over a chair.
	
	She steps into a pair of boots.
	
	She shoves the gun into her belt.
	
	Here in the bedroom, she can hear the drill.  From the house
	next door, she hears POUNDING again, more MUFFLED CURSES.
	Apparently the neighbor can hear the drill too.
	
	Meg looks from the walls of the bedroom to the walls of the
	panic room.  Her eyes light up with an idea.
	
	She goes to the front wall of the bedroom, stands with her
	back against the exterior wall (street side), with her left
	shoulder against the common wall that's shared with the
	neighbor's brownstone.
	
	She begins to step off the distance, heel to toe, measuring
	with her feet until she reaches the metal door that is the
	entrance to the panic room.
	
	                     MEG
	          Fourteen.
	
	She hurries out of the bedroom.  What's she doing?
	
	INT.  LIBRARY - NIGHT
	
	Meg comes into a small room full of empty bookshelves, a
	library.  There is a window that looks out over the sidewalk,
	one floor up, same level as the stoop.
	
	She looks up, into the corners of the room.
	
	                     MEG
	          No camera, no camera, no camera...
	
	They're bare, no video cameras.  Good.
	
	She goes to the window, tries to open it.  Screwed shut, of
	course.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	The safe is almost cracked.  Raoul is watching the monitors
	carefully.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	we see Meg as she searches through the tools in the living
	room, finds a screwdriver, a sledgehammer.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Raoul furrows his brow.  Now what?
	
	INT.  LIBRARY - NIGHT
	
	Meg is back in the library, hurriedly unscrewing the window.
	She gets the last screw out, shoves the window up.
	
	The wind BLASTS in, it's a hell of a spooky night out there.
	
	She leans out the window.  We lean with her.  The sidewalk is
	empty (we see it only from our vantage point inside the
	house).  She's one floor up.  To her right is the house's
	front stoop.
	
	She tosses the sledgehammer over, onto the stoop.  Climbs up
	onto the window ledge, and slithers out herself.
	
	We lean further, watch her as she edges along the ledge, hops
	down onto the stoop, and freezes, staring in horror --
	
	-- at the video camera that covers the front stoop.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	we see her staring straight up at the camera, clearly
	standing on the front stoop, outside the house, where she was
	specifically told not to go.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah sees the image of her on the stoop.  Raoul happens to
	be looking away at the moment, at the safe, but he starts to
	turn around, to look at the monitors again --
	
	-- and Sarah kicks him, hard, in the ass.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Hey!
	
	He turns, away from the monitors.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Sorry.  Can't control it sometimes.
	
	Raoul scowls at her.  Behind him --
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	Meg darts down the front steps and disappears from view on
	the monitor.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah sees her mother go.
	
	                     SARAH
	               (to Raoul)
	          Won't happen again.
	
	INT.  LIBRARY - NIGHT
	
	Still leaning out the window, we can see Meg from here as she
	reaches the sidewalk and runs up the front steps of the
	neighbor's house, which is contiguous.
	
	Straining to see (yet stay in the house), we see Meg all the
	way at the right edge of the frame, as she shifts the gun to
	the back of her pants and knocks on the neighbor's door,
	sledgehammer held slightly behind her leg.
	
	After a long moment, we hear the neighbor's front door open.
	The conversation begins.  The wind is gusting right in our
	faces, we can't make out the details, but the gist is clear --
	let me into your house, and don't as me a lot of questions.
	
	The NEIGHBOR -- and by the tone of the voice it sounds like
	an old woman -- is slow to respond, grumpy.
	
	Losing patience, Meg just pulls the Neighbor out of the way
	and shoves into the house.  The Neighbor stumbles out onto
	her front stoop, and we were right, it's an old lady in a
	nightgown, but she's no shrinking violet.  In fact, she's
	royally pissed off and not at all intimidated.
	
	                     NEIGHBOR
	          What the hell do you think you're
	          doing, young lady?!
	
	She storms back into her house, following Meg.  As both of
	them disappear from the frame, we move out of the library,
	into the foyer, and move along the common wall, the one
	shared with the neighbor's brownstone.
	
	From the other side of the wall, we can hear muffled voices,
	arguing, Meg and the Neighbor shouting at each other.
	
	We drift up, up the stairs, and hear the THUNDERING of
	footsteps on the stairs next door.  We keep pace with them,
	from inside this house.  We pass right through the floor --
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	-- and rise up out of the floor in the master bedroom, and
	now we can hear the conversation on the other side of the
	wall in here, the Neighbor's fearful, angry tones, Meg's
	firm, urgent declarations.
	
	We move with Meg, even though we can't see her, we know what
	she's doing, she's stepping off the paces on the other side
	of the wall.  We drift down that wall, fourteen steps, until
	we reach the metal door to the panic room, then we pass
	through that door --
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	-- and arrive inside the panic room, where Burnham is this
	close to getting the safe open, when all of a sudden --
	
	WHOMP.
	
	CRUNCH.
	
	Burnham and Raoul freeze, alarmed.  It's coming from the long
	wall, the shared wall.
	
	They look at each other.
	
	WHOMP.
	
	CRUNCH.
	
	They look at the wall.
	
	Somebody is on the other side, pounding like hell.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          The walls are steel, right?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Not that one.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          NOT THAT ONE?!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Hey man, it's the neighbor's house,
	          who breaks in through the neighbor's
	          house?!
	
	WHOMP!  CRUNCH!
	
	Louder.  Closer.  Burnham turns, SCREAMS at the wall.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE
	          NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!
	
	                     RAOUL
	          We've got the Kid!
	               (shouting at the wall)
	          WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck
	          is she thinking?!
	
	WHOMP!  CRUNCH!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          She's got your gun, that's what
	          she's thinking!  The FUCK you had to
	          bring a gun for?!
	
	Burnham throws himself back on the floor, goes back to work
	on the safe.  Fires up the drill again, it SCREAMS into the
	metal.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Almost there...
	
	The POUNDING keeps up from next door.  We hear sheetrock torn
	away on the far side.  Bricks, SCRAPING out of place.
	
	Sarah, in the corner, is energized, excited.  While Burnham
	and Raoul are distracted, she grabs the leather pouch, palms
	the three syringes that are left in there.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          ALMOST THERE...
	
	Finally, the door to the safe CRUNCHES in on one side,
	yielding to the drilling --
	
	-- at the very moment that the head of a sledgehammer CRASHES
	through the wall of the panic room.  Raoul grabs hold of
	Sarah, Burnham maintains his focus, throwing open the safe,
	revealing --
	
	-- nothing.
	
	CRUNCH!
	
	The sledgehammer head strikes again, opening up a hole about
	a foot across.  Light spills through from the other side, as
	well as the voice of the hysterical Neighbor.
	
	Raoul hurls Sarah against the far wall, leaps over to the
	side of the hole, and waits, poised above it.
	
	At the safe, Burnham doesn't lose his cool, just opens a
	false bottom in the safe, revealing a manila envelope.
	
	He snatches it up, RIPS it open, and his eyes dance as he
	holds up fourteen individual one million dollar U,S, Treasury
	Bearer Bonds.  He fans them out, eyes drinking from his
	Grail.
	
	BANG!
	
	A gunshot whizzes right through one of the bonds, setting it
	aflame before it SLAMS into the far wall, sending up a little
	cloud of plaster dust.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          JESUS!
	
	He whirls, sees an arm poking through the hole in the wall,
	gun extended.
	
	But Raoul is standing just above the hole, and already has
	his boot raised, over the hand.  He brings it down, a
	CRUNCHING blow that stomps right on Meg's wrist.
	
	Meg SCREAMS, loses her grip on the gun, and it CLATTERS into
	the space between the houses.
	
	BETWEEN THE WALLS,
	
	the gun falls into oblivion, the space between the walls,
	where no one can get to it.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Burnham shoves the loose bonds into his jacket.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I GOT THE MONEY, LET'S GO!!!
	
	Raoul grabs Sarah and turns, jabs the green button to open
	the door.
	
	Behind them, Meg SCREAMS in anger and wriggles through the
	opening.  Before she's even all the way through, she gets
	hold of Raoul's leg and pulls herself into the panic room,
	scraping and bloodying herself on the edges of the too-small
	hole.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          GO, LET'S GO, OUTTA HERE!!
	
	But Raoul is deep in a violent rage.  Still holding Sarah
	with one hand, he bends down, grabs Meg by the hair, and
	drags her toward the doorway.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
	
	He bolts out of the room, through the metal door, which is
	just finishing its slow crank open, its heavy spring coiling
	in the wall.
	
	Raoul drag Meg across the floor by the hair, right into the
	track of the open steel door.
	
	She looks up, sees the infrared safety beam over her head,
	and  realizes with horror what his intention is.
	
	Still with one arm holding Sarah, who is kicking and
	struggling viciously, Raoul holds Meg's head down on the
	floor, below the safety beam that would prevent the door from
	closing.  He reaches for the "close" button.
	
	Sarah raises her arm, stuffed with three syringes, and jabs
	them into Raoul's neck.  Raoul SCREAMS in pain.
	
	Meg manages to raise her head, breaking the beam.
	
	INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	On the stairwell, Burnham, stops, frozen, his face twitching
	with indecision.  He hears the murder taking place just above
	him.
	
	He runs down three steps.
	
	Stops again.
	
	Runs down the rest of the stairs.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Raoul stretches to push the red "close" button for the door,
	but he has to hold Meg's head down, out of the lower beam
	with one hand, all with Sarah savagely attacking him at the
	same time, and three syringes hanging out of his neck.
	
	Finally, he gets Meg's head all the way down, onto the floor.
	
	Looking up, Meg sees the red beam become complete again.
	
	Raoul jabs the button --
	
	-- just as Sarah throws her hand into the upper beam, the one
	at shoulder level.  Sarah's hand turns red, the beam is
	broken, the door will not close.
	
	Raoul ROARS in anger and twists violently, sending Sarah
	flying across the room.
	
	Meg strains, gets her head off the floor again, breaking the
	beam.  Raoul starts jamming the close button, over and over
	again, the beam completes, then breaks, completes, then
	breaks, never the button and the beam at the same time.
	
	But it can't go on forever.  Meg's tiring, she can't keep it
	up, her head trembles --
	
	-- and collapses onto the floor.
	
	The beam completes --
	
	-- Raoul SMACKS the red button --
	
	-- and Burnham appears on the other side of the door.  He
	reaches in, grabs hold of Raoul, to pull him off her, but
	Raoul loses his balance, falls forward --
	
	-- into the gap --
	
	-- and his head is crushed by the spring-loaded steel door
	that SLAMS forward just as Meg draws herself back.
	
	Meg falls across the panic room, grabs Sarah, and holds on
	tight.
	
	The door detects the obstruction and opens again, slowly.
	Raoul's body slumps to the floor, dead.
	
	Burnham stands there, looking down at Meg and Sarah.
	
	They stare at each other, wordless, their first face to face
	contact.  She sees the bonds protruding from his jacket.
	
	She just looks at him.  There will be no understanding here.
	
	He zips his jacket, turns, and hurries away.
	
	INT.  ENTRY FLOOR - NIGHT
	
	Burnham races down the steps, hurries to the entry door,
	throws it open --
	
	-- and finds a gun barrel pointed directly into his nose.  He
	blinks, tries to focus on whoever's on the other end of that
	gun.
	
	It's the Cop, the first Cop, the one who came to the door and
	was so suspicious of Meg.  The Cop looks down, sees blood
	smeared all over Burnham's jacket, sees more than enough to
	know his suspicions were correct.
	
	                     COP 1
	          Put your hands up.
	
	Burnham freezes, silhouetted in the doorway.  Wind and leaves
	blow into the house, a real gale outside.
	
	From behind Cop 1, MORE COPS SHOUT, all at once, must be a
	half dozen of 'em there, but Burnham can't see anything in
	the stinging light, and can't hear much either, over the
	ROARING wind.
	
	Burnham moves suddenly, flinging the door shut right in the
	Cop's face.  The door SLAMS hard, Burnham turns to run but
	doesn't get more than a few paces before three sharp GUNSHOTS
	CRACK through the door behind him.
	
	Brilliant white light spills through the bulletholes in the
	door, but it's not the light that gets you, it's the chunks
	of lead.  They rip through Burnham's back and come out his
	chest, a triangle pattern.
	
	Burnham stops, sags to his knees.  He reaches into his
	jacket, pulls out the loose stack of bonds.
	
	He fans them out, stares down at them, holds them like
	playing cards.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Monster hand.
	
	Behind him, the front door CRACKS open, half a dozen COPS
	appear and start SHOUTING, all at once.  Burnham tosses the
	bonds to the floor, the same gesture as folding a hand of
	poker.
	
	He GROANS and collapses, slowly, falling through the bonds,
	twisting as he goes down.  He SLAPS onto his back in the
	foyer as the wind gusts through the open door, scoops the
	bonds up off the floor, and blows them back into the house,
	as if they were never meant to leave.
	
	Burnham lies there on the floor, eyes open, staring up at the
	ceiling, looking at the bonds that swirl in the blast of air,
	suspended there, twisting and bucking and diving just over
	his head as he dies.
	
	                                             DISSOLVE TO:
	
	EXT.  CENTRAL PARK - GREAT LAWN - DAY
	
	The swirling bonds melt into swirling leaves, blowing in the
	air over Central Park on a crisp fall day.  The leaves float
	down, over the Great Lawn, that massive expanse of grass we
	saw in Meg's hallucination.
	
	But on a day like this the Great Lawn's full of people,
	throwing frisbees, playing football, lying there doing
	nothing.
	
	The leaves land on the grass next to Meg and Sarah, stretched
	out on a blanket, a newspaper spread in front of them, open
	to the ads.
	
	Meg is on her back, arms folded behind her head, staring up
	at the clouds.
	
	Sarah is intent on the paper, circling the occasional ad.
	
	                     SARAH
	          I mean, uptown is close to Dad's
	          place, but somebody at school said
	          the Village is really cool, so... I
	          don't know, it's so great to be
	          close to the park and everything...
	          What do you think, I mean, give me a
	          clue, here, where are we gonna live?
	
	Meg rolls over, props herself up on one elbow.  She seems
	years younger.  She looks at Sarah, reaches out, brushes her
	daughter's hair behind one ear.
	
	She smiles.  She is calm.
	
	Behind her, a flock of pigeons takes off, leaping into the
	clear autumn sky.
	
	                                                FADE OUT.

	                     This film is short.
	
	                     This film is fast.
	
	
	
	FADE IN:
	
	EXT.  MANHATTAN - DAY
	
	The whole island, from the south.  For a second.  Literally.
	
	EXT.  NEW YORK SKYLINE - DAY
	
	Closer, just the skyline.  For another second.
	
	EXT.  UPPER WEST SIDE - DAY
	
	Closer still, the Upper West Side.  For another second.  No
	time to waste admiring the scenery.
	
	EXT.  WEST 83RD STREET - DAY
	
	Race across a field of PEDESTRIANS to pick up three women
	hurrying down the sidewalk.  LYDIA LYNCH, a real estate
	broker, vaults down the sidewalk, she's got a hell of a
	stride.  MEG ALTMAN, thirtyish, struggles to keep up with
	her, she's tall, wafer-thin, pale as a ghost.  SARAH, a nine
	year old girl, flat out runs to keep up, dribbling a
	basketball as she goes.  The kid's athletic, much tougher
	than Meg, who she resembles.
	
	Lydia reads from a sheet she carries in her bouncing hands.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          -- seventeen feet wide, fifty-five
	          feet deep, forty-two hundred square
	          feet, four floors with a rentable
	          basement apartment, so five
	          altogether, courtyard in back --
	
	                     MEG
	          Could you slow down a little?
	               (looking back over her
	                shoulder)
	          Or we could wait for the car...
	
	                     LYDIA
	          No cars.  Feet are faster.
	
	                     MEG
	          How many more do we have after this?
	
	                     LYDIA
	          None, there's nothing else, you know
	          how tight the market is.
	
	                     MEG
	          This is it?  I told you on the
	          phone, I have to be moved in in two
	          weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce
	          that here.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Mom, it's the sidewalk.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          Oh, that miserable little prick is
	          already leaving.
	
	They approach a row of brownstones, narrow four story
	townhouses, nice looking buildings, a hundred years old or
	more.  EVAN, a sour-looking man, has just locked the front
	door of number 26 and is coming down the steps.  He sees them
	coming.
	
	                     EVAN
	          One day you will learn to respect
	          other people's time, Lydia, one day
	          you --
	
	                     LYDIA
	          Evan, I am so sorry, you were a
	          saint to wait for us!
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  TOWNHOUSE - FOYER - DAY
	
	Evan throws open the front door, revealing the airy foyer of
	the townhouse.  The place is completely empty.  He talks
	fast, races through the tour.  The three of them come in,
	Sarah still bouncing her basketball.
	
	                     EVAN
	          This is the middle of the house, the
	          entry floor, living room's over
	          there.  The kitchen floor's below us
	          and there's two bedroom floors
	          above.
	
	The front door closes behind them, with a THUD so
	authoritative it seems to say no one's ever getting out.  Meg
	tries to get her daughter's attention, to tell her to stop
	bouncing the ball in the house.
	
	                     EVAN
	          It's an enormous amount of space for
	          the money and I'll be perfectly
	          honest, the family is in no hurry
	          whatsoever.
	
	Meg whispers Sarah's name, but Sarah still ignores her, goes
	on bouncing the ball.
	
	                     EVAN
	          I don't have to tell you there is an
	          acute shortage of living space in
	          Manhattan right now and this is a
	          highly unique property.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          No ball, kid.
	
	Sarah immediately stops bouncing.  She wanders into the
	living room, peers through the big French doors, which look
	out over the courtyard area.  There's another row of
	brownstones on the next block, and all the patios back up to
	one another.  It looks tranquil out there, oasis in the city.
	
	Sarah leans up against the door, sighs, her breath fogs the
	window.  There is a profound melancholy about her.  Meg
	watches her, tries to catch eyes with her in the reflection.
	Can't.
	
	Evan flings open the door of an old-fashioned cage-style
	elevator.
	
	                     EVAN
	          Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine,
	          the previous owner, was disabled the
	          last ten years of his life.  Highly
	          unusual, the elevator, you will not
	          find this in ninety percent of
	          brownstones.
	
	                     MEG
	          Will they take asking price?  I need
	          a two week escrow and I'm already
	          approved for the loan.
	
	Lydia turns, gives Meg an "are you insane?" look.
	
	                     EVAN
	          What say we see the house before we
	          dicker, hmm?
	               (starting up the stairs)
	          I have to warn you, this is exactly
	          the response we expected to get.
	          It's a very emotional property.
	
	As he disappears upstairs, Lydia turns to Meg, lowers her
	voice.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          Who taught you to negotiate?
	
	                     SARAH
	          It's not like Saks', Mom, you don't
	          have to pay the price on the tag.
	
	She gets in the elevator and RATTLES the door shut with a
	bang.  That kid's got an attitude.  Meg takes a deep breath,
	turns to Lydia.  She brushes her hair behind an ear, we
	notice her thin hand is shaking.
	
	                     MEG
	          I'm sorry.  Apartments, and...
	          money, and... this is more my
	          husband's area.
	
	She digs in her purse for a prescription pill bottle and some
	water.
	
	                     MEG
	          Was.  His area.  I'm not very good
	          at...
	
	Lydia watches as she swallows a pill, waiting for Meg to
	finish her sentence.  Not very good at what?
	
	                     MEG
	          Things, and if I can't prove to my
	          soon to-be ex-husband that I can
	          provide a suitable place for our
	          daughter to live in the next
	          fourteen days, it's going to get
	          ugly between us.  Uglier.
	
	Lydia just looks at her, no idea what to say.  These two are
	from different places.
	
	                     EVAN (O.S.)
	               (from upstairs)
	          It would be so lovely if I could
	          shot the property before I leave!
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  TOP FLOOR BEDROOM - DAY
	
	Evan, Lydia, and Meg poke their heads in a series of rooms,
	one after the other, the tour flying by quickly.  First, an
	upstairs bedroom.  Nice, roomy, looks out on the courtyard.
	
	                     EVAN
	          Top floor.  Two bedrooms, one
	          bathroom.
	
	INT.  DEN - DAY
	
	Another floor, another empty room.  The trio passes through.
	
	                     EVAN
	          Third floor, spare bedroom, den,
	          what have you.  Mr. Pearlstine used
	          it as an office.
	
	                     LYDIA
	               (low voice, to Meg)
	          He's talking about Bernard
	          Pearlstine.
	
	Meg shrugs, who's that?
	
	                     EVAN
	               (moving, through a
	                bathroom)
	          Master bath.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          The hotel guy?  It's been in the
	          papers lately.  His kids are all
	          suing each other over his estate.
	          He was a total recluse, paranoid,
	          rich as hell, he was worth thirty
	          million or something, now it turns
	          out they can't find half of it.
	               (singsong)
	          Somebody took something didn't
	          belong to them!
	
	                     EVAN
	          I hardly see how family gossip is
	          germane to showing the property.
	
	                     LYDIA
	               (low, to Meg)
	          Stop calling it the property, you
	          sound ridiculous.
	
	                     EVAN
	               (through a closet)
	          Master closet.
	
	From the hallway, there is a GROANING METALLIC sound, the
	elevator, and the happy laughter of the little girl as she
	puts it through its paces.  Evan winces, speaks as if his
	mouth hurts when he moves it.
	
	                     EVAN
	          Could the child please stop that?
	
	                     LYDIA
	          KID!  NO ELEVATOR!
	
	She looks at Meg and winks.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
	
	                     EVAN
	          And we emerge in the master bedroom.
	
	He checks his watch.
	
	Meg looks around, studying the dimensions of the room.  She
	looks at the far wall, the one that borders the house next
	door.  She looks at the wall that corners it, opposite the
	window wall.  She takes two steps back from it.
	
	                     MEG
	          Something's weird.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          What?
	
	                     MEG
	          I don't know, doesn't that corner
	          seem funny to you?
	
	She points to the far end of the wall, near the entrance to
	the closet.  There is a mirrored door that leads to the
	closet, and a mirror on the wall alongside it.  If you look
	closely, you'll see that the mirrors are raked slightly
	toward one another, which causes an optical illusion in which
	the corner of the room appears much closer to the door than
	it is.
	
	                     EVAN
	          I was waiting to see if you'd
	          notice!  On caravan, no one from our
	          office had the slightest idea.
	
	He pushes on the top of the mirror on the wall.  It makes a
	faint CLICK, then glides open a few inches off the wall.  He
	pulls it toward him, opens it all the way, a hundred eighty
	degrees, and it fastens magnetically to the back of the
	closed door.  There is smooth wall behind it, but if you look
	closely, there is a faint vertical crack in the wall.
	
	Meg looks at him -- what in the world?  Even pushes again,
	twice this time, first at the top, then at the bottom, and
	the smooth wall CLICKS ajar.  He pulls it wide open.  Meg and
	Lydia step forward, fascinated.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - DAY
	
	From the opposite end of a lone, narrow, windowless space, we
	see the three of them standing in the open doorway,
	silhouetted by the sunlight streaming through the bedroom
	windows behind them.
	
	                     EVAN
	          It's called a panic room.
	
	He hits a switch and a row of bulbs flick on overhead.
	
	                     MEG
	          A what?
	
	                     EVAN
	          A safe room.  An inner sanctum.  A
	          castle keep, in medieval times.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          Oh, I've seen these...
	
	                     EVAN
	          It's quite in vogue in high end
	          construction right now.  One really
	          can't be too careful about home
	          invasion.
	
	The other two walk inside, but Meg lingers near the door,
	looking around, studying the neatly arrayed survival supplies
	-- water, food packs, batteries, flashlights, tools, rope,
	clothes, blankets -- you get the idea.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          Hey, this is perfect for you...
	               (Meg scoffs)
	          Absolutely!  You're a woman, you're
	          living alone now.  Your alarm goes
	          off, or you head glass break, or for
	          whatever reason you think someone's
	          broken into your home in the middle
	          of the night.  What are you going to
	          do?  Call the police and wait until
	          they get here on Tuesday?  Traipse
	          downstairs in your sexy little
	          underthings and check it out?  I
	          think not!
	
	                     EVAN
	          Reinforced steel core walls.  Buried
	          phone line, completely separate, not
	          connected to the house's main line
	          and never exposed throughout the
	          house's infrastructure or outside
	          the house -- you can call the
	          police; nobody can cut you off.
	          Your own ventilation system,
	          complete with oxygen scrubber, so
	          you've got plenty of fresh air for
	          as long as you like.  And a bank of
	          video monitors --
	
	He hits a switch next to a dozen tiny video monitors,
	revealing a dozen different views of the house.
	
	                     EVAN
	          -- covering almost every corner of
	          the house.
	
	Meg nods, starting to sweat.
	
	                     MEG
	          Makes me nervous.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          Why?
	
	                     MEG
	          Ever read any Poe?
	
	                     LYDIA
	          I don't think so, but I love her
	          album.
	
	                     MEG
	          No, Edgar Allen.
	
	                     LYDIA
	               (thinks)
	          The furniture guy?
	
	                     MEG
	               (giving up)
	          What's to keep them from prying open
	          the door?
	
	Evan reaches past Meg and pushes a red button on the wall
	behind her.  With a sudden WHANG of steel, a heavy metal door
	leaps out of a slot in the wall and SLAMS shut, like a
	submarine hatch.  A series of metal latches CLICK into place
	inside it, from top to bottom, securing it into place.
	
	                     EVAN
	          Steel, four inches thick.
	
	Meg takes a step back.  They're now enclosed in the room.
	
	                     EVAN
	          Everything's spring-loaded, even if
	          the power's out it's fully
	          functional.
	
	                     MEG
	          Open it.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with
	          this room, did he?
	
	                     MEG
	          Open the door.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          And with kids like he's got, no
	          wonder he wanted a place to hide.
	
	                     EVAN
	          That's highly inappropriate.
	
	                     MEG
	          I said open the door.
	
	Evan hits a green button and the door GROANS slowly open,
	recoiling its massive spring, and revealing Sarah, the little
	girl, standing in the entryway, grinning widely.
	
	                     SARAH
	          My room.  Definitely my room.
	
	She bolts in, just as her mother bolts out.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
	
	Meg stands just outside the door to the panic room, regaining
	her composure.  Not crazy about tight spaces.  Which we
	already knew.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          That door is a safely hazard.
	
	                     EVAN
	          Not at all.
	
	He points.  There's a tiny red beam that shines across the
	doorway, one at shoulder height --
	
	                     EVAN
	          Infrared.  Like the beam in an
	          elevator doorway.  Won't let the
	          door close if something's blocking
	          it.
	
	-- and one at shin height.  Even bend down, blocks the one at
	shin height with his hand.
	
	                     EVAN
	          Watch.
	
	He reaches up, to push the close button, but with one hand
	anchored at the floor, he can't quite reach it.
	
	                     EVAN
	               (to Lydia)
	          Push that button for me, will you?
	
	                     MEG
	          Don't!
	
	Lydia pushes the close button, nothing happens.  Evan pulls
	his hand put of the beam, takes a step back.  Lydia pushes
	the button again.
	
	WHANG!  The metal door rockets shut, the metallic slang
	reverberating in the room.  Almost immediately, the fake
	piece of wall HUMS shut, of its own accord, followed a moment
	later by the mirror, which detaches itself from the back of
	the closet door and HUMS silently back into place, closing
	over the hidden door, making the corner of the room look like
	a corner again.
	
	As the mirrored door closes, it shows Meg her own reflection.
	She looks at herself, still rattled.  She wipes a trickle of
	sweat from the side of her face.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  TOWNHOUSE - FOYER - DAY
	
	The same house, two weeks later.  The entry floor is piled
	high with moving boxes.  Sarah and Meg lie sprawled out in
	the middle of the black and white tile, arms and legs splayed
	wide, exhausted.
	
	They stare up at the ceiling, beat.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Too many stairs.
	
	                     MEG
	          Got us in here, didn't I?
	
	                     SARAH
	          Shoulda got an apartment.
	
	                     MEG
	          Well, I know that now.
	
	                     SARAH
	          478-0150.
	
	Meg raises her hand to her face, she's got her cell phone in
	her palm.
	
	                     MEG
	          Battery's dead.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - DAY
	
	Meg picks up the wall phone in the kitchen, gets a dial tone.
	
	                     MEG
	          The phone works.
	               (to Sarah)
	          Hey, I hooked up the phone.
	
	                     SARAH
	               (sarcastic)
	          The crowd goes wild.
	
	                     MEG
	               (ignoring the slight)
	          478...
	
	                     SARAH
	          0150.
	
	Meg finishes dialing.  It rings, someone answers.
	
	                     VOICE
	          Perry's Pizza, please hold.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	Night has fallen.  Meg and Sarah sit at a small table in the
	middle of the kitchen, surrounded by packing boxes.  They eat
	pizza.  They chew, silently.  Sarah drinks a diet Dr.
	Pepper.  Meg finishes a glass of wine.
	
	Meg's eyes are moist.  Sarah notices.  She notices her
	noticing, shrugs.  I'm human, what do you want me to do, hide
	it?
	
	Sarah looks away, goes back to chewing.  After a moment:
	
	                     SARAH
	          Fuck him.
	
	                     MEG
	          Don't.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Fuck her too.
	
	Meg looks at her, not sure how to confront the open defiance.
	
	                     MEG
	          I agree.  But don't.
	
	Sarah stares at her for a moment, then goes back to eating.
	
	Meg picks up the bottle of wine.
	
	Sarah's eyes flick over and watch as wine GLUGS into her
	mother's glass.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Sarah's bedroom is full of unpacked boxes, but her twin bed
	has been set up and Sarah is in it, hair wet, pajamas on.
	She reads from a book ("Tom Swift and His Repelatron Skyway")
	while Meg, drowsy, lies next to her, listening.
	
	                     SARAH
	          "Tom's throat felt so dry and tight
	          that it was a moment before he could
	          make any sound come out.  "Dad!" He
	          croaked.  "I'm - inside - the -
	          machine!" "Great Scott!"  The elder
	          scientist gasped.  He dashed across
	          the laboratory and switched off the
	          repelatron's motor.  "What happened,
	          son?" "The Durafoam hardened, Dad.
	          Get a solvent, quick -- you know the
	          formula!"
	
	INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the master bathroom, Meg soaks in a bath.  She is
	exhausted.  She reaches for her wine glass, finishes the last
	of it.
	
	She stretches for the bottle, which is on the floor next to
	her.  She refills the glass.  Again.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg, dressed in an old Knicks T-shirt and boxer shorts,
	stands next to the alarm panel in the master bedroom, reading
	from an instruction manual.  She's frustrated.  She mutters,
	slurring, a bit drunk.
	
	                     MEG
	          Bypass non-ready zones... shunt,
	          enter, zone number...
	
	She tries it, pushing a few buttons, but the alarm panel
	BEEPS at her disapprovingly.  She's doing something wrong.
	
	She sighs, sits on the floor, gets serious about figuring out
	the instructions.
	
	                     MEG
	          Bypass non-ready zones... ah, shunt,
	          enter, shunt again, zone number...
	          wait...
	
	HER FINGERS
	
	dance over the alarm panel, some time later.  She seems to
	have figured it out, and a small light on the panel lights
	up.
	
	SYSTEM ARMED
	
	The very moment the red light goes on, we cut sharply to --
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	-- the darkened panic room, where the dozen small video
	screens all suddenly wink to life, showing a dozen views of
	the house.  Whatever she pushed turned these on too, probably
	not what she meant to do, but at least she got the alarm on
	for the night.
	
	The door that leads from the panic room to the master bedroom
	hangs open.  In the middle of the floor in here, somebody has
	made a small tent of blankets and couch cushions.  Sarah must
	have been playing here before bed.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg puts sheets on her bed in the master bedroom.
	
	She fills a glass of water, puts it on a box she's using for
	a night table.
	
	She plugs in a battery charger for her cell phone, places the
	phone in the cradle.  It BEEPS.  "Charging."
	
	She sets the digital clock, puts it next to the glass of
	water.  It's 12:26.
	
	She gets in bed, her side, the left side.
	
	She lies in the dark, half an acre of empty bed across from
	her.
	
	We drift off her, see the clock again.  The time changes, the
	number one dissolves away, changing the time to --
	
	                                             DISSOLVE TO:
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	-- 2:26.  Meg is in a hard, boozy sleep.  We drift out the
	door of the master bedroom, into the third floor hallway, and
	down the open stairwell.  We glide through the entry floor,
	still gently falling through the stairwell's airway, dropping
	even further, all the way down to the kitchen floor, the
	ground floor.
	
	We drift across the darkened kitchen, serpentine through the
	canyon of moving boxes, approach the window that looks out on
	the street.
	
	We move right up against the window, peer through the glass
	just as --
	
	-- a van pulls up across the street and stops.  Can't see
	through its windows.  No movement for a moment, then the
	driver's door opens and a MAN climbs out.  He wears dark
	clothes.
	
	The Man closes the door, looks both ways, and starts across
	the street towards us.  He's carrying a bag of some kind.
	
	He goes to the door, and we drift down toward the doorknob.
	We hear a key slide into the door, rattle.
	
	But the lock doesn't turn.  The key slides out, back in
	again, jiggles.  Still won't open the door.
	
	The Man steps away from the door, goes to the kitchen window,
	which is heavily barred, and peers inside, right at us.
	Can't see anything, it's darker in here than it is out there.
	
	He turns, looks both ways on the street again, then steps up,
	onto the window ledge.  Now we can only see his legs, can't
	tell what he's doing.  He's reaching up, stretching for
	something.  It drops into view with a metallic SCRAPE.
	
	The fire escape.
	
	The Man climbs, his feet disappearing from our field of
	vision.
	
	We turn around, facing the other way in the kitchen.  We
	start back the way we came, through the canyon of boxes in
	the kitchen, toward the stairwell.
	
	INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT
	
	Back in the stairwell, the exact reverse of the shot we saw
	earlier.  We're drifting up, off the kitchen floor, through
	the entry floor, and as we rise we notice something all the
	way up on the roof that we couldn't see before, when we were
	looking down.
	
	A skylight.  We continue to rise, drawn toward it.  We move
	up, through the master bedroom floor, creeping up alongside
	the stair banister, now reaching the top floor of the house,
	and just as we near the skylight --
	
	-- a figure appears, visible through it.  The Man in dark
	clothes, on the roof now.  He stops, peers down through the
	skylight, looking at us without seeing us again.
	
	He steps across the skylight.  This is not the way he intends
	to enter.  We drift again, following his soft footsteps on
	the roof, which we can hear faintly through the ceiling.
	
	Here in the hall, just outside Sarah's bedroom, a closet door
	is ajar.  We squeeze through the gap and into the closet.
	
	IN THE CLOSET,
	
	it's completely dark.  Can't see a thing.  But then a sliver
	of light appears, coming from above.  We look up.
	
	There is a ladder that's bolted to the wall in this closet,
	it leads up to a square panel in the ceiling.
	
	Roof access.  And that roof access panel is moving, ever so
	slightly, moonlight spilling in as it twists in its setting.
	A shiny silver something slides through the crack along the
	edges of the portal.
	
	It slithers along the edge of the hatchway, searching for
	something.  It finds a small round nub in the crack.  The
	silver something stops.  It HUMS with electricity for a
	moment, then there is a bright spark and a soft CRACK.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the master bedroom, a message appears on the alarm panel:
	
	ZONE 19 DISABLED
	
	INT.  CLOSET - NIGHT
	
	In the closet, the silver something withdraws and the roof
	access panel is removed.  A million stars are visible in the
	night sky above.  But we're inside.
	
	And in a moment, so is this intruder.  The Man peers down,
	through the open hatchway, then slips through the opening and
	climbs silently down the ladder.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In bed, Meg stirs.  An alcohol sleep is a restless one, and
	she's suffering.
	
	She sits up groggily, chugs a glass of water.  Lies down
	again.
	
	INT.  FOURTH FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	One floor up, the Man steps into the hallway and starts for
	the stairs, moving quickly and confidently.  Knows where he's
	going, knows what he wants.  He starts down the stairs,
	happens to glance to the side as he does so.
	
	He freezes.  He's looking in the open doorway of the top
	floor bathroom, staring hard at something that clearly
	disturbs him.
	
	A nightlight.  Plugged into an outlet in the baseboard in the
	bathroom.  (For the record, it's the Power Puff Girls.)  The
	Man climbs the stairs again, concerned, goes to the door of
	the bathroom.  He looks from the nightlight to the
	countertop.
	
	There's a moving box on the countertop.  His eyes widen.
	This is news to him, bad news.
	
	He takes a step back and a breath.  He turns, looks to the
	end of the hall.  His eyes now adjusted to the darkness, he
	notices something he didn't see before, something coming from
	under the door to the fourth floor bedroom.
	
	Light.  From inside.  From another nightlight.
	
	INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the top floor bedroom, a nightlight burns in another
	outlet.  Nearby, Sarah is asleep in bed, the covers kicked
	off.
	
	The door to Sarah's bedroom glides open, terribly slowly.
	The Man stands in the doorway, staring, aghast, at the
	mountain of moving boxes piled in the room.  His gaze falls
	on Sarah in the bed.
	
	The Man just stares, beside himself.  His lips mouth a word,
	soundlessly.  Doesn't take a lip reader to guess it.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the master bedroom, Meg flops over in bed, facing away
	from the doorway, really having a rough go of it.  She slept
	too hard before, now she's awake, her head is killing her,
	she's really paying the price of four glasses of wine.
	
	She lies still, on her side, facing us.
	
	Behind her, the bedroom door moves, silently.
	
	Opening.
	
	The Man stands there, one finger still on the door he's just
	pushed open.  He stares at the sleeping form of Meg on the
	bed, whose back is to him.  He has no idea she's awake.
	
	Meg lies in bed, eyes wide open, no idea a Man is standing in
	the doorway to her bedroom.
	
	Noiselessly, the Man moves away, down the hall.  The moment
	his head disappears down the stairwell --
	
	-- Meg flops over again, facing the doorway.  She closes her
	eyes, gives sleep another try.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	The Man walks across the kitchen, shaking his head in
	exasperation at the packing boxes all around him.  He goes to
	the front window, peers outside.  He reaches for a light
	switch on his right.
	
	Through the window, we can see the stoop light go on.  Then
	off, then on and off again.
	
	Still through the window, we see the side panel door of the
	van slide open.
	
	TWO MORE MEN climb out.  They are also dressed in dark
	clothes.  They also carry satchels.
	
	They walks calmly across the street, grow large in the window
	as they approach us.  The first intruder (who has a name,
	it's BURNHAM) steps over to the kitchen door, runs his
	silvery strip through the gap.  Another HUM and spark.
	
	AN ALARM PANEL
	
	flashes again.
	
	ZONE 1 DISABLED
	
	IN THE KITCHEN,
	
	Burnham opens the kitchen door, letting the two other guys
	slip inside.  RAOUL is a hulking figure whose back seems to
	rise up over the top of his slouching head; when he walks it
	looks like gravity does all the work, just pulling him
	forward.  JUNIOR is much smaller, very high-strung, dresses
	like a homey, very street, but can't hide the fact that the
	street is Park Avenue.
	
	They all freeze, staring at the moving boxes.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Fuck.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I know.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          What?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          A woman and a little girl, both
	          asleep upstairs.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Fuck!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Keep your voice down.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          They're not supposed to be here!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          This was your department, Junior.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          They're not supposed to be here!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          That's why the key didn't work, they
	          changed the locks.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Fourteen day escrow, man, that's
	          almost three weeks!  They shouldn't
	          be here for another week!  They
	          don't own this house yet!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	               (pause)
	          Exactly how is fourteen days almost
	          three weeks?
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Fourteen business days.  Escrow is
	          always business days.
	
	Burnham sighs.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          I mean, right?  Isn't it?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          You're an idiot.
	
	Raoul steps forward, shoves Burnham with both hands in the
	chest.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Watch your mouth.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          It's okay, Raoul.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	               (to Junior)
	          Who is this guy?
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Raoul is cool.  That's all you need
	          to know.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          This is insane.  I'm outta here.
	
	He starts for the door.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Wait a minute, wait a minute.  We
	          can still handle this.
	               (to Raoul)
	          Can we still handle this?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          It's just the woman and the kid?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Unless Daddy comes back later.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Daddy's not coming back, she's in
	          the middle of a divorce, it's just
	          the two of them.  We're okay, here.
	               (to Raoul)
	          We can do this, right?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You're fuckin' A we can do this.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Not with me.  Not with people.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Forty-five minutes.  That's all you
	          said you need.  That's like nothing.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          She'll call the cops, they'll be
	          here before I get unpacked.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          So we keep an eye on her.  Raoul can
	          totally administrate that part.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          No problem.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I don't want Raoul to administrate
	          that part.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          They won't get hurt.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          What about us?  What if she has a
	          gun?
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Raoul, what in God's name do we do
	          if she has a gun?
	
	Raoul pulls up his sweatshirt, revealing a .38 tucked into
	his belt.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Asshole.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and
	          you insult him?  Hey, who's the
	          idiot?  Huh?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Where did you get this clown?
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          I met him at the tables, same as
	          you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we
	          have a little muscle right about
	          now.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          What tables?  I've never seen him
	          before.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Different tables.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	               (to Raoul)
	          The fuck did you bring a gun for?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You're welcome.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Peace out.
	
	He moves for the door.  Junior, trying desperately to hold
	this together, gets there first, blocks the door with his
	back.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          We can't do it without you, Burnham.
	
	Junior starts at Burnham.  Raoul stares at Burnham.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          It's still a good plan.  It's
	          just... got a twist.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Yeah.  Kidnapping.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't
	          kidnap somebody in their own house.
	          It's just breaking and entering,
	          unless we take 'em someplace.  Or
	          something like that, I'm pretty
	          sure.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Pure idiot.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          I am.  I'm an idiot's son.  An
	          idiot's grandson.  I'm third-
	          generation idiot.  But for once in
	          my life I had a good idea, and I'm
	          not giving up so easy.  You are?
	          Are you actually telling me that for
	          the first time in your life you're
	          gonna throw your cards on the table
	          and go home early?  I can't believe
	          my eyes.
	               (Burnham hesitates)
	          Fourteen million dollars upstairs,
	          Burnham.  You'll be out of the hole.
	          Baby, you'll be so far out of the
	          hole you could draw bricks every
	          night for the next twenty years and
	          still shit green.
	               (Burnham sways)
	          Come on, Buddy.  One more hand.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg sits up in bed.  She's bleary, her head feels like
	someone rested a manhole cover on it.  She gets up, in the
	dark, and staggers off toward the bathroom door, feeling her
	way with her arms, her eyes not adjusted to the dark.
	
	She steps through the door.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	She walks into the bathroom and feels around for a light
	switch, but can't find it.  She blinks, squints, tries to get
	her bearings.  The only light is a harsh white glow that
	comes from along one wall, from a bank of tiny video
	monitors.
	
	She finds the light switch, flicks it on, it nearly blinds
	her.  She's not in the bathroom.  She's wandered into the
	panic room by mistake.
	
	She turns around, walks out, leaving the lights on behind
	her.
	
	We linger for a look at the video screens.  If only she'd
	done the same, she'd see what we see.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	we see the three men, still in the kitchen, huddled in a
	group, silently debating what to do.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Using the light that spills from the open door to the panic
	room, Meg comes back into the master bedroom and finds the
	proper door to the bathroom.
	
	INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg SNAPS the cap off a jug of Advil and dumps three into her
	palm.  She pops them in her mouth, searches for a glass for
	water, finds none, bends to the spout for a gulp to wash them
	down.
	
	She turns to the toilet.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	On the monitor, we see the three men leave the kitchen and
	start up the stairs.
	
	INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg stands, flushes the toilet.
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	One floor down, Burnham, Raoul, and Junior freeze, just
	coming up the stairs from the kitchen.  They look up, hearing
	the water rushing through the pipes in the ceiling directly
	above them.
	
	They stare at the ceiling, following with their eyes as a
	pair of feet pad across the CREAKY floor.  Finally, they hear
	a SQUEAK of bedsprings as Meg climbs back into bed.
	
	They hold a moment longer, a silence grows.  Raoul reaches
	into his jacket pocket and pulls out a ski mask.  He pulls it
	over his head.  They look at him.
	
	                     RAOUL
	               (whispers)
	          No face.
	
	Burnham rolls his eyes.  Doesn't know this guy much, but
	hates him so far.  They start across the foyer toward the
	stairs.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg rolls over, to go back to sleep.  She sees she's left the
	lights on in the panic room.  She TSKS, gets out of bed, and
	walks across the floor toward it.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg steps into the panic room, raises her hand to the light
	switch --
	
	-- and stops, her hand frozen in mid-air.  She cocks her
	head, looking at something she can't understand.
	
	She blinks.  Takes a step, further into the room.  She stares
	at the video monitors -- at the three men in dark clothes,
	stealing silently across the foyer.
	
	This can't be.  These are just pictures, they have no
	relation to reality.  She drops to her knees, her face inches
	from the screens, and reaches out to touch them, as if trying
	to make sure they're really there.
	
	INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT
	
	They reach the base of the stairs, Junior in the lead.  As he
	reaches a bend at the base of the stairs, he places one foot
	short on an angled step and it slips off.  He trips, falls
	forward.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Watching the video monitors, Meg stares in horror as the
	image of Junior slipping is verified by the SLAP of his hands
	on the stairs as he catches himself, audible through the open
	door to the panic room.
	
	She GASPS.  It is real.
	
	INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT
	
	In the living room, Burnham's eyes are wide as saucers,
	staring at Junior as he turns and pulls himself to his feet.
	
	Junior points at Raoul, speaks in an urgent whisper.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Top floor, get the little girl and
	          keep her there.  I'll bring the
	          woman up.  Gimme.
	
	He holds out his hand for the gun and Raoul gives it to him.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	               (points to Burnham)
	          Stay here.  Nobody gets past you.
	
	He heads for the stairs.  Raoul follows close behind him.
	Burnham stays, reluctant -- what the fuck has he gotten
	himself into?
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg moves.  Leaps to her feet and dashes out of the room.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg races across her bedroom, flies out the door, and bolts
	up the carpeted stairs, headed for the top floor.
	
	INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg races into Sarah's room, drops onto the bed, and grabs
	Sarah by the shoulders, trying to rouse her.
	
	                     MEG
	          Wake up... wake up...
	
	But she's in a profound child's sleep and won't wake up.
	
	INT.  THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	One floor down, Junior and Raoul reach the third floor
	landing.  Still moving stealthily, Junior heads down the hall
	for the master bedroom, where he thinks Meg is sleeping.
	Raoul heads for the stairs that lead to the top floor.
	
	INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg is desperate, still can't wake Sarah.
	
	                     MEG
	          Wake up...come on, come on...
	
	She sees a plastic cup on her night table/box, half filled
	with water.  She snatches it and tosses the water in her
	face.
	
	Now she's awake.  And pissed off.  She SPUTTERS, SHOUTS.
	
	                     SARAH
	          WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR?!
	
	INT.  THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	Raoul, at the base of the stairs that lead to the top floor,
	hears the kid shouting.  He starts up the stairs, quickly.
	
	INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	On the top floor, Meg is already dragging Sarah out of the
	room and into the hallway.
	
	INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	Meg and Sarah come out of Sarah's bedroom just as Raoul
	reaches the top of the stairs at the other end.  They're cut
	off.
	
	Meg freezes, staring at the hulking ski-masked figure at the
	end of the hallway.  She thinks, no idea what to do for a
	second.  She looks frantically to her right -- the bathroom,
	dead end.
	
	She looks to her left.
	
	The elevator.
	
	She yanks open the elevator door, throws aside the gate, and
	races inside with Sarah.
	
	Raoul takes off down the hall, lunging for the elevator.
	
	INT.  ELEVATOR - NIGHT
	
	Meg SLAMS the gate shut and PUNCHES the button for the first
	floor.  The elevator GROANS to life and starts down --
	slowly.
	
	Sarah looks up at her, terrified.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What's going on?!
	
	                     MEG
	          People.  In the house.
	
	As the elevator descends, they see Raoul, through the window
	in the door, as he drops to his knees, to get a good look at
	them.
	
	INT.  TOP FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	Raoul turns from the elevator, SHOUTS to the open stairwell.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          IN THE ELEVATOR!  BOTH OF 'EM HEADED
	          TOWARD YOU!
	
	INT.  THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	Junior turns from the open doorway of the master bedroom and
	races back down the hall, toward the elevator.  He reaches
	the door, peers through the window.
	
	He sees the bare feet of Meg and Sarah, dropping toward him.
	He grabs the door handle, pulls as hard as he can, but it
	stays locked, with the elevator moving beyond.
	
	He bangs on the button, hoping the elevator will stop.  As
	Meg and Sarah drop fully into view, he stands there, eye to
	moving eye with her for a moment.  But the elevator doesn't
	stop, it keeps going down.
	
	INT.  ELEVATOR - NIGHT
	
	Meg stands frozen, terrified, staring at Junior as they move
	past him.
	
	Junior has another go at the door, pulling as hard as he can,
	actually bending the door, but the elevator is still moving,
	the catch holds fast and the door won't open.
	
	As they pass, his face suddenly disappears, he takes off.
	
	INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT
	
	Junior flies down the stairs, to cut them off at the first
	floor.
	
	INT.  ELEVATOR - NIGHT
	
	                     MEG
	          He's going down.
	
	                     SARAH
	          That room!
	
	                     MEG
	          What?!
	
	                     SARAH
	          PANIC ROOM!
	
	Meg thinks, then punches the button for three, to go back up.
	
	But the elevator continues down.  She jabs at it, futilely.
	
	                     SARAH
	          No.  you gotta...
	
	She reaches past her, pushes the STOP button.  The elevator
	jerks to a halt.  Then Sarah pushes three.  Now the elevator
	starts to rise.
	
	Meg looks at her, impressed.  Love that kid.
	
	INT.  ENTRY FLOOR - NIGHT
	
	In the foyer, Junior freezes, hearing the elevator stop and
	start again.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          SHE'S COMING BACK UP TOWARD YOU!!
	
	He takes off up the stairs again.  Burnham can't take it
	anymore, he takes off after Junior, following him upstairs.
	
	INT.  FOURTH FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	Raoul, still on the top floor, heads for the stairs, fast.
	
	INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT
	
	Junior races back up the stairs.  They have her caught in the
	middle.
	
	INT.  THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	The door to the elevator BANGS open on three, the gate
	RATTLES aside, and Meg and Sarah leap out.  They take off
	down the hall, toward the doorway to the master bedroom.
	
	Raoul flies down the stairs, not twenty feet behind them.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg and Sarah run through the master bedroom.  As she passes
	the night table, Sarah swings an open hand to grab her cell
	phone from its cradle.  But in her haste she starts to pull
	it out at an angle and the prongs at the bottom stick in the
	charger.  The phone slips from her fingers, bounces off the
	corner of the table, caroms off her foot, and skitters under
	the bed.
	
	Sarah turns, looks to the head of the stairs just as Junior
	turns the corner and Raoul thunders down the steps from four.
	
	She abandons the phone, grabs Sarah, and they lunge through
	the open doorway to the panic room.
	
	Junior and Raoul burst through the doorway to the bedroom,
	just a few steps away.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg and Sarah trip over each other coming through the
	doorway, they tumble to the floor of the panic room, the door
	wide open behind them.  Meg spins around, hurls herself at
	the red button on the wall --
	
	-- Junior leaps, sailing through the air toward them --
	
	-- Meg SLAMS her open palm on the red button, the massive
	coiled spring that holds the metal door open is released, the
	steel barrier leaps forward out of the wall --
	
	-- and WHANGS shut in a split-second.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Junior SLAMS into the closing metal door, banging his
	shoulder into it, and slithers to the ground, too late.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg rolls over and pulls Sarah into her arms, both of them
	breathing hard, asking each other if they're okay, scared out
	of their minds.
	
	But safe.
	
	She spots the telephone, the one with the special buried
	phone line.  She lunges for it, snatches it from its cradle,
	listens for a dial tone.
	
	Nothing there either.
	
	                     MEG
	          Damn it!
	
	                     SARAH
	          It doesn't work?!
	
	                     MEG
	          Different phone line, I never hooked
	          it up!
	
	She hurls it down, looks back at Sarah.  She seems a bit
	pale, scared.  She goes to her, holds her, reassures her.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Junior is slumped at the base of the door, livid, in pain,
	pounding on it with his fists, screaming "NO!" over and over
	again, crazy with rage.
	
	Raoul stands in the middle of the room, chest heaving, hands
	on his knees.
	
	Burnham finally walks into the room and stops in the doorway,
	looks from Raoul to Junior to the door to the panic room,
	figures out the situation.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Tell me... tell me they're not in
	          there...
	
	We rise up, above them, above the room, looking down on them,
	the rats-in-a-maze shot.
	
	We rise up further still, above where the ceiling ought to
	be, to look down on this room and the one beside it, the room
	behind the four inches of reinforced steel, the panic room in
	which Meg and Sarah kneel in the middle of the floor, holding
	each other tight.
	
	Standoff.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Very close on the metal door, from inside the panic room.  An
	ear moves slowly into frame, presses against the cold steel.
	Listens.
	
	Meg pulls away from the door, shaking her head.
	
	                     MEG
	          Can't hear a thing.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What do they want?
	
	                     MEG
	          I don't know.  Rob us.  I don't
	          know.
	
	She sits back against a wall, looks around, at the tiny room.
	She's trying not to show how freaked out she is.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What do we do?
	
	                     MEG
	          Wait.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What if they get in here?
	
	                     MEG
	          They can't.  They can't get in here.
	          No.  They can't.
	
	                     SARAH
	          I heard you.
	
	                     MEG
	          Feel okay?
	
	                     SARAH
	          Yeah.
	
	                     MEG
	          Shaky?
	
	                     SARAH
	          Nope.
	
	                     MEG
	          Chills?
	
	                     SARAH
	          Huh uh.
	
	She checks her wristwatch, for some reason.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Don't worry about me.
	
	The implications being, worry about yourself.
	
	Sarah crawls over to the bank of video monitors, studies
	them.  Meg crawls over to join her.  They scan the screens.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	there are a dozen different views of the house.  Front stoop.
	Kitchen.  Dining room.  Entry floor.  Living room.  Master
	bedroom.  Den.  Top floor bedrooms, both of them.  Top two
	floor hallways.  Even one with a shot of the inside of the
	elevator.
	
	The three intruders are gathered in the living room, standing
	in a tight circle, having a hell of an argument.  Lots of
	gesturing, fingers jabbing in chests, but we can't hear a
	word.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg furrows her brow, noticing something interesting to the
	right of the video monitors.  She slides over, studies a
	panel there with sixteen different buttons and a small
	grilled area.
	
	                     MEG
	          Hey...
	
	Sarah joins her, looks at the buttons.  Each one is labeled
	with a different room name -- den, kitchen, master bedroom,
	etc.  Up in the corner there is a button that says "ALL
	PAGE," down in the opposite corner there's a button marked
	"TALK."
	
	Meg looks at Sarah.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Go ahead.
	
	Meg is reluctant, frightened.  Sarah is encouraging, for the
	first time.
	
	                     SARAH
	          You can do it.
	
	Meg leans forward, clears her throat.
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham, Raoul, and Junior are standing in the half-darkened
	living room, in the middle of their argument, when a VOICE
	booms around them.
	
	                     MEG (O.S.)
	          Excuse me.
	
	They practically jump out of their shoes, looking around for
	the source of the voice.
	
	                     MEG (O.S.)
	          The police are on their way.
	
	Only Burnham has remained relatively calm.  After he gets
	over the initial shock, he walks toward the tiny camera
	that's hidden in an upper corner of the living room wall and
	stares up at it.  Raoul, who has taken off his ski mask, is
	careful to move out of the camera's range, and turn his back
	to it.
	
	                     MEG
	          I suggest you leave.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	Burnham looks up at the camera and shakes his head, wagging a
	finger from side to side.  He raises a hand, makes a gesture
	like a telephone, then wags his finger again.  The message is
	clear -- you don't have a phone.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg is puzzled.
	
	                     MEG
	          How'd he know that?
	
	She presses the talk button again.
	
	                     MEG
	               (into speaker)
	          Take what you want and get out.
	
	That sounded fairly tough.  She looks at the monitor again.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	the three of them have an urgent, whispered conference, then
	they all start patting their pockets for some reason, turning
	in circles, looking for something.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg and Sarah watch them, confused.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	Burnham holds up a finger to the camera -- wait a second --
	while Raoul and Junior rush off screen, looking for
	something.  Junior returns a moment later holding something
	and the three of them hunch over a box, working on something.
	
	After a moment, they break apart and Junior steps up to the
	camera holding a pad of paper.  He shows it to the camera.
	On the top page, in big block letters, they've written.
	
	WHAT WE WANT
	
	After a suitable pause for reading, he turns to the second
	page, where four more words are written.
	
	IS IN THAT ROOM.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah GASPS, Meg sits back.
	
	                     MEG
	          "What we want is in that room."
	
	                     SARAH
	          They're coming in here, aren't they?
	
	                     MEG
	          No, I told you, they can't.  It's
	          not a possibility.
	
	Angry, she sits forward and jabs the talk button.
	
	                     MEG
	               (into speaker)
	          What do you know about this room?
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	there is more frenzied writing, more arguing, and a first
	draft of a response torn up.  Finally, Junior steps forward
	with another sign:
	
	MORE THAN YOU.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg's confidence is ebbing, but she doesn't want to show it.
	She hits the talk button again.
	
	                     MEG
	               (into speaker)
	          We're not coming out.  We're not
	          letting you in.  Get out of my
	          house.
	               (clicks off)
	
	                     SARAH
	          Say fuck.
	
	                     MEG
	               (into speaker)
	          Fuck.
	
	                     SARAH
	          "Get the fuck out of my house."
	
	                     MEG
	               (into speaker)
	          Get the fuck out of my house!
	
	She clicks off again, looks to Sarah for approval, and gets
	it, sort of, in Sarah's half-smile.  But Sarah's eyes go back
	to the screen.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Answer.
	
	Meg follows Sarah's eyes back to the screen, where another
	message is being held up for them.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	the notepad says:
	
	WE WILL LET YOU GO.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg and Sarah speak at the same time.
	
	                     MEG
	          Oh, please.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Give me a break.
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the living room, her voice booms from the speaker.
	
	                     MEG (O.S.)
	          Conversation's over.
	
	With an audible CLICK, she signs off.  Burnham, Raoul, and
	Junior stand arrayed beneath the camera, staring up at it,
	dumbfounded.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Got her right where you want her,
	          Junior.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Shut up.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          When you said you'd let 'em go I
	          thought she'd come running right out
	          for sure.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Shut up and let me think.
	
	He opens a pack of cigarettes, takes out a joint and lights
	it.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I'm afraid to let you think, Junior.
	          Things get worse when you think.
	               (sniffs)
	          Oh, that's gonna help.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	               (holding in a hit)
	          Okay, fuckball, you think.  What are
	          we gonna do?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          What if she called the cops?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          She didn't.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          She said she did.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          She lied.  Cops woulda been here by
	          now if she called 'em.  Besides,
	          Junior cut the phones.
	
	Burnham goes to the window and stares outside.  He laughs,
	covers his face.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          What the fuck is funny about this?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          God.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          There is not one thing funny here.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Who else but God could think this
	          shit up?  I spend ten years building
	          those fucking rooms to keep people
	          out, now I gotta figure out how to
	          get in.  God, man, He just loves the
	          irony.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic
	          and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are
	          you gonna get us into that room?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in
	          the room.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          So what the fuck are we supposed to
	          do?!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Make her come out.  And when she
	          does, that's when we gotta be
	          careful.  She can't get out of this
	          house.  She can't even think she can
	          get out of this house.  We just keep
	          them here and keep them quiet for
	          forty-five minutes.  And I don't
	          want
	               (Raoul)
	          Joe Pesci here standing over them
	          with his fat sweaty finger on the
	          trigger.  That's a sure way for us
	          to end up with two dead bodies and
	          little puffs of smoke burning out of
	          our heads up in Greenhaven.  So
	          we're gonna seal the place up.  They
	          wanna hole up in here?  Fine, we'll
	          help 'em.  Make it impossible for
	          them to leave.  Once they come out
	          of that room.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          And why exactly would they want to
	          come out?
	
	At the window, Burnham notices something sitting just outside
	the French doors, on the balcony.  It's a large outdoor
	barbecue grill.  He thinks, takes a step closer.
	
	He sees a white five gallon tank of some kind underneath the
	grill.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Workin' on it.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the panic room, Meg is sitting cross-legged on the floor,
	leaning against a wall, but Sarah is in motion, sorting
	through shelves, opening drawers.  Every drawer has something
	in it, sealed under plastic.  She opens and closes, sorts and
	lifts finds the following:
	
	Waterproof matches and lighters.
	
	Flashlights.
	
	Unopened packages of batteries.
	
	Sealed water bags stamped "PURE FIVE YEARS FROM DATE."
	
	Tinned food.
	
	Flares.
	
	Pillows, fireproof blankets (we know because the bags are
	stamped FIREPROOF BLANKET).
	
	A complete tool kit.
	
	As Sarah explores, she discovers something in the far wall at
	the end of the room, down on the floor at eye level.
	
	It's a small round portal, about eight inches across, with a
	four-pronged cloverlike seal.  The portal is closed tight, as
	Sarah pokes and scrapes at it idly with a finger or two, it
	resists her attempts to crank it open.
	
	Meg notices.
	
	                     MEG
	          Hey.  Relax, okay?
	
	But Sarah keeps at it, feels along the edges of the portal,
	then all along the wall, looking for some kind of hidden
	switch that controls it.
	
	                     MEG
	          I mean it, lie down.  You get your
	          adrenaline up and you know what's
	          gonna happen.
	
	Sarah stops, looks at her mother, who is pale and wan,
	huddled in the corner.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Are you freaking out?
	
	                     MEG
	          Little bit.  Yeah.
	
	Sarah looks around the room.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Small space?
	
	                     MEG
	               (nods, fast)
	          Don't though.
	               (talk about it, that is)
	
	Sarah looks at her, thinks.  It's not an unfamiliar
	situation, her needing to comfort her mother.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Why did the chicken cross the road?
	
	                     MEG
	          What am I, a five year old?
	
	                     SARAH
	          Why did the chicken cross the road?
	
	                     MEG
	          I don't know, why?
	
	                     SARAH
	          To prove he wasn't chicken.
	
	Meg tries to push a smile across her face, but it's
	immediately dashes as she looks back at the video screens.
	Her eyes show alarm, staring at the kitchen.
	
	                     MEG
	          What the hell are they doing?
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	The contents of one of the satchels is dumped out over the
	kitchen counter, every kind of tool imaginable, many that are
	unfamiliar to us.  They sort through the pile, choosing
	things.
	
	INT.  KITCHEN FLOOR - REAR DOORS - NIGHT
	
	At the French doors that lead to the garden, Burnham has a
	cordless screwdriver and a pile of long screws in his hand.
	He reaches up, drills a screw through the door, into the
	corner of the door frame.  He does the same at the bottom of
	the door.
	
	He unlocks the doorknob, tries it.  The screws hold the door
	fast.  He moves on, to the next door.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the panic room, Meg stares at the video screens, eyes
	wide, terrified.  She watches them.  Can't take her eyes off
	them.
	
	                     MEG
	               (barely audible)
	          ... locking us in...
	
	INT.  LIBRARY - NIGHT
	
	In the library, in the front of the house, Raoul screws shut
	a window, driving the long screws into its frame.  He looks
	out at the street, at two CLUBGOERS walking home.
	
	He pulls the drape.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg's hands are over her mouth, she's trembling, shaking her
	head from side to side.  This can't be happening.
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	In the kitchen, Junior goes to the wall phone Meg used to
	call for pizza earlier.  He cuts the phone wire with a
	knife.
	
	He stands there, staring at the phone, wiping the sweat from
	his palms on his pants.  Not satisfied, he pulls the phone
	itself out of the wall, cuts the cord for the handset too.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg pushes herself back into the corner of the panic room,
	horrified.  Sweat has broken out on her forehead, her whole
	body seems to vibrate.  Sarah comes over, leans in front of
	her.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Mom?
	
	But Sarah's voice is hollow, seems far away.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Are you okay?
	
	Meg looks at her.  As she watches, Sarah floats away from
	her.  In fact, the entire room is floating away from her,
	elongating.
	
	And narrowing.  Meg looks to the sides, and the walls don't
	just seem like they're pushing in on her, they are pushing in
	on her.
	
	Meg opens her mouth, screams, but no sound comes out.
	
	Sarah stands up and bends over her, but now she's just a
	figure far away, all the way at the end of a long, impossibly
	narrow hall.
	
	                     SARAH
	               (barely heard)
	          MOM?!  MOM!!
	
	Meg crawls out, into the middle of that hallway, to get away
	from the wall, but they both continue moving in on her.
	
	                     MEG
	          Not here... not here... someplace
	          else... someplace else...
	
	Her eyes roll back into her head, we see just the whites, and
	she loses her balance, falling over onto her back.
	
	We fall with her, move in tight on her face, and the dark
	hallway carpet beneath it turns to green, all green, grassy
	green.  She sits up, looks around, and we realize she is in
	fact somewhere else, she's --
	
	EXT.  GREAT LAWN - DAY
	
	-- in the middle of the Great Lawn, in Central Park.  She
	stands, turns in a circle, she's completely alone on the
	great green grassy plain in the middle of a beautiful spring
	day, tall buildings sparkling in the distance.
	
	Meg stretches her arms out, smiles, but far off in the
	distance, she hears a voice calling to her, dimly:
	
	                     SARAH (O.S.)
	          Mom?!  Mom!!
	
	Meg ignores the voice, she's so happy to be out here, out in
	the open, in the beautiful wide open, she could stay here
	forever, she spins around, throws her head back, but there's
	that voice again, insistent:
	
	                     SARAH (O.S.)
	          Mom, please!!
	
	There is the sharp sound of a SLAP, and Meg's face abruptly
	jerks to the side.  She touches her cheek, confused, as a hot
	red handprint rises up on it.
	
	What the hell was that?
	
	BAM!
	
	Now the perfect spring day is shattered suddenly by a
	deafening CRUNCH.  The smile vanishes from Meg's face, she
	turns.  Where did that come from?
	
	BAM!  Another one, even louder.  Meg's whole body winces at
	the sound.
	
	BAM!  A third one, and on this one Meg falls to her knees,
	covering her ears, walls spring up around her, right there on
	the Great Lawn, we rush in on her, the walls close in, and
	she's right back --
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	-- in the panic room, where she always was, and that pounding
	is real, it's right outside the door, it's like somebody's
	trying to smash their way right through the wall.
	
	Sarah is right over Meg, holding her by the arms, and that
	handprint on Meg's face is real, Sarah must have slapped her
	to try to bring her out of it.
	
	                     SARAH
	          THEY'RE COMING IN!  THEY'RE COMING
	          IN!
	
	Meg looks to the wall, watches it seem to vibrate as another
	deafening BANG crunches into it from outside.
	
	BAM!  BAM!  BAM!  The sound is deafening.  Sarah throws both
	hands over her ears.  Meg looks around, still disoriented.
	
	                     SARAH
	          YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  YOU CAN'T FREAK
	          OUT LIKE THAT!  YOU HAVE TO STAY
	          HERE WITH ME!
	
	                     MEG
	          I am.  I'm here.
	
	                     SARAH
	          YOU HAVE TO!
	
	                     MEG
	          I'm here.  I'm here.
	
	They huddle there, terrified.  Meg blinks, wipes the sweat
	from her forehead, begins to come back around.  She turns her
	head, sneaks a look at the funny wristwatch Sarah wears,
	tries to look without her daughter knowing.  It's not an
	ordinary watch, it only has one number, a tall, flashing
	digital display:
	
	120
	
	Meg nods, as if reassuring herself.
	
	                     MEG
	          We're fine.  We're okay.
	
	She turns, looks at the video monitors to see what the hell
	they're doing out there.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	BAM!
	
	In the master bedroom, a claw hammer CRUNCHES into the
	sheetrock on the outer wall of the panic room.
	
	The intruders are in the master bedroom now, and Burnham is
	like a man possessed, tearing at the sheetrock with the sharp
	end of the tool while Junior shines a flashlight into the
	hole.
	
	As the sheetrock tears away, we see the skeleton of the wall
	behind it.  There's a latticework of two by four studs, and
	beyond those the dull shine of the wall's metal core.
	
	But that's not what he's after.  He continues tearing,
	reveals an air duct running through the wall, feeding into
	the panic room through a welded hole in the steel.  Burnham
	tears away with the hammer, exposing a short section of the
	duct.
	
	CLANG!  The claw hammer drops into an opened toolbox.
	Burnham drops to his knees, rips open another tool case.
	This one has a sophisticated looking power drill in it, along
	with a couple dozen specialized bits.  He selects one, twists
	it into the drill.
	
	At the wall, Burnham puts drill to metal and hits the switch.
	A horrendous METAL SCREECH fills the air and the drill bit
	tears into the duct, opening up a jagged hole about the size
	of a quarter.
	
	Raoul hurries through the doorway of the bedroom, carrying a
	coiled garden hose.  Burnham snaps his fingers for it, Raoul
	tosses it to him, holding one end, and the hose uncoils in
	the air as it snakes across the room.
	
	Burnham shoves the end of the garden hose into the hole he's
	just drilled in the air duct.
	
	RIP!  He tears off a length of duct tape and seals the
	connection, makes it airtight.
	
	SLIT!  Using a large hunting knife, Raoul hacks a ten foot
	section of the garden hose off the coil.
	He stretches it out, across the room, to the white five
	gallon tank we saw before, which is now sitting on the floor
	up here.  We move in close as Burnham snugs the cut end of
	the garden hose over a spigot at the top of the tank.  Red
	block letters are easy to read on the side of the tank.
	
	PROPANE
	CAUTION - FLAMMABLE
	
	Along with a number of other dire warnings.
	
	Burnham raises his hand to the knob, hesitates, doesn't
	really want to do this, but doesn't stop himself either.
	
	He spins it open.  Halfway.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Open it.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I did.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          He said open it.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Just sending a message.  She'll get
	          the point.
	
	Gas HISSES through the spigot and into the hose.  We follow
	along the length of the hose, across the floor of the room,
	through the hole in the sheetrock, into the hole that's been
	drilled in the air duct --
	
	INSIDE THE WALL
	
	-- through the wall itself, where we see the horizontal lines
	of an air vent up ahead.  We squeeze between two of the
	horizontal lines --
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	-- and come out in the panic room.  Three red streamers, tied
	to the air vent, flap to life as the gas HISSES into the
	panic room.
	
	Directly underneath the vent, Meg is hunched up against the
	wall, her arm around Sarah.
	
	She sniffs.
	
	Again.
	
	Sarah sniffs.
	
	They look at each other.
	
	She looks up.  Sees the streamers floating above her.
	
	She leaps to her feet, steps up onto a shelf, and stretches
	her nose toward the streamers.  Just as she does --
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Near the tank, Raoul shoves Burnham out of the way.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          We ain't playin', here.
	
	He cranks the valve handle of the grill open all the way.
	The gas pours into the hose with an audible WHOOSH.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg, at the vent, falls back, two lungfuls of propane, and
	drops to her knees on the floor.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What, what, what is it?!
	
	                     MEG
	          On the floor!  Get on the floor!
	
	Now Sarah coughs.  The gas is pouring into the room.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Raoul is standing guard over the tank, to make sure no one
	messes with the valve.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Look, don't be stupid...
	
	Junior has his head pressed against the door to the panic
	room, trying to hear any sounds from within.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Be quiet.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          We're trying to scare them, not kill
	          them!
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          They're coughing.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          They're gonna die in there!
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Nobody is gonna die, man, will you
	          please have the balls to follow
	          through with a good idea?  Think
	          about it, what would you do if you
	          were them, stay in there and choke
	          to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're
	          just getting them to come out for
	          forty-five minutes, forty-five
	          fucking minutes!  The worst that's
	          gonna happen is they pass out, we
	          drag 'em out here into the fresh
	          air, and they'll be fine.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are
	          we supposed to get into the room if
	          they pass out?
	
	Pause.  Junior turns to Raoul.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Cut it back a little bit.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          No fucking way.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          He's right, we can't get into the
	          room if they're dead!
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg and Sarah are down on the floor, rags covering their
	mouths, trying like crazy to filter the air, but it's not
	working.  Sarah is crawling around the base of the wall, near
	to where she was before, clawing at the strange portal thing
	again.
	
	Finally, she finds a small metal handle, folded back into the
	clover-leaf seal on the portal.  She unfolds it, twists it.
	
	The portal cranks open, revealing it to be at the end of a
	tube, about a foot long, an emergency ventilation source
	directly through to the exterior of the house.  She bends
	down and looks through it.  It's covered by a metal mesh at
	the opposite end, but she can see and smell the outside
	through it.
	
	She sits up, gestures to her mother to bend down next to her.
	She does, and they both jam their mouths up near the end of
	the tube, gulping fresh air greedily.
	
	Meg looks at Sarah, good job, and they both drop to the floor
	at the portal and suck air.  It's temporary, but it works.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the master bedroom, the debate has turned physical.
	Burnham lunges across the room at Raoul, to get his hands on
	the valve, to turn off the gas.  But Raoul catches him and
	hurls him aside.
	
	Burnham SLAMS into the wall, bounces off and SCREAMS at
	Raoul, who SCREAMS right back.  Junior leaps into the middle,
	trying to break it up, to get them to shut up, keep their
	voices down.
	
	It's bedlam.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the panic room, Meg knows this can't go on forever.  She
	turns away from the portal, looks up at the vent, where the
	streamers still stream.
	
	She looks to the other side of the room, to where Sarah found
	the waterproof matches and lighters.
	
	She thinks.  Takes a deep lungful of fresh air from the tube
	and crawls over to the lighters.  She selects one, snatches
	up a screwdriver.
	
	Sarah looks at her, has a vague idea of what she's thinking,
	but can't believe it.  She shakes her head vehemently.
	
	In response, Meg picks up two or three of the fireproof
	blankets and piles them over Sarah, right up to her
	disbelieving eyes.  She bends down, takes another gulp of
	air.  but she's getting woozy.  This can't go on much longer.
	
	She staggers across the room, hoists herself back up onto the
	shelf she stood on before, and gets right up next to the
	vent.  Holding her breath to avoid breathing the toxic gas,
	she unscrews the vent cover.
	
	The duct is wide enough to put your arm in.  She reaches in,
	past a bundle of multicolored wires that run down through the
	wall.  She reaches all the way in, lighter in hand.
	
	INSIDE THE DUCT,
	
	we see her hand crawl in, lighter clenched between her
	fingers.  She raises a thumb to the flint wheel, cranks it
	once.
	
	Too slow.  Not even a spark.
	
	Her hand shakes.  She tries again.  Still no spark.  But with
	the effort and the angle, when she thumbs the lighter it
	makes her hand twitch, banging up against the sides of the
	duct with a hollow BOOM.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham turns abruptly.
	
	He turns around.  They all freeze, listening.  He hears it
	again.  The hollow BOOM, coming from inside the wall.  Now a
	third time.
	
	He walks forward, slowly, toward the wall.
	
	BOOM.
	
	He moves closer, gets right up next to the wall.  He leans
	into the wall, putting his ear right up next to the air duct.
	This close, he hears the sound in more detail, realizes it's
	two sounds.
	
	SCRATCH.  BOOM.
	
	He arches an eyebrow.
	
	INSIDE THE DUCT,
	
	Meg's hand is trembling, tiring.  She tries again, thumbs the
	flint wheel.  It SCRATCHES as it rolls, her hand twitches,
	BOOMS against the side of the duct.
	
	Still, the gas HISSES through.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg's face is turning color, she's running out of air.  Her
	feet tremble on the shelf, she's about to lose her footing.
	
	INSIDE THE DUCT,
	
	she tries again.  SCRATCH.  BOOM.
	
	IN THE BEDROOM,
	
	Burnham's eyes suddenly pop wide as he identifies the sound.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Oh.
	
	He tears himself away from the wall --
	
	INSIDE THE DUCT,
	
	-- Meg's thumb tenses for one good hard turn --
	
	IN THE BEDROOM,
	
	-- Burnham leaps through the air, hurling himself toward the
	propane tank --
	
	INSIDE THE DUCT,
	
	-- Meg cranks the wheel, a spark sparks, a flame flames, and
	a hot blue cloud shoots out in two directions, one toward the
	panic room, the other toward the bedroom.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg jumps off the shelf, throwing herself as far away from
	the vent as she can, her arm engulfed by licking blue flame.
	She drops to the floor of the room, covering her daughter's
	body just as the entire ceiling of the panic room turns into
	a lake of fire with a deafening WHOOMP.  The fluorescent
	light tubes EXPLODE, showering glass everywhere.
	
	IN THE BEDROOM,
	
	the blue flame shoots out of the wall, into the hose, through
	the hose, backing up toward the tank.
	
	Burnham CRUNCHES to the floor next to the tank, knocking the
	other end of the hose away from the spigot just as the blue
	flame erupts from the end of the hose.
	
	The flame engulfs his entire body, his hair starts on fire,
	his chest, his arms.  Raoul lunges forward, Junior tears the
	blankets from the bed and throws them over him, Burnham HOWLS
	and rolls on the floor in pain.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	the blue cloud on the ceiling suddenly evaporates with
	another angry WHOOMP, leaving a few little pockets of flame
	that Meg extinguishes by swatting with a blanket.  Only one
	of the fluorescent lights is left intact; it casts a
	flickering, uneven light on the room.
	
	She stands in the middle of the still-smoky panic room,
	breathing hard.  She shouts, SCREAMS incomprehensibly, making
	no sense whatsoever.
	
	She stops, noticing the look Sarah is giving her.  Wide-eyed
	admiring, frightened, you are an insane woman.
	
	Meg looks to herself.  Her arm is signed, the hair burned
	off.  The sleeve of her T-shirt is burned back to the
	shoulder.  Her face is sooty, blackened.
	
	Meg GRUNTS, half frightened by herself.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Out in the bedroom, it's worse for Burnham, who has lost most
	of his hair and shirt.  But his skin isn't badly burned,
	which is something, I guess.
	
	Still, he's in a rage.  He POUNDS the metal door of the panic
	room.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I'M COMING IN THERE, BITCH, I AM
	          COMING IN THERE!  I AM COMING IN
	          THERE!
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg whirls, goes to the door herself, SCREAMS right back.  We
	can hardly make out a word she's saying, but it sounds
	threatening.
	
	Suddenly, she stops, hearing something else.  Outside the
	door, Burnham continues to rant, but there's a second sound,
	a sound coming from the long wall of the panic room, the wall
	that's shared with the brownstone next door.
	
	It's a faint -- very faint -- POUNDING sound, along with a
	high pitched, complaining voice, so faint it can hardly be
	heard.  Sarah hears it too.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Neighbor!
	
	Meg and Sarah leap as one, facing the common wall, SHOUTING
	at the tops of their lungs -- get help, call the police,
	please, call the police, that sort of thing.
	
	They shout and shout, but the soft pounding continues, and if
	their voices are as soft on the other side as the COMPLAINING
	VOICE is on this side, they have no hope.
	
	Their voices crack and they begin to cough, too irritated by
	the gas to shout for very long.  Long after they stop, the
	soft POUNDING from next door continues.
	
	Their pleas are not heard.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	The Intruders have stopped their racket too, and are
	listening carefully at the common wall.  Eventually, the soft
	POUNDING stops, the complaining voice complains no more.
	
	Burnham stands there, in pain.  Things are falling apart.
	Raoul stands in the doorway, silhouetted by the hallway
	light.  He draws himself up to his full, bulky height.  He's
	big.
	
	                     RAOUL
	               (to Junior)
	          We're gonna talk.  Downstairs.
	
	Junior nods and starts out.  Raoul lets him pass, but when
	Burnham tries to follow him, Raoul puts a big hand on his
	chest stopping him.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You stay.  Make sure she don't come
	          out.
	
	Burnham swallows.  But stays.
	
	Raoul turns, follows Junior downstairs.  As he descends, he
	looks up, making eye contact with Burnham.  And holding it.
	Something on his mind, that's for sure.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	THUNK.  Meg's head falls back against a wall; she sags to the
	floor, legs folded in front of her, completely drained.
	
	But Sarah's not drained, Sarah's full of nervous ingenuity,
	rustling around through the stuff in the panic room, an idea
	forming in her head.  She finds a powerful-looking flashlight
	and loads it up with batteries.  She tries it, flashing
	around the room.
	
	Halogen bulb, very powerful, hurts her mother's eyes as she
	flashes it past.  Meg watches her.  What's she up to?
	
	Sarah lays on the floor in front of the ventilation tube she
	discovered earlier.  She squints through it.
	
	THROUGH THE TUBE,
	
	she can see out of the house, into the courtyard behind the
	brownstone.
	
	About thirty yards away she can see the backs of the
	brownstones on the next block, and directly across (because
	the tube doesn't leave much room for lateral vision) she can
	see straight into somebody's bedroom.
	
	There's a light on.  A SLEEPING MAN is in bed, an open book
	on his chest.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah sits back.
	
	She grabs the flashlight, looks for a little button on the
	top, the kind you can flick the flashlight on and off with.
	Shining it on the wall of the panic room, she flashes it at a
	wall, three times, on and off.  Satisfied, she turns back to
	the tube.
	
	Meg, curious, crawls across the floor to join her.  Sarah
	shoves the flashlight all the way into the tube, leaving
	enough room on either side of it for them to see through.
	Meg lays down flat, squints into the tube, Sarah alongside
	her.  She looks at her daughter, curious -- your plan?
	
	Sarah reaches into the tube, finds the little flash button on
	the top of the flashlight.
	
	THROUGH THE TUBE,
	
	the piercing halogen beam begins to flash, across the
	courtyard and into the bedroom of the Man in the bedroom.
	The light flashes on the wall over his bed.
	
	The flashes are in a rhythm.  Short.  Short.  Short.  Long.
	Long.  Long.  Short.  Short.  Short.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg turns to Sarah, impressed.
	
	                     MEG
	          Morse code?
	
	                     SARAH
	               (nods)
	          Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot
	          dot.
	
	                     MEG
	          Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
	
	                     SARAH
	          "Titanic."
	
	THROUGH THE TUBE,
	
	the flashes continue -- dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot
	dot.  But the Man continues to sleep, the light on the wall
	behind him has no effect.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah is frustrated.  She adjusts the flashlight.
	
	THROUGH THE TUBE,
	
	the beam of light lowers jerkily from the wall until it is
	shining directly into the Sleeping Man's eyes.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah strains to keep the light in that perfect spot.  She's
	starting to sweat.  Meg leans over, sneaks a peek at the
	watch Sarah wears on her left wrist.  The readout:
	
	114
	
	THROUGH THE TUBE,
	
	the Sleeping Man stirs.  Opens his eyes.  Winces from the
	light, which is flashing directly in his eyes.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	                     MEG
	          Got him!
	
	                     SARAH
	          Come on, come on...
	
	THROUGH THE TUBE,
	
	the Sleeping Man sits up.  Raises a hand, trying to block the
	light, which keeps flashing on him.
	
	He gets up, out of bed.  He comes to the window.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	                     MEG
	          Yes, yes, yes, yes...
	
	Sarah keeps it up, flashing faster.
	
	THROUGH THE TUBE,
	
	they see the Man come all the way to his window.  He leans
	against it, cups his hands so he can see better.  The flashes
	continue, right on top of him now.
	
	Clearly, the Man is reading the flashes!  He takes a steps
	back from the window --
	
	-- gives them the finger --
	
	-- and angrily yanks shut his drapes.
	
	A moment later, the light goes out and the room is black.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg and Sarah drop their heads to the carpet, defeated.
	
	Sarah rolls over, knocks the flashlight away, stares up at
	the ceiling.
	
	Meg puts a hand in her hair.  It was a good idea.
	
	                     SARAH
	          We're never getting out of here.
	
	                     MEG
	          Shhh...
	
	She looks at the wristwatch again.
	
	103
	
	She's concerned.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham is concerned as well.  He's still in the master
	bedroom, but barely, he's standing in the doorway, straining
	like hell to hear a conversation that Junior and Raoul are
	having in the foyer, one floor one.
	
	They're trying to keep their voices down, but stray words
	float up through the open stairwell -- words like "him" and
	"warning" and "dangerous."
	
	Burnham chews a fingernail.  If only he could get closer.  He
	throws a look back at the door to the panic room.  He looks
	back out the bedroom door.  Listening.
	
	INT.  FOYER - NIGHT
	
	Junior and Raoul are huddled together in the foyer.  They're
	keeping their voices low, but their conversation is heated.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          We're not gonna do anything about
	          him, he's fine.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          If you think I'm gonna let my half
	          of the fourteen million bucks slip
	          away because of --
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          "Half?"  What did you, take a nap in
	          math class?  Three people, three
	          shares, one third.  Four point six
	          six six repeating.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          I'm just saying, the man is a
	          problem.  And he's your problem.
	          Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your
	          idea, none of this was your idea, it
	          was mine, it's my family we're
	          ripping off, it's my prick
	          grandfather who built that fucking
	          room, it was my idea to get the
	          plans, I found the floor safe, and
	          it was my idea to ask a guy who
	          builds these rooms to help break
	          into one!  Me, me, me, I, I, I, at
	          no point did I say "you" or Raoul,"
	          got it?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          He puts his hands on me again I'll
	          bury a slug in his ear.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          No, you will not, because without
	          Burnham there's no way in hell we're
	          gonna get into that safe, so as far
	          as I'm concerned he can paint your
	          ass blue and run it up a flagpole
	          and you won't lay a finger on him,
	          you understand me?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Don't take no tone of voice with me,
	          Homes.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          What is this shit you're talking all
	          of a sudden?  You're a bus driver,
	          "Homes," you live in Flatbush, so
	          please don't start spouting some
	          Elmore Leonard shit you just heard
	          because I saw that movie too,
	
	ON THE VIDEO MONITORS,
	
	Junior and Raoul are visible, still arguing in the foyer.
	
	On the next monitor over, Burnham is visible, standing in the
	master bedroom doorway, listening.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg is watching the monitors, thinking.  She notices
	something, sits forward abruptly, looking at the monitor that
	covers the master bedroom.  She squeezes right up close,
	staring at the screen.
	
	ON THE MONITOR,
	
	we peer closely at the box next to her bed, the one she was
	using for a night table.  On top of the box, she sees the
	charger for her cellular phone, sitting empty.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg sits back, eyes alive with an idea.  If only she could
	get to that phone, which must be still under the bed.  She
	looks back at the monitors, at Burnham lingering in the
	doorway to the room.
	
	                     MEG
	          Damn.
	
	She turns away from the monitors, to check on Sarah, who's
	settled into a corner of the room, looking pale.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the bedroom, Burnham is desperate.  The argument
	downstairs is entering round two, and he's got to hear what
	they're saying.
	
	He takes a few steps out of the bedroom --
	
	INT.  THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	-- and comes into the hallway.  He leans over the stairwell.
	Where he's standing, he is directly under the camera that
	covers the hallway --
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	-- and can't be seen on the monitor that covers the hallway.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg turns back from Sarah, to look at the monitors again.
	She see Burnham is no longer in the bedroom.  And doesn't
	appear to be in the hallway, either.
	
	                     MEG
	          Oh yes, yes...
	
	She looks at another monitor.
	
	ON THE MONITOR,
	
	she sees Junior and Raoul in the foyer.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg sits back.  That leaves Burnham unaccounted for.
	
	                     MEG
	          ... the hell is he?
	
	IN THE HALLWAY,
	
	Burnham is still lingering under the camera.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah has come forward to the monitors as well.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Do it.
	
	                     MEG
	          Yeah, but where's the third guy?
	
	                     SARAH
	          Not in the bedroom.  Do it!
	
	Meg goes to the door, raises a hand to the green "open"
	button.  Hesitates.
	
	IN THE MASTER BEDROOM,
	
	we see Burnham, lurking in the hallway, just about six feet
	from the door to the panic room.  Don't open that door!
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg wipes sweat from her palm.
	
	                     MEG
	          If it looks like I can't get back,
	          just close the door.
	
	                     SARAH
	          No.
	
	                     MEG
	          Close it!
	
	Sarah nods, looks back to the button.
	
	IN THE HALLWAY,
	
	a shouted CURSE rises up from downstairs.  Burnham takes a
	step toward the stairs.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	he suddenly appears, in the hallway.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah sees it.
	
	                     SARAH
	          WAIT!
	
	Meg freezes.  She looks at the monitor, wide-eyed.  Close
	one.
	
	IN THE HALLWAY,
	
	Burnham can't take it anymore.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Oh, hell...
	
	He turns and takes off down the stairs.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	Burnham flies down the stairs and appears in the foyer, next
	to Junior and Raoul.   
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg and Sarah see all three men accounted for, downstairs.
	
	                     SARAH
	          GO GO GO!
	
	Meg leaps up, runs to the door, and punches the green button.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	The door begins to crank open, Meg slips through the gap
	sideways before it's even all the way open.  She darts across
	the room --
	
	-- slides to the floor next to the bed --
	
	-- and flattens herself, reaching underneath it to get the
	phone.  Damn, that phone slid far, it's right in the middle,
	wouldn't you know it.
	
	IN THE FOYER,
	
	the three men hear her footsteps, as one, they take off for
	the stairs.
	
	IN THE MASTER BEDROOM,
	
	Meg continues to stretch, her fingers inches from the phone.
	
	ON THE STAIRWELL,
	
	feet race up toward her --
	
	IN THE MASTER BEDROOM,
	
	Meg's fingernails paw the phone, pull it closer to her.  She
	grabs it, stands --
	
	IN THE HALLWAY,
	
	the three men come off the stairs and race toward her, they
	see her as she lunges across, toward the panic room, she
	hurls herself through the door --
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	-- and Sarah SMACKS the red button.  The steel door closes
	with a deafening WHANG.
	
	Safe.
	
	IN THE ENTRYWAY,
	
	the echo of the metallic WHANG reverberates through the
	house.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the panic room, Meg punches 9-1-1 on her cell phone with
	trembling fingers.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	The big empty charger cradle is in the foreground when the
	three men burst into the room.  Burnham stops in the middle
	of the floor, turns in a frantic circle.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          What'd she get, what'd she get,
	          what'd she get...
	
	His eyes fall on the empty charger.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Cell phone.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Shit!
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg raises the cell phone to her ear --
	
	-- and gets a rapid busy signal.
	
	                     MEG
	          Oh, no.  No, no, no no no no no...
	
	She looks at the phone.  It's showing just one signal bar,
	and even that one is flashing on and off.
	
	                     MEG
	          Oh come on, come on, come on...
	
	She walks around the room, raises the phone high and low,
	trying crazily to find a signal.
	
	But can't.   
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the bedroom, Burnham stands just outside the door,
	fingertips lightly resting on it, the ghost of a smile on his
	face.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	               (softly)
	          I don't think we'll be talking on
	          our cell phone from in there...
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Inside the room, Meg doesn't seem upset.  Rather, she's
	staring at the cell phone in her hand, thinking.  Remembering
	something.
	
	                     MEG
	          Wires...
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	At the same moment, Burnham is having the same thought.  He's
	still at the door, fingertips still resting there.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Phone...
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	                     MEG
	          ... wires.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham looks down, at the baseboard below.  What is he
	looking at?
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg steps up, onto the shelf she climbed earlier, and comes
	up next to the vent.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What are you doing?
	
	                     MEG
	          I saw something, I saw...
	
	In the vent, alongside the duct, she sees the bundle of
	multicolored wires she saw earlier.
	
	                     MEG
	          ... phone wires!
	
	She jumps down off the shelf, goes to the tools, starts
	searching for something.
	
	                     MEG
	          I may not have hooked up the phone
	          in here, but I hooked up the main
	          line, and there's a jack at the base
	          of this wall outside, I saw it!
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Yes, that is correct, there is in fact a jack in the base of
	the wall outside the door to the panic room.
	
	Burnham bends down into frame, studying it, thinking the same
	thing she is.  He clears his throat.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Say, while we're on the subject of
	          phones...
	
	He turns, looks up at Junior.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          When I said cut the line, did you
	          cut the main line at the junction
	          box in the basement like I said, and
	          which I repeated, or did you just
	          cut the cord on the phone in the
	          kitchen?
	
	Pause.  Swallow.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          I, uh, I...
	
	Shit.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          ... hit a little snag finding the
	          one in the basement.
	
	Shit.
	
	Pause.  Then, as if a starting gun has been fired, Burnham
	leaps to his feet and races out of the bedroom.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	That same starting gun has been fired in the panic room.
	With a strong RIP, Meg pulls the whole bundle of multi
	colored wires out of the wall and drops onto the floor with
	it.  She trusts it at Sarah, finds a wire cutter in the
	assorted tools, and gives her that too.
	
	                     MEG
	          Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue
	          first, blue is phones!
	
	                     SARAH
	          Blue is phones?
	
	                     MEG
	          Yes, no, I don't know, do 'em all!
	
	While Sarah goes to work on the wires, Meg turns to the phone
	itself, the one with the buried phone line that isn't working
	yet.  She rips the phone out of its housing, tears free the
	wire on the end of it.
	
	INT.  ENTRY FLOOR - NIGHT
	
	Burnham flies down the stairs from the third floor, races
	across the foyer, flies down the stairs to the kitchen floor.
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	Burnham races across the kitchen floor, whips open a door and
	heads down another, narrow, darkened stairway.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg and Sarah are like animals, clawing and tearing at the
	ends of their respective phone cables, foregoing tools and
	stripping the wires with fingers and teeth, it's faster.
	
	With the phone receiver cradled on her shoulder, Meg starts
	twisting the ends of wires onto the exposed ends of the wires
	from the phone unit.  First wire -- nothing.  She tries a
	second wire.
	
	INT.  MECHANICAL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham SLAMS open the door to a dark room, pulls the string
	on a bare bulb.  Burned out.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          God damn it!
	
	Without light, he can't see a thing.  He SMACKS the bulb, it
	swings wildly, SMASHES on the cement wall.  He turns and
	races out of the room.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg tries another wire.  Still no dial tone.  Sarah shoves
	another wire at her.  She tries again.  Nothing.  She moves
	on.
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham slides to his knees, snatches a flashlight from his
	duffel, leaps up and takes off again.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Another wire.  Nothing.  Another wire.  DIAL TONE!
	
	Meg SHRIEKS and punches 911.
	
	INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT
	
	Burnham flies down the stairs, flashlight beam bouncing
	crazily in front of him.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	The phone is ringing.  An operator picks up.
	
	                     OPERATOR
	          911 emergency --
	
	                     MEG
	          I'm at 26 West --
	
	                     OPERATOR
	          -- please hold.
	
	It's a mechanical voice, which gives over to MUZAK.
	
	                     MEG
	          NO!
	
	INT.  MECHANICAL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham BANGS through the door again, starts searching the
	darkened mechanical room, shining harsh light around its
	dingy walls.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	MUZAK continues to play.
	
	                     MEG
	          Damn it!
	
	No more time to hold.  Meg hangs up the phone, dials another
	number, a seven digit one she knows by heart.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Call Dad!
	
	                     MEG
	          On it!
	
	INT.  MECHANICAL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the mechanical room, the bouncing flashlight beam falls on
	a metal cabinet across the way.  Burnham runs to it, flings
	it open.  Circuit breakers.  SLAMS it shut.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg listens as a phone rings on the other end.  And rings.
	And rings again.
	
	This is torture.
	
	INT.  MECHANICAL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham turns, sees another, smaller metal box, this one
	clearly labeled:
	
	PHONES
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	On the other end of the phone, a husky MALE VOICE answers;
	clearly he's been awakened.
	
	                     VOICE
	          Hello?
	
	                     MEG
	          Listen to me!  There are three --
	
	INT.  MECHANICAL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	With a subhuman ROAR of anger, Burnham rips the entire phone
	panel off the wall with his bare hands.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	With an abrupt SHRIEK, the line goes dead.  Meg pauses, can't
	believe it.
	
	                     MEG
	          Hello?  Don't... are...
	
	She looks up, see Sarah looking at her, her eyebrows arches,
	her face all hope.  Meg keeps her cool, but it take a hell of
	an effort.
	
	Sarah reads her face.  She turns away.
	
	She hangs up the phone.
	
	Sarah goes to a corner of the room, faces away from her.
	
	Meg doesn't know what to say.
	
	                     MEG
	          He'll do something.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Uh uh.
	
	                     MEG
	          He'll know we're in trouble.  He
	          heard me, I said "There are
	          three..."
	
	                     SARAH
	          He won't even know who it was.
	
	                     MEG
	          What would you think, in the middle
	          of the night?  I mean, three what,
	          three bears?  He'll call the police.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Stop it.
	
	                     MEG
	          He's just across the park, this is
	          why we got places so close to each
	          other, in case we needed each other,
	          we're still a family, he'll help
	          us...
	
	                     SARAH
	          He --
	
	                     MEG
	          He WILL.
	
	She practically shouted.  Sarah drop her head into her arms.
	
	                     MEG
	          I'm sorry.
	
	                     SARAH
	          I'm sorry.
	
	                     MEG
	          Why?
	
	                     SARAH
	          I was trying not to tell you...
	
	                     MEG
	          What?
	
	                     SARAH
	          I'm dizzy and thirsty.
	
	Meg blanches.  This is very bad news.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Tired, Burnham drags himself back up the stairs and into the
	doorway of the master bedroom.  Raoul and Junior stand there,
	staring at him.
	
	Long pause.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          She's never coming out.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Hey.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          And we're never getting in.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Do me a favor and don't talk.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Jesus, what was I thinking?
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg has torn open one of the water packets and is trying to
	get Sarah to drink, but the little girl has gone completely
	pale and seems to have lost some of the strength in her neck,
	she's having trouble holding her head up.  Most of the water
	runs down her chin.
	
	                     MEG
	          Come on, come on... stay with me...
	          you gotta drink...
	
	She takes Sarah's hand, checks her wristwatch thing.  The
	readout is now
	
	82
	
	She swallows.  She grabs Sarah by the face.
	
	                     MEG
	          Okay, listen, honey, you went double
	          digit here, you must have been
	          shooting out adrenaline like crazy,
	          we gotta bring your blood sugar back
	          up, okay?  Can you hear me?
	
	                     SARAH
	          I'm dizzy, not deaf.
	
	                     MEG
	          Hey, she's still a smart ass,
	          excellent sign.  Did you see any
	          sugar in here?  Any candy bars,
	          anything sweet?
	
	                     SARAH
	          Huh uh.
	
	                     MEG
	          Okay, you just gotta calm yourself
	          down, that's all, just stay calm and
	          your adrenaline will go back to
	          normal and you'll be fine.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What if I keep dropping?
	
	                     MEG
	          Not an option.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What if I do?
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the bedroom, Junior has had enough.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          We're leaving.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          The hell we are.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Hey man, after all we went through I
	          am not walking out when we're this
	          close.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Close?  Are you insane?  We're
	          nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll
	          make an anonymous phone call on
	          Monday, they'll find the floor safe,
	          and I'll inherit the shit.  Little
	          piece of it, anyway, it's better
	          than nothing.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          What about us?
	
	Junior thinks, then pulls out his wallet.  He thrusts a
	fistful of bills at them.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Here.  For your time.
	
	They both just stare at him.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Five hundred bucks here.
	
	Neither one of them moves to take it.  Junior shurgs, drops
	it on the floor.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Suit yourself.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Nobody leaves.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Observe.
	
	He heads for the door, expecting Raoul to block him, but as
	he draws close --
	
	-- Raoul just steps out of the way.  Junior passes through
	and heads for the stairs.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          We're not leaving.  I'm getting in
	          that room, and I'm opening that
	          safe.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but
	          ten out of ten for attitude.
	
	And he disappears, down the stairs, Burnham still pleading
	with him.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg rifles the foodstuffs that are stored in the room.
	Sarah, in the corner, is starting to tremble.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What if I spazz out?
	
	                     MEG
	               (forced calm)
	          No biggie, we've been through it a
	          dozen times, I just jab you with the
	          Glucogen.
	
	Pause.  She keeps looking.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Where is the Glucogen?
	
	                     MEG
	          Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the

	                     SARAH
	               (pause)
	          I'm sorry, Mom.
	
	                     MEG
	          Hey, quit apologizing, you're
	          starting to sound like Grandma.
	          You're not gonna have an attack.
	          Okay?
	
	                     SARAH
	          Okay.   
	
	She lays back, oddly passive, her lips changing color.  She
	stares at the monitors.
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Junior strides into the living room, purposefully.  He tosses
	some tools into his duffel bag and heads for the stairs down
	to the kitchen.  Burnham is behind him.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Would you wait?  Would you please
	          just wait a minute?
	
	But Junior heads down.  Burnham follows.  Raoul is just
	coming down from upstairs.
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	Junior reaches the door of the kitchen, tries to open it,
	realizes it's screwed shut.  He takes out a screwdriver and
	starts unscrewing the screws.  Burnham stops at the stairway.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          You walk out that door and you lose
	          your share of the money.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Yeah, whatever.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I mean it!
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Adios.
	
	He gets the last screw out, throws open the door, and BLAST
	of wind gusts in, it's a blustery night out there, he takes a
	step into the doorway --
	
	-- and with a quiet PFFFT from right behind Burnham, a bullet
	whizzes across the kitchen and hits Junior in the back of the
	head.  He crumples, right in the open kitchen doorway.
	
	Burnham SHOUTS incoherently and turns.  Raoul is standing
	there, two steps up, a silencer twisted onto the barrel of
	his gun.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Nobody leaves.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Sarah is staring at the video monitors, eyes wide.  She
	raises one trembling finger, points at the kitchen monitor,
	tries to mouth the words, can't.
	
	Meg looks up.
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	Burnham is freaking out, but trying to stay calm.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Oh God... oh, my God...
	
	Raoul walks past him calmly, grabs Junior by the ankles, and
	drags him back into the house.  He turns, looks at Burnham,
	whose jaw is dropped in horror.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You should see the look on your
	          face.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          The fuck did you do that for?!
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Fuckin' asshole, thinks he knows me.
	          Drives his German car up to 125th
	          Street a couple of times, buys a few
	          rounds, thinks he's a tough guy,
	          thinks he knows me.
	               (to the corpse)
	          You don't know one thing about me!
	
	While Burnham stares down at the body in shock and Raoul
	stares at Burnham, his back to the outside, a small, thin
	VOICE comes from the still-open doorway.
	
	                     VOICE
	          What the h --
	
	They turn.  A man, fiftyish, stands there in hastily thrown
	on clothes, staring down at the dead body in mute shock.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg, watching the monitors with Sarah, GASPS as she sees the
	man, whose name is HARRIS.  While she and Sarah watch --
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	-- they see the silent image of Harris, set upon by Raoul,
	who grabs him roughly and drags him inside.  Burnham hurries
	to the door --
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	-- and SLAMS it shut.  He puts his back to it, thinking,
	terrified, things are spinning out of control, fast.
	
	Raoul, in the middle of the kitchen floor, is venting some
	more of his rage on Harris, whom he has hurled to the floor.
	He lands a solid boot in the side of Harris's head, leaving
	him GROANING in pain, completely disoriented.
	
	Harris rolls groggily into the spreading pool of blood coming
	from underneath Junior.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Stop it!  Stop it!
	
	                     RAOUL
	               (turning on him)
	          Who's the clown now?  Huh?!  Who's
	          the fucking clown now?!
	
	He pulls his gun, shoves it into Burnham's eye, hard, we can
	hear the faint SIZZLE of skin burning.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Me.  I am.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          That's right.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          I have the gun.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Yes.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Remember that.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Please...
	
	Raoul pulls the gun back, just an inch.  The skin around
	Burnham's eye is an angry red.  His eyes dart, strain to look
	over at Harris, MOANING on the floor.  And at Junior, dead.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          What?  What do you want me to do?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          What do you think?  Get us into that
	          room.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I can't.
	
	Raoul pushes the gun barrel back into Burnham's eye socket.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You can.  You're full of ideas.  You
	          just need to squeeze one out.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I can't...
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You got till the count of three.
	          Then you end up like him.
	
	He tilts his head over to Junior, whose brains are spreading
	out on the kitchen floor.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          One.  Squeeze.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          This is ridiculous...
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Two.  Squeeze harder.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I can't just...
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Th --
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Okay, okay!  Okay.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You got an idea?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Yeah.  Yeah, I got an idea.  I gotta
	          check something.
	
	Raoul GRUNTS, satisfied.  Pulls the gun back.  Burnham slides
	away, shaking.  He bends down, to the floor.  He looks at
	Harris's left hand.  At his index finger.
	
	He sees a white strip of skin, where Harris wore his wedding
	ring, until recently.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Harris, still semi-conscious, is hurled against the metal
	door of the panic room.  He collapses at its base.  Burnham,
	bends down next to him.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Okay, look.  I know you can hear me.
	          Your wife and kid are in there.
	          You're gonna get 'em to come out.
	          Or --
	
	He looks up at Raoul, hulking overhead, gun in hand.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Or I can't stop what he's gonna do.
	          Do you understand?
	
	Harris, regaining some semblance of consciousness, nods
	feebly.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Good.
	
	Burnham stands up, turns to the video camera, and SHOUTS.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          OPEN THE GOD DAMN DOOR!
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Sarah and Meg see the horrifying sight on the video monitors.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham SHOUTS at the door to the room.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          OPEN UP!
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	they see Burnham, standing over Harris; they faintly hear him
	call to them to open the door.
	
	And then they hear another VOICE, calling back to them.
	Sarah sits up, recognizes her father's voice.
	
	                     SARAH (O.S.)
	          DADDY!
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Harris is SHOUTING against the closed door.
	
	                     HARRIS
	          DON'T DO IT!  NO MATTER WHAT
	          HAPPENS, DON'T OPEN THE DOOR!
	          DON'T O --
	
	He's silenced by a vicious kick to the ribs.  Raoul begins to
	beat him.
	
	Burnham stands by, powerless, horrifies, watching as Raoul
	savages Harris, who continues to call out, as long as he has
	strength, telling Meg not to open the door, no matter what.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg and Sarah SHOUT in horror, she covers her daughter's
	face, turn her away from the screen, SCREAMS in incoherent
	anger of her own.
	
	But she doesn't open the door.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham SHOUTS at Raoul, pleading.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          STOP IT, MAN, STOP IT, THAT'S HIS
	          KID IN THERE, HIS KID IS WATCHING
	          THIS!!
	
	But Raoul whips the gun up, into Burnham's throat, backing
	him off, shutting him up.
	
	He resumes his pounding of Harris.
	
	Burnham turns, looks up at the camera in the corner of the
	room.
	
	He can't stand it anymore.  He whips off his jacket, runs to
	the camera, and covers the lens.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	While Meg watches, the monitor that cover the master bedroom
	abruptly goes black, mercifully sparing them the sight of
	Harris's beating.
	
	She holds Sarah, who's sobbing, shaking.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Harris finally lapses into unconsciousness.  Raoul stands
	over him, chest heaving.
	
	Burnham stand in the doorway, neither in nor out of the room,
	a silhouette, head hung.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg tries desperately to see something on the bedroom
	monitor, but it's hopeless, it's covered.  On the hallway
	monitor, she can just see shadows, as two men in the bedroom
	lift a third off the floor and carry him across the room.
	
	A sudden BEEPING sound tears her attention away.  Still
	holding Sarah, she pulls her back, off her shoulder.  Her
	face is completely white, her lips blue, her eyes rolled back
	into her head.  The BEEPING sound grows louder, she checks
	Sarah's wristwatch, the reading is dire:
	
	57
	
	Meg GASPS, horrifies.
	
	                     MEG
	          Oh God, oh my God...
	
	Sarah begins to convulse, she bucks right out of Meg's arms
	and falls back onto the floor of the panic room.  Meg clears
	everything away from her, tries to make room for her.
	
	The convulsion worsens.  Meg searches through the piles of
	supplies, comes up with a plastic-handled screwdriver.  She
	opens Sarah's jaws, wedges the plastic handle between her
	teeth.
	
	She helps Sarah ride out the convulsion.  Finally, her eyes
	roll back into her head, she slowly re-orients herself.
	Sarah reaches over, turns off her still-BEEPING
	wristwatch/monitor herself.
	
	Sarah sighs, a shuddering sigh of relief, but she is nowhere
	near normal.
	
	Her skin has passed through white and is turning a sallow
	yellow color.  She moves her lips, Meg can't hear her, she
	bends down:
	
	                     SARAH
	          You gotta jab me, Mommy...
	
	Meg turns, looks back at the monitors.  What she sees is good
	news --
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	the jacket has been removed from the bedroom camera.  Burnham
	and Raoul are gone, the only person there is HARRIS, who lies
	slumped on the far side of the bed.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg looks quickly over at the monitor for the living room.
	
	ON THAT MONITOR,
	
	she sees Burnham and Raoul having an urgent conversation,
	Burnham sitting in a chair, Raoul pacing in front of him,
	ranting.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg's face lights up, she practically laughs, she's so
	overjoyed at this turn of events.
	
	She turns, looks back at Sarah, who is starting to tremble
	again.
	
	That does it.  Meg leaps up, hits the button that controls
	the steel door, and it starts to crank open, almost
	impossibly slowly.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg steps out of the panic room, into the master bedroom.
	She looks at Harris, on the bed.  With his back to her she
	can't even tell if he's alive or dead, but first things must
	be first, so she turns and races out of the room.
	
	INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	Meg flies up the stairs, bare feet on padded carpet.
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the living room, Raoul looks up, hearing the pitter-pat of
	her feet on the stairs above.
	
	He smiles and pulls his ski mask back on, to cover his face.
	
	Coming around behind him, we see Burnham sitting in the
	chair.  Except it isn't Burnham at all, it's Harris,
	unconscious, wearing Burnham's shirt.
	
	And if Harris is the person in the chair, that means --
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	-- the person on the bed in the bedroom is Burnham, wearing
	Harris's shirt.  His eyes pop open, he sits up, sees the wide
	open door to the panic room.
	
	INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg races into Sarah's bedroom and tears open the door of a
	mini-fridge.  Inside are dozens of little bottles of insulin
	and something called Glucogen.
	
	She grabs a bottle of Glucogen and a black leather pouch and
	takes off.
	
	INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	As Meg nears the bottom of the stairs, she sees a horrifying
	sight.  It's Raoul, ski mask over his face, standing in the
	doorway of the master bedroom.
	
	She SCREAMS, he SLAMS the door, she takes off down the hall,
	reaches the end, throws the door open --
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	-- and races into the master bedroom, where Raoul is
	motoring, fast, headed for the panic room, where she can
	already see Burnham, standing in the middle of the open
	doorway, in front of Sarah, wearing Harris's shirt and a grim
	"tricked you" expression.
	
	Meg hurls herself at Raoul, lands clinging to his back.  She
	claws and wrestles with him, gets one hand on his ski mask,
	tears it from his head.  He reaches up to try to stop her
	from pulling it off --
	
	-- his gun slips from his fingers, falls to the floor --
	
	-- and caroms off his boot, spinning across the floor away
	from them.
	
	Raoul flips her off his back violently, she CRUNCHES to the
	floor, clutching his mask and getting a good long look at his
	face.  He makes a move toward his gun, but she's faster,
	she's already pawing herself frantically across the hardwood
	toward it.
	
	Raoul measures the distance, knows he'll lose, and sprints
	for the panic room instead.  Meg turns, looks down at the
	medicine in her hands, then at the door to the panic room,
	where Raoul is right now reaching up to push the button that
	controls the steel door.
	
	She makes a fast decision and lunges, hurling the plastic
	bottle of Glucogen and the black leather pouch through the
	gap just before --
	
	-- the spring-loaded steel door SLAMS shut with tremendous
	ferocity.
	
	And then it's silent.  Meg WAILS in agony, POUNDS on the
	door.
	
	She stands back, chest heaving, sobbing.
	
	A looooong moment goes by.
	
	Finally, a VOICE comes over the house's intercom system.
	
	                     RAOUL (O.S.)
	               (calmly)
	          If you leave the house, we'll kill
	          her.
	
	Meg sobs.
	
	                     RAOUL (O.S.)
	          If I see a uniform in the house,
	          we'll kill her.
	
	                     MEG
	          Oh... oh...
	
	                     RAOUL (O.S.)
	          You understand?
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	Meg looks up at the camera in the master bedroom.  She nods,
	terrified.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Burnham pushes past Raoul, at the speaker button, and leans
	forward.  He's approaching exhaustion.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	               (into speaker)
	          I just... I just need forty-five
	          minutes.
	
	Raoul stands behind him, muttering to himself.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Saw my face, man.  Saw my face.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	we see Meg's face, agonized, as she lunges toward the camera,
	SCREAMING something up at it, the same thing, over and over.
	But in here her voice is nearly muted, what bleeds through
	the walls isn't enough to be heard.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Raoul looks at her image on the monitor, irritated.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Shut up.
	
	IN THE MASTER BEDROOM,
	
	we abruptly hear her voice, full-throated.
	
	                     MEG
	               (shouting into the camera)
	          -- cine, she needs the MEDICINE!
	          GIVE HER THE --
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah shivers in a corner, knees pulled up to her chest,
	staring at the intruders, scared out of her wits, and looking
	very, very sick.
	
	Burnham looks at her, musters the most reassuring face he can
	come up with under the circumstances.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          It's gonna be cool, kid.  Be outta
	          here before you know it.
	
	No response from Sarah.  Burnham cocks a head, really looking
	at her.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Are you okay?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
	
	Burnham turns, grabs his satchel, and drops to his knees in
	the middle of the floor.  Over his shoulder, we can see the
	face of Meg on one of the monitors, shouting into the camera,
	begging them to give Sarah her medicine.
	
	Using his hand, Burnham measures six lengths in from the
	wall, then digs his fingernails into the weave of the carpet,
	looking for a seam.
	
	He finds one, gets hold of it on one edge, and runs his other
	hand along the seam till he finds a place where it seems to
	turn a corner.  He stands, hovering over the carpet, and
	pulls back evenly with both hands.
	
	The concealed carpet flap pulls back neatly, with the soft
	sound of tearing VELCRO.  Underneath the flap --
	
	-- is the smooth metal door of a floor safe.
	
	Burnham unsnaps his satchel and gives it a shove.  It rolls
	out and opens up onto the floor, revealing a neat array of
	safecracking tools.
	
	He begins his delicate work, but is suddenly jarred by a
	POUNDING on the metal door.  He turns, annoyed.  Meg is still
	SCREAMING outside the door.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          The hell does she want?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          I don't know, she keeps screamin'
	          the same thing over and over.
	
	Burnham turns, looks at the monitors.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	Meg is staring up at the camera, miming the act of giving
	herself an injection in the arm.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Raoul laughs.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Drugs.  She wants drugs.  What the
	          fuck?
	
	But Burnham thinks.  His eyes fall on the bottle and the
	leather pouch she hurled through the door, then whip over to
	Sarah, who sags over into a fetal position on the floor.  Her
	lips are moving.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Oh, man...
	
	He crawls over to Sarah, puts his ear down next to Sarah's
	lips.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          What is it?
	
	Sarah tries to summon enough strength to speak, but her
	breath comes hard.
	
	                     SARAH
	          I need...
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Yeah?
	
	                     SARAH
	          ... 'jection...
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          An injection?
	
	Sarah nods.  Burnham points to the pouch and the Glucogen, on
	the floor nearby.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          That stuff?
	
	Sarah nods again.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Can you do it yourself?
	
	Sarah shakes her head no.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Well, I don't know how.
	
	Sarah looks at him, eyes pleading.  Raoul stands behind
	Burnham.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          I don't fucking believe this.
	               (to Sarah)
	          You gotta wait.
	
	Sarah just looks at Burnham.  Please.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a
	          little more, and your mom'll give it
	          to you.  You can wait a half hour,
	          can't you?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's
	          just like, tired, she's gotta rest.
	          You rest, Kid.  Half an hour.
	
	Sarah looks terrified, shaking her head no.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Come on.
	
	He starts to pull Burnham away, but Burnham shakes his hand
	off, violently.  He bends down very close to Sarah's lips.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Tell me the truth, okay?  What's
	          gonna happen if you don't get this?
	
	Sarah swallows, licks her cracking lips.  When she speaks,
	it's breathy, almost inaudible.
	
	But the words are clear.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Coma.  Die.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Seen from overhead, Meg paces in the master bedroom, out of
	her mind with worry, no idea how to communicate to the people
	in the room the desperate situation.
	
	Suddenly, a VOICE comes over the intercom speaker.
	
	                     BURNHAM (O.S.)
	          I understand.  I'll give her the
	          shot.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	A HAND comes down into frame and picks up the Glucogen and
	the leather pouch.  Burnham stands, looking down at them.
	Raoul grabs him, pulls him to the far end of the room.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You're wasting your fucking time,
	          man, you're wasting my time.  You
	          don't know how to do this, and the
	          longer we stay in here, the more
	          likely she's gonna lose it and call
	          the cops!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Are you gonna open the safe?
	
	Raoul looks at him.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Then shut up and get out of my way.
	
	As Burnham crosses the room, Raoul makes eye contact with
	Sarah, who is staring at him.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Don't look at me.
	
	ACROSS THE ROOM,
	
	Burnham drops to his knees next to Sarah and unzips the
	pouch.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Okay, kid, all I know about this is
	          what I've seen on TV, you gotta talk
	          me through it.
	
	Sarah tries to form words, but she's too weak.  Burnham
	swallows.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Okay.  No talking.  No problem.  TV
	          don't lie, right?
	
	He reaches into the pouch, take out a syringe, a sterile pad,
	and a length of rubber tubing.  He takes Sarah's arm,
	stretches it out, exposing the underside of her forearm.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          You seem like a good kid.  Your
	          mom... only saw her for a second,
	          but, woah.  Beautiful, huh?
	
	No answer.  Burnham ties the rubber tubing around Sarah's
	arm, pulls it tight.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Hey, nod or something, show me
	          you're still alive, will ya?
	
	Sarah nods.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Attagirl.  That too tight?
	
	Sarah shakes her head no.  Burnham takes the syringe, starts
	to fill it from the Glucogen bottle.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          You guys are pretty rich, huh?
	
	Sarah shrugs.  While Burnham goes through the process of
	finding an exposed vein and giving the injection itself, he
	goes on, as much to comfort Sarah as to comfort himself:
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Yeah, you don't think about that
	          stuff.  Good for you.
	
	He looks at her, sees her looking at him.  Thinking about
	him.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I know, I know.  I really screwed
	          the pooch this time.  I never did
	          anything like this before.  Break
	          into somebody's house?  Not even
	          close.  Bad cards, Kid.  I swear to
	          God, I been on the wrong end of
	          maybe six straight years of bad
	          cards.  House.  Car.  Wife.
	               (snaps his fingers --
	                gone)
	          Those are some seriously bad cards.
	          And still, every time I pick up a
	          fresh hand I swear to God, the rush
	          comes so hot and prickly I feel it
	          right down to my toes because this
	          time, this one time, it might be
	          there, this time it might be that
	          hand, that perfect hand, that
	          monster hand.
	               (shakes his head)
	          And you thought you were sick.
	
	The shot successfully given, he pulls Sarah's sleeve back
	down.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Feel better?
	
	Sarah nods, and she seems better already.  Burnham helps her
	to sit up, to lean against the wall.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Woulda been a hell of a dad.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	A VOICE comes over the intercom in the master bedroom.  It's
	Raoul.
	
	                     RAOUL (O.S.)
	          She's okay.  Now sit down and wait.
	
	He CLICKS off.
	
	Meg is hugely relieved.  And extremely pissed off.  She goes
	to the corner of the room and picks up the gun, the one that
	Raoul dropped.
	
	She heads downstairs.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Sparks fly as Burnham goes to work on the floor safe with a
	small, specialized drill.
	
	Raoul bends down next to him.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Congratulations.  You saved her life
	          for ten minutes.
	
	Burnham looks up at him -- what?  But Raoul turns and walks
	away.
	
	Burnham goes back to work.
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg is in the living room, with Harris, who is still slouched
	in the chair.  He's in awful shape, barely conscious.
	
	Out of the silence, a sudden, deafening sound.
	
	The DOORBELL.
	
	Her eyes go wide.  She darts a look over to the door (the one
	that leads to the stoop, not the bloody kitchen door
	downstairs), then back at Harris.
	
	                     HARRIS
	          Police.
	
	                     MEG
	               (gasps)
	          You called the police?
	
	He nods.
	
	                     HARRIS
	          You... scared...
	
	Shit.  This is exactly what she prayed for him to do, now
	it's the worst thing that could happen.
	
	She stands, thinking, desperate.  She walks toward the door,
	stops, thinks some more.
	
	The doorbell RINGS again.
	
	She comes up with a plan.  She goes back to where Harris is
	in the chair, pulls the chair back a few feet, out of view of
	the door.  She puts the gun in his lap, puts his hand over it
	to steady it.
	
	She leans down, WHISPERS to him.
	
	                     MEG
	          Don't.  Say.  A word.
	
	He nods.
	
	Meg takes a breath, walks across the foyer, tousling her hair
	as she goes.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Raoul is staring at the monitors, aghast.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Holy shit... holy shit...
	
	Burnham races over, looks over his shoulder.  One monitor
	covers the front stoop, and on that monitor they can clearly
	see TWO UNIFORMED COPS.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          She's fuckin' crazy, she killed the
	          kid!  She just killed her own kid!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          It's not her fault, it's not her
	          fault, the guy must have called
	          them.  Look, look, look, she's
	          telling us.
	
	He points to another monitor, the one in the foyer, where Meg
	is looking up at the camera, miming to them -- don't worry,
	I'll take care of this.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          She's gonna handle it.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          She better.
	
	INT.  ENTRY FLOOR - NIGHT
	
	Meg's shaking hand rises up to the doorknob and pulls open
	the big front door.  On the stoop, the two Cops turn to look
	at her.  She acts as if she's just been awakened.  She looks
	it, too, still in T-shirt and boxer shorts.  The wind is
	gusty and cold outside.
	
	                     MEG
	          Yeah?
	
	                     COP 1
	          Everything okay?
	
	                     MEG
	          Huh?
	
	                     COP 2
	          Are you all right?
	
	                     MEG
	          What are you guys -- what time is
	          it?
	
	                     COP 1
	          'Bout four o'clock.
	
	                     MEG
	          I don't get it.
	
	                     COP 2
	          We got a call...
	
	Cop 1 looks at him.  Cop 2 stops talking.
	
	                     MEG
	          Somebody called you?
	
	                     COP 1
	          Can we come in?
	
	                     MEG
	          What do you want?
	
	                     COP 1
	          We'd like to come in.
	
	                     MEG
	          No, you can't come in.
	
	                     COP 2
	          Are you okay?
	
	                     MEG
	          I'm fine.
	
	                     COP 1
	          Can we come in?
	
	                     MEG
	          Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who
	          called you?
	
	                     COP 1
	          You don't look so good.
	
	                     MEG
	          You wake me out of a sound sleep at
	          four in the morning and then tell me
	          I look like hell?  Of course I look
	          like hell, you don't look so hot
	          yourself, Jack.  I'm freezing here,
	          thank you for checking, can I go?
	
	Cop 1 studies her, notices the burned sleeve of her T-shirt,
	the black smudges still on her face.
	
	                     COP 1
	          Your husband says you said "There
	          are three..." right before you got
	          cut off.
	
	                     MEG
	          Oh, that phone call...
	
	Cop 1 takes a step forward and lowers his voice to just above
	a whisper, unconsciously making her lean forward in order to
	hear him.
	
	                     COP 1
	          Ma'am, if there's something you want
	          to say to us right now that maybe
	          you can't say to us right now, maybe
	          you just want to make a signal, by
	          blinking a few times, something like
	          that.
	
	She just looks at him.  Wow, this guy's intuitive.  She is
	sorely tempted.  But she can't.
	
	                     COP 1
	          That's something you could do.
	          Safely.
	
	She thinks, thinks --
	
	-- and burst out laughing.
	
	                     MEG
	          Man, you are good!  You mean, like,
	          if somebody was in the house or
	          something?  That's great, they
	          really train you guys these days,
	          don't they?
	
	Cop 1 looks at her, not sure if he believes her or not.
	
	                     MEG
	          No.  I'm fine.  Cross my heart.
	
	Cop 2 turns to go, but Cop 1 lingers.
	
	                     COP 1
	          May I ask what the rest of that
	          sentence was going to be?
	
	                     MEG
	               (stalling)
	          Huh?
	
	                     COP 1
	          The sentence that started "There are
	          three."  What was the rest?
	
	Pause.  She stares at him.
	
	                     MEG
	          Okay, look.  My husband and I just
	          broke up.  It's my first night in
	          the new house, and I was feeling a
	          little lonely and a little drunk.
	          The sentence, if you insist on
	          knowing, was going to be "There are
	          three things I'll do for you if you
	          come over right now and get in bed
	          with me."
	
	Cop 2 stifles a laugh.
	
	                     MEG
	          But thank God I came to my senses
	          before I said all that and hung up
	          instead, so nobody would ever know
	          what I was thinking, unless, of
	          course, two policemen showed up in
	          the middle of the night to
	          interrogate me about it.
	
	That was good.  Cop 1 is embarrassed.  Cop 2 thinks it's
	funny.
	
	                     COP 2
	          You want her to show you which three
	          things, Rick, or should we just go?
	
	Cop 1 looks at Meg, a long look, he holds it for one last
	moment, trying to read her mind.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	we see the video image of the Cops as they turn and head away
	down the front steps.  Meg closes the doors, looks up into a
	camera, right at us.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Burnham and Raoul breathe a sigh of relief.
	
	Burnham goes back to work on the safe.  He's making progress.
	
	Raoul looks at Sarah.  Stares actually.  He's thinking too.
	
	Bad thoughts.  He moves over, crouches down next to Burnham.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          She saw my face.  The kid too.
	
	Sarah overhears that.  She raises her head, alarmed.  Burnham
	turns, looks over at her, and she just gets her head back
	down in time.  Burnham and Raoul close themselves off, for a
	private conversation.
	
	Sarah edges closer.  She overhears a fragment.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          That's your problem.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          That's their problem.
	
	Sarah is terrified.  Doesn't know what to do.  She looks to
	her immediate left, sees the intercom panel.  She edges
	closer.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Let me fucking finish this so we can
	          get out of here.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You finish.  Then we finish.
	
	Sarah sneaks up a hand and pushes a button -- "ALL PAGE."
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the living room, there is an audible CLICK as the speaker
	is activated.  Meg looks up, hears Burnham's voice, in the
	middle of a sentence.
	
	                     BURNHAM (O.S.)
	          -- posed to mean?
	
	                     RAOUL (O.S.)
	          You're here with me, you're already
	          on the hook for one.  Buy one, you
	          get the rest for the same price.
	          You know that.
	
	                     BURNHAM (O.S.)
	          Get the fuck away from me.
	
	                     RAOUL (O.S.)
	          The kid in here.  The other two when
	          we come out.
	
	Meg listens, horrified.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Sarah holds the intercom button down with a trembling finger.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Bullshit.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You know how this gotta end.
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg stares, in shock, as Raoul's voice echoes in the empty
	room.
	
	                     RAOUL (O.S.)
	          They stay in the house.
	
	There in an abrupt CLICK, and the speaker turns off.  Meg
	turns, goes to Harris, falls to her knees, no idea what to
	do.  She holds him close, their foreheads touching.  She's
	terrified, exhausted, wants to collapse in his arms.
	
	Instead, she starts to pull the gun from his fingers.  He
	tightens his grip, what are you doing?  He tries to hold onto
	the gun, but she pulls his fingers off it, takes it away from
	him.  He is too weak to resist.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the panic room, Sarah has her hands clamped over her ears,
	her mouth is wide open, and a hideous METAL SHRIEK seems to
	be coming out of it.
	
	But the SHRIEK is actually coming from the safe, where
	Burnham continues to work, another drill, a bigger bit.  The
	noise is deafening.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	Sarah sees her mother approaching the monitor in the bedroom,
	carrying a jacket.  Meg tosses the jacket, this time she
	doesn't want them to see what she's doing.
	
	The monitor goes black.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the master bedroom, Meg pulls on a pair of jeans that are
	hanging over a chair.
	
	She steps into a pair of boots.
	
	She shoves the gun into her belt.
	
	Here in the bedroom, she can hear the drill.  From the house
	next door, she hears POUNDING again, more MUFFLED CURSES.
	Apparently the neighbor can hear the drill too.
	
	Meg looks from the walls of the bedroom to the walls of the
	panic room.  Her eyes light up with an idea.
	
	She goes to the front wall of the bedroom, stands with her
	back against the exterior wall (street side), with her left
	shoulder against the common wall that's shared with the
	neighbor's brownstone.
	
	She begins to step off the distance, heel to toe, measuring
	with her feet until she reaches the metal door that is the
	entrance to the panic room.
	
	                     MEG
	          Fourteen.
	
	She hurries out of the bedroom.  What's she doing?
	
	INT.  LIBRARY - NIGHT
	
	Meg comes into a small room full of empty bookshelves, a
	library.  There is a window that looks out over the sidewalk,
	one floor up, same level as the stoop.
	
	She looks up, into the corners of the room.
	
	                     MEG
	          No camera, no camera, no camera...
	
	They're bare, no video cameras.  Good.
	
	She goes to the window, tries to open it.  Screwed shut, of
	course.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	The safe is almost cracked.  Raoul is watching the monitors
	carefully.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	we see Meg as she searches through the tools in the living
	room, finds a screwdriver, a sledgehammer.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Raoul furrows his brow.  Now what?
	
	INT.  LIBRARY - NIGHT
	
	Meg is back in the library, hurriedly unscrewing the window.
	She gets the last screw out, shoves the window up.
	
	The wind BLASTS in, it's a hell of a spooky night out there.
	
	She leans out the window.  We lean with her.  The sidewalk is
	empty (we see it only from our vantage point inside the
	house).  She's one floor up.  To her right is the house's
	front stoop.
	
	She tosses the sledgehammer over, onto the stoop.  Climbs up
	onto the window ledge, and slithers out herself.
	
	We lean further, watch her as she edges along the ledge, hops
	down onto the stoop, and freezes, staring in horror --
	
	-- at the video camera that covers the front stoop.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	we see her staring straight up at the camera, clearly
	standing on the front stoop, outside the house, where she was
	specifically told not to go.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah sees the image of her on the stoop.  Raoul happens to
	be looking away at the moment, at the safe, but he starts to
	turn around, to look at the monitors again --
	
	-- and Sarah kicks him, hard, in the ass.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Hey!
	
	He turns, away from the monitors.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Sorry.  Can't control it sometimes.
	
	Raoul scowls at her.  Behind him --
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	Meg darts down the front steps and disappears from view on
	the monitor.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah sees her mother go.
	
	                     SARAH
	               (to Raoul)
	          Won't happen again.
	
	INT.  LIBRARY - NIGHT
	
	Still leaning out the window, we can see Meg from here as she
	reaches the sidewalk and runs up the front steps of the
	neighbor's house, which is contiguous.
	
	Straining to see (yet stay in the house), we see Meg all the
	way at the right edge of the frame, as she shifts the gun to
	the back of her pants and knocks on the neighbor's door,
	sledgehammer held slightly behind her leg.
	
	After a long moment, we hear the neighbor's front door open.
	The conversation begins.  The wind is gusting right in our
	faces, we can't make out the details, but the gist is clear --
	let me into your house, and don't as me a lot of questions.
	
	The NEIGHBOR -- and by the tone of the voice it sounds like
	an old woman -- is slow to respond, grumpy.
	
	Losing patience, Meg just pulls the Neighbor out of the way
	and shoves into the house.  The Neighbor stumbles out onto
	her front stoop, and we were right, it's an old lady in a
	nightgown, but she's no shrinking violet.  In fact, she's
	royally pissed off and not at all intimidated.
	
	                     NEIGHBOR
	          What the hell do you think you're
	          doing, young lady?!
	
	She storms back into her house, following Meg.  As both of
	them disappear from the frame, we move out of the library,
	into the foyer, and move along the common wall, the one
	shared with the neighbor's brownstone.
	
	From the other side of the wall, we can hear muffled voices,
	arguing, Meg and the Neighbor shouting at each other.
	
	We drift up, up the stairs, and hear the THUNDERING of
	footsteps on the stairs next door.  We keep pace with them,
	from inside this house.  We pass right through the floor --
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	-- and rise up out of the floor in the master bedroom, and
	now we can hear the conversation on the other side of the
	wall in here, the Neighbor's fearful, angry tones, Meg's
	firm, urgent declarations.
	
	We move with Meg, even though we can't see her, we know what
	she's doing, she's stepping off the paces on the other side
	of the wall.  We drift down that wall, fourteen steps, until
	we reach the metal door to the panic room, then we pass
	through that door --
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	-- and arrive inside the panic room, where Burnham is this
	close to getting the safe open, when all of a sudden --
	
	WHOMP.
	
	CRUNCH.
	
	Burnham and Raoul freeze, alarmed.  It's coming from the long
	wall, the shared wall.
	
	They look at each other.
	
	WHOMP.
	
	CRUNCH.
	
	They look at the wall.
	
	Somebody is on the other side, pounding like hell.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          The walls are steel, right?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Not that one.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          NOT THAT ONE?!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Hey man, it's the neighbor's house,
	          who breaks in through the neighbor's
	          house?!
	
	WHOMP!  CRUNCH!
	
	Louder.  Closer.  Burnham turns, SCREAMS at the wall.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE
	          NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!
	
	                     RAOUL
	          We've got the Kid!
	               (shouting at the wall)
	          WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck
	          is she thinking?!
	
	WHOMP!  CRUNCH!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          She's got your gun, that's what
	          she's thinking!  The FUCK you had to
	          bring a gun for?!
	
	Burnham throws himself back on the floor, goes back to work
	on the safe.  Fires up the drill again, it SCREAMS into the
	metal.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Almost there...
	
	The POUNDING keeps up from next door.  We hear sheetrock torn
	away on the far side.  Bricks, SCRAPING out of place.
	
	Sarah, in the corner, is energized, excited.  While Burnham
	and Raoul are distracted, she grabs the leather pouch, palms
	the three syringes that are left in there.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          ALMOST THERE...
	
	Finally, the door to the safe CRUNCHES in on one side,
	yielding to the drilling --
	
	-- at the very moment that the head of a sledgehammer CRASHES
	through the wall of the panic room.  Raoul grabs hold of
	Sarah, Burnham maintains his focus, throwing open the safe,
	revealing --
	
	-- nothing.
	
	CRUNCH!
	
	The sledgehammer head strikes again, opening up a hole about
	a foot across.  Light spills through from the other side, as
	well as the voice of the hysterical Neighbor.
	
	Raoul hurls Sarah against the far wall, leaps over to the
	side of the hole, and waits, poised above it.
	
	At the safe, Burnham doesn't lose his cool, just opens a
	false bottom in the safe, revealing a manila envelope.
	
	He snatches it up, RIPS it open, and his eyes dance as he
	holds up fourteen individual one million dollar U,S, Treasury
	Bearer Bonds.  He fans them out, eyes drinking from his
	Grail.
	
	BANG!
	
	A gunshot whizzes right through one of the bonds, setting it
	aflame before it SLAMS into the far wall, sending up a little
	cloud of plaster dust.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          JESUS!
	
	He whirls, sees an arm poking through the hole in the wall,
	gun extended.
	
	But Raoul is standing just above the hole, and already has
	his boot raised, over the hand.  He brings it down, a
	CRUNCHING blow that stomps right on Meg's wrist.
	
	Meg SCREAMS, loses her grip on the gun, and it CLATTERS into
	the space between the houses.
	
	BETWEEN THE WALLS,
	
	the gun falls into oblivion, the space between the walls,
	where no one can get to it.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Burnham shoves the loose bonds into his jacket.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I GOT THE MONEY, LET'S GO!!!
	
	Raoul grabs Sarah and turns, jabs the green button to open
	the door.
	
	Behind them, Meg SCREAMS in anger and wriggles through the
	opening.  Before she's even all the way through, she gets
	hold of Raoul's leg and pulls herself into the panic room,
	scraping and bloodying herself on the edges of the too-small
	hole.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          GO, LET'S GO, OUTTA HERE!!
	
	But Raoul is deep in a violent rage.  Still holding Sarah
	with one hand, he bends down, grabs Meg by the hair, and
	drags her toward the doorway.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
	
	He bolts out of the room, through the metal door, which is
	just finishing its slow crank open, its heavy spring coiling
	in the wall.
	
	Raoul drag Meg across the floor by the hair, right into the
	track of the open steel door.
	
	She looks up, sees the infrared safety beam over her head,
	and  realizes with horror what his intention is.
	
	Still with one arm holding Sarah, who is kicking and
	struggling viciously, Raoul holds Meg's head down on the
	floor, below the safety beam that would prevent the door from
	closing.  He reaches for the "close" button.
	
	Sarah raises her arm, stuffed with three syringes, and jabs
	them into Raoul's neck.  Raoul SCREAMS in pain.
	
	Meg manages to raise her head, breaking the beam.
	
	INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	On the stairwell, Burnham, stops, frozen, his face twitching
	with indecision.  He hears the murder taking place just above
	him.
	
	He runs down three steps.
	
	Stops again.
	
	Runs down the rest of the stairs.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Raoul stretches to push the red "close" button for the door,
	but he has to hold Meg's head down, out of the lower beam
	with one hand, all with Sarah savagely attacking him at the
	same time, and three syringes hanging out of his neck.
	
	Finally, he gets Meg's head all the way down, onto the floor.
	
	Looking up, Meg sees the red beam become complete again.
	
	Raoul jabs the button --
	
	-- just as Sarah throws her hand into the upper beam, the one
	at shoulder level.  Sarah's hand turns red, the beam is
	broken, the door will not close.
	
	Raoul ROARS in anger and twists violently, sending Sarah
	flying across the room.
	
	Meg strains, gets her head off the floor again, breaking the
	beam.  Raoul starts jamming the close button, over and over
	again, the beam completes, then breaks, completes, then
	breaks, never the button and the beam at the same time.
	
	But it can't go on forever.  Meg's tiring, she can't keep it
	up, her head trembles --
	
	-- and collapses onto the floor.
	
	The beam completes --
	
	-- Raoul SMACKS the red button --
	
	-- and Burnham appears on the other side of the door.  He
	reaches in, grabs hold of Raoul, to pull him off her, but
	Raoul loses his balance, falls forward --
	
	-- into the gap --
	
	-- and his head is crushed by the spring-loaded steel door
	that SLAMS forward just as Meg draws herself back.
	
	Meg falls across the panic room, grabs Sarah, and holds on
	tight.
	
	The door detects the obstruction and opens again, slowly.
	Raoul's body slumps to the floor, dead.
	
	Burnham stands there, looking down at Meg and Sarah.
	
	They stare at each other, wordless, their first face to face
	contact.  She sees the bonds protruding from his jacket.
	
	She just looks at him.  There will be no understanding here.
	
	He zips his jacket, turns, and hurries away.
	
	INT.  ENTRY FLOOR - NIGHT
	
	Burnham races down the steps, hurries to the entry door,
	throws it open --
	
	-- and finds a gun barrel pointed directly into his nose.  He
	blinks, tries to focus on whoever's on the other end of that
	gun.
	
	It's the Cop, the first Cop, the one who came to the door and
	was so suspicious of Meg.  The Cop looks down, sees blood
	smeared all over Burnham's jacket, sees more than enough to
	know his suspicions were correct.
	
	                     COP 1
	          Put your hands up.
	
	Burnham freezes, silhouetted in the doorway.  Wind and leaves
	blow into the house, a real gale outside.
	
	From behind Cop 1, MORE COPS SHOUT, all at once, must be a
	half dozen of 'em there, but Burnham can't see anything in
	the stinging light, and can't hear much either, over the
	ROARING wind.
	
	Burnham moves suddenly, flinging the door shut right in the
	Cop's face.  The door SLAMS hard, Burnham turns to run but
	doesn't get more than a few paces before three sharp GUNSHOTS
	CRACK through the door behind him.
	
	Brilliant white light spills through the bulletholes in the
	door, but it's not the light that gets you, it's the chunks
	of lead.  They rip through Burnham's back and come out his
	chest, a triangle pattern.
	
	Burnham stops, sags to his knees.  He reaches into his
	jacket, pulls out the loose stack of bonds.
	
	He fans them out, stares down at them, holds them like
	playing cards.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Monster hand.
	
	Behind him, the front door CRACKS open, half a dozen COPS
	appear and start SHOUTING, all at once.  Burnham tosses the
	bonds to the floor, the same gesture as folding a hand of
	poker.
	
	He GROANS and collapses, slowly, falling through the bonds,
	twisting as he goes down.  He SLAPS onto his back in the
	foyer as the wind gusts through the open door, scoops the
	bonds up off the floor, and blows them back into the house,
	as if they were never meant to leave.
	
	Burnham lies there on the floor, eyes open, staring up at the
	ceiling, looking at the bonds that swirl in the blast of air,
	suspended there, twisting and bucking and diving just over
	his head as he dies.
	
	                                             DISSOLVE TO:
	
	EXT.  CENTRAL PARK - GREAT LAWN - DAY
	
	The swirling bonds melt into swirling leaves, blowing in the
	air over Central Park on a crisp fall day.  The leaves float
	down, over the Great Lawn, that massive expanse of grass we
	saw in Meg's hallucination.
	
	But on a day like this the Great Lawn's full of people,
	throwing frisbees, playing football, lying there doing
	nothing.
	
	The leaves land on the grass next to Meg and Sarah, stretched
	out on a blanket, a newspaper spread in front of them, open
	to the ads.
	
	Meg is on her back, arms folded behind her head, staring up
	at the clouds.
	
	Sarah is intent on the paper, circling the occasional ad.
	
	                     SARAH
	          I mean, uptown is close to Dad's
	          place, but somebody at school said
	          the Village is really cool, so... I
	          don't know, it's so great to be
	          close to the park and everything...
	          What do you think, I mean, give me a
	          clue, here, where are we gonna live?
	
	Meg rolls over, props herself up on one elbow.  She seems
	years younger.  She looks at Sarah, reaches out, brushes her
	daughter's hair behind one ear.
	
	She smiles.  She is calm.
	
	Behind her, a flock of pigeons takes off, leaping into the
	clear autumn sky.
	
	                                                FADE OUT.
