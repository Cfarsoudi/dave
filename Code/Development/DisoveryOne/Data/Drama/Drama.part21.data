UN SINGE EN HIVER (1962)

                       D'après le roman de Antoine BLONDIN

                            Adaptation : François BOYER

                    Scénario : François BOYER & Henri VERNEUIL

                            Dialogues : Michel AUDIARD

                         
                         
                         
          LOGO DE « UFA COMACICO »
                         
          Le logo de « UFA Comacico » représente un éléphant de cirque
          devant un rideau de scène. Il lève la patte et la trompe, et il
          barrit.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - PLAGE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Plan d'une portion déserte de la plage. Une ponton en béton part
          de la plage et s'avance dans la mer. Un soldat allemand, en tenue
          de guerre, marche sur le ponton en direction de la mer.
                         
          Le générique apparaît en lettres blanches majuscules. Les noms des
          acteurs et des techniciens sont inscrits dans de petits cadres
          noirs, juste à la taille des noms. Ces cadres sont légèrement
          transparents, ce qui permet de voir le décor sous le cadre.
                         
          En bordure de plage, un escalier remonte de la plage. Un officier
          allemand remonte cet escalier. Suite du générique.
                         
          Plan d'ensemble de la plage avec un grand mur de pierre en premier
          plan. Au loin, un groupe de soldats allemands marchent le long de
          la mer, venant vers nous. Suite du générique.
                         
          Autre plan d'ensemble de la plage, vu de la promenade du bord de
          plage. Deux soldats allemands discutent devant une barrière
          amovible, qui barre le début de la route côtière. En bas de la
          rampe qui mène vers la plage, un motocycliste, sur sa moto,
          discute avec un autre soldat allemand à pied. La moto démarre et
          remonte vers la promenade. La moto sort du champ sur la droite.
          Suite du générique.
                         
          La moto roule sur la route côtière le long de la plage. En
          contrebas, le groupe de soldats continue à marcher le long de la
          mer. Au loin, sur la corniche, on aperçoit des maisons normandes
          typiques. La moto sort du champ vers la gauche, et les soldats
          vers la droite. Suite du générique.
                         
          Autre plan d'ensemble. Au premier plan, un soldat allemand monte
          la garde devant une barrière qui interdit l'accès à la plage. Sur
          la droite du soldat, le dos de la rangée de cabines de plage. Plus
          loin, deux autres soldats discutent devant une autre barrière.
          Dans le lointain, la corniche avec les maisons dessus. Une voiture
          longe les barrières, se dirigeant vers la corniche. Travelling sur
          la droite. Collé sur le côté de la première cabine de la rangée,
          nous voyons une affiche représentant des soldats allemands en
          uniforme de guerre. Sur l'affiche est écrit : « Avec tes camarades
          Européens, sous le signe SS, tu vaincras ! » Le travelling
          continue à se déplacer vers la droite. Devant la rangée de
          cabines, nous découvrons la promenade de bord de mer. Au fond,
          derrière la dernière cabine de la rangée, quatre soldats allemands
          montent la garde devant une barrière amovible. Le travelling
          s'arrête. Suite du générique.
                         
          Plan de demi-ensemble de la plage. Le groupe de soldats allemands
          marchent à la queue-leu-leu le long de la mer. Suite du générique.
                         
          Une jolie maison normande en bordure de mer. Elle est de taille
          assez imposante. Travelling sur la droite montrant l'entrée du
          village. Suite du générique.
                         
          Une ambulance, suivie d'une moto avec side-car et deux soldats à
          bord, entre dans le village par la route côtière. Sur le bord de
          la route, un panneau sur lequel est inscrit : « Tigreville ». Une
          moto double l'ambulance.
                         
          Contrechamp de la route côtière, qui monte vers le village. La
          moto roule vers nous, précédant l'ambulance, elle-même précédée
          par une autre moto avec side-car. Sur le bord de la route, un
          crucifix de grande hauteur. Suite du générique.
                         
          Plan général de la plage, vue du haut de la corniche, avec
          quelques toits de maison en premier plan. On aperçoit le groupe de
          soldats allemands, semblable, à cette distance, à un petit groupe
          de fourmis.
                         
          Fin du générique.
                         
          BAR « CHINOIS » - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Plan d'ensemble de l'escalier un peu rustique qui monte vers une
          grande bâtisse isolée au sommet d'une colline déserte, près de la
          mer et légèrement en dehors du village. Il s'agit d'un bar dit
          « chinois », en fait une maison « de rendez-vous ». Une jeune
          femme en imperméable monte l'escalier. A côté de l'escalier, une
          tour métallique supporte un bloc de sirènes.
          Contrechamp sur la femme qui monte l'escalier. En contrebas, des
          voitures militaires et des soldats allemands. La femme est
          Georgina, la « tenancière » du bar.
                         
          BAR « CHINOIS » - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Plan moyen sur la porte d'entrée qui s'ouvre et Georgina qui
          entre. Elle referme la porte derrière elle. Dans le petit couloir
          menant au bar, elle croise un officier allemand, qui la salue.
          Elle lui dit deux ou trois mots en allemand et lui sourit.
          L'officier sort et referme la porte derrière lui. Georgina
          remarque un casque colonial accroché sur un porte-manteau, fait
          une petite moue d'agacement et se dirige vers le bar en enlevant
          ses gants.
                         
          La décoration de la salle de bar est assez conventionnelle. Seuls
          quelques éléments donne une touche un peu asiatique à
          l'établissement, comme les lustres chinois qui pendent du plafond,
          ou la fresque qui couvre tout le mur derrière le bar.
                         
          Il n'y a que deux clients assis devant le bar : Albert Quentin et
          Lucien Esnault. Ils sont en train de boire, et sont déjà
          passablement éméchés. Les deux hommes paraissent dans la
          quarantaine. En fait, les deux acteurs, Jean Gabin et Paul
          Frankeur, ont été artificiellement rajeunis par les maquilleuses,
          de façon à paraître environ quinze ans plus jeunes que leur âge
          réel.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Matelot Esnault Lucien, veuillez armer la jonque, on
           appareille dans cinq minutes.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           C'est parti.
                         
          Il salue et se lève avec une certaine difficulté, traverse la
          pièce et se dirige, avec une démarche mal assurée, vers une jonque
          posée sur une étagère. Cette jonque est un modèle réduit de taille
          assez importante, mesurant environ 70 centimètres de la proue à la
          poupe. Il la prend et vient la poser sur le comptoir du bar.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Voilà !
                         
          Le « zinc » du comptoir forme un creux avec un rebord, tout autour
          du comptoir, d'environ cinq centimètres de hauteur. Albert prend
          un pichet publicitaire « Marie Brizard », et commence à verser de
          l'eau dans le creux du comptoir. Lucien prend un autre pichet et
          en fait autant de l'autre côté de la jonque. Georgina, qui vient
          d'enlever son imperméable, s'approche d'eux et ne semble pas ravie
          de voir ce qu'ils sont en train de faire.
                         
                          GEORGINA
           Albert !
                         
          Elle parle avec un léger accent étranger.
                         
                          GEORGINA
           Oh, je vous en prie, vous n'allez pas encore tout me
           saloper comme l'autre fois !
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Madame, le droit de navigation sur le Yang-Tsé-Kiang nous
           est formellement reconnu par la convention du 3 août 1885.
           Contesteriez-vous la chose ?
                         
          D'un revers de main, il fait tomber les trois bouteilles vide qui
          étaient sur le comptoir.
                         
                          GEORGINA
           Je ne conteste rien, je vous demande simplement de ne pas
           tout me casser comme l'autre jour.
                         
          Albert se retourne vers elle. Lucien aussi se retourne, mais plus
          lentement, et le regard un peu vague, alors qu'Albert, malgré
          qu'il soit visiblement ivre, garde le regard alerte.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ohhh mais pardon ! L'autre jour les hommes de Sun-Yat-Sen
           ont voulu jouer aux cons. Heureusement que j'ai brisé la
           révolte dans l'oeuf. Sans barbarie inutile d'ailleurs. On
           n'a coupé que les mauvaises têtes, le matelot Esnault peut
           témoigner.
                         
          Il le désigne du doigt, et Lucien lève une main hésitante comme
          pour prêter serment.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Sur l'honneur !
                         
          Albert contourne le comptoir.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Bon. Nous allons donc poursuivre notre mission
           civilisatrice.
                         
          Il est maintenant derrière le comptoir.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et d'abord je vais vous donner les dernières instructions
           de l'amiral Guépratte, rectifiées par le quartier-maître
           Quentin ici présent. Voilà... L'intention de l'amiral
           serait que nous percions un canal souterrain qui relirait
           le Wang-Hu au Yang-Tsé-Kiang !
                         
          Du doigt, il désigne le fleuve dessiné sur la fresque murale
          derrière lui.
                         
          Lucien essaie de répéter le mot « Yang-Tsé-Kiang », mais sa
          bouche, empâtée par l'alcool, a du mal à prononcer un mot aussi
          compliqué. Georgina le regarde en souriant.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Bon !
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Je ne vous apprendrai rien en vous rappelant que Wang-Hu
           veut dire dire fleuve jaune et Yang-Tse-Kiang, fleuve bleu.
           Je ne sais pas si vous vous rendez compte de l'aspect
           grandiose du mélange ? Un fleuve vert ! Vert comme les
           forêts, comme l'espérance. Matelot Esnault, nous allons
           repeindre l'Asie, lui donner une couleur tendre, nous
           allons installer le printemps dans ce pays de merde !
                         
          Il s'énerve un peu sur les derniers mots et désigne, de nouveau,
          la fresque murale du doigt.
                         
          Georgina sort de la salle du bar.
                         
                          GEORGINA
           Bon, je vois que vous êtes raisonnables, je vous laisse.
           J'ai des clients à servir, moi !
                         
          Albert sort de derrière le comptoir et crie :
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Hé !... Dites donc, l'indigène ! Un peu de tact, hein !
                         
          Il la suit dans la salle voisine.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Parlons d'autre chose... parce qu'on les connaît vos
           clients, la Wehrmacht polissonne et le Feldwebel
           escaladeur ! Hein !
                         
          Il s'est approché de l'escalier que Georgina a commencé à monter.
          Du doigt, il désigne le haut de l'escalier. Lucien l'a suivi.
          Gergina se retourne, un peu effrayée. De la main, elle lui fait
          signe de baisser le ton.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et puis merde, je vous raconterai plus rien, là !
                         
          Il retourne vers le bar.
                         
                          GEORGINA
           Chhhhut ! Albert ! Vous fâchez pas !
                         
          Albert revient un peu sur ses pas.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Vous fâchez pas, vous fâchez pas... Mais, nom de Dieu de
           bordel, je vous offre des rivières tricolores, des
           montagnes de fleurs et des temples sacrés, et vous me
           transformez tout ça en maison de passe ! Vous plantez votre
           Babylone normande dans ma mer de Chine. Alors... Matelot
           Esnault !
                         
          Lucien salue Albert.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Oui Chef !
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Reprenez le village ! Où sont les grenades que je les
           dégoupille ?
                         
          Il revient vers le bar, suivi par Lucien. Georgina, toujours
          plantée sur les premières marches de l'escalier, les regarde avec
          un peu d'inquiétude.
                         
          Albert ramasse une bouteille de vin sur une table. Lucien en
          ramasse une autre. Albert s'approche du bar et enlève le bouchon
          de sa bouteille avec les dents, comme s'il s'agissait de la
          goupille d'une grenade. Lucien en fait autant avec une autre
          bouteille. Les deux hommes s'apprêtent à lancer les bouteilles
          contre la fresque murale.
                         
           GEORGINA (criant en voix off)
           Monsieur Quentin !...
                         
          Elle s'approche des deux hommes, qui se retournent.
                         
                          GEORGINA
           Calmez-vous ! Je vous demande pardon.
                         
          Sa voix se fait suppliante et elle joint les mains. Albert enlève
          le bouchon qu'il avait gardé coincé entre les dents.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Une reddition ? Soit. La main de fer dans le gant de
           velours. Matelot, à vos pagaies !
                         
          Il se rassoit au comptoir, Lucien l'imite.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Oui Chef !
                         
          Ils versent chacun du vin dans leur verre à partir la bouteille
          qu'ils ont en main. Ils posent leurs bouteilles respectives, puis
          se mettent à boire. Lucien se lève avec difficulté, et, en
          titubant, tend les mains vers la jonque sur le comptoir. Albert
          l'observe.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Attention aux roches ! Et surtout attention aux mirages !
           Le Yang-Tsé-Kiang n'est pas un fleuve, c'est une avenue,
           une avenue de cinq milles kilomètres qui dégringole du
           Tibet pour finir dans la mer jaune...
                         
          Albert a soulevé la jonque du bar avec délicatesse et lenteur.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           ... avec des jonques et puis des sampans de chaque côté.
           Puis au milieu, il y a des... des tourbillons d'îles
           flottantes avec des orchidées hautes comme les arbres. Le
           Yang-Tsé-Kiang, camarade, c'est des millions de mètres
           cubes d'or et de fleurs qui descendent vers Nankin. Puis
           avec, tout le long, des villes-pontons où on peut tout
           acheter... des... alcool de riz... la religion, puis les
           garces et l'opium.
                         
          Il se tourne vers Georgina, toujours debout derrière eux. Lucien
          repose la jonque sur le comptoir et se retourne aussi.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Je peux vous affirmer, tenancière, que le fusilier des
           marins a été longtemps l'élément décoratif des maisons de
           thé. En ce temps-là, on savait rire ! « Elle s'était mis
           sur la paille pour un maquereau roux et rose, c'était un
           juif qui sentait l'ail ! Il l'avait, venant de Formose,
           tiré d'un bordel de Shangaï. »
                         
          Georgina a l'air ému.
                         
                          GEORGINA
           Oh, c'est beau !
                         
          Albert commence lentement à se diriger vers la sortie.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           C'est pas de moi ! J'ai des vapes comme ça qui me
           reviennent quand je descends le fleuve !
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Je croyais que c'était une avenue ?
                         
          Albert a mis une cigarette entre ses lèvres. Il écarte les bras
          avec une moue dubitative. Puis il prend un air pensif.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           On sait pas ! C'est peut-être un rêve qui se jette dans la
           mer.
                         
          On entend la sirène d'alerte qui se met en marche.
                         
          BAR « CHINOIS » - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Plan rapproché sur la sirène située à côté du bar « chinois ».
          Travelling à droite, montrant la mer dans le lointain. On entend
          d'autres sirènes qui sonnent aussi.
                         
          Plan général du ciel au-dessus de Tigreville. Une escadrille
          d'avions volent dans le ciel.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - PLAGE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Une grosse « jeep » allemande vient de s'arrêter au bord de la
          plage. Des soldats armés en descendent rapidement, sous les ordres
          d'un officier.
                         
                          OFFICIER ALLEMAND
           Schnell !...
                         
          Les soldats et l'officier descendent en courant vers la plage.
          D'autres officiers descendent derrière eux.
                         
          BAR « CHINOIS » - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Plan en contre-plongée de l'escalier. Une femme en robe de
          chambre, puis un officier allemand, sortent d'une chambre sur le
          palier. L'officier finit d'enfiler ses bottes. D'autres filles en
          robe de chambre et d'autres officiers sortent de chambres
          voisines, et commencent à descendre l'escalier. On entend les
          officiers parler allemand sur un ton assez énervé. Les filles
          aussi semblent énervées, mais le brouhaha ambiant fait que l'on
          peut à peine distinguer leurs paroles.
                         
                          UNE FILLE
           Hé ! Attendez-moi !
                         
          Plan rapproché sur l'arrière des marches de l'escalier, à travers
          lesquelles on voit les jambes des filles et des officiers qui
          descendent rapidement, et en arrière-plan, le visage un peu ahuri
          de Lucien, et celui, plus moqueur d'Albert.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Achtung, monsieur ! Achtung !
                         
          Georgina, venant du bar, vient vers eux en courant.
                         
                          GEORGINA
           Allez ! Allez ! Descendez dans la cave.
                         
          Albert fait un geste évasif, ramasse son casque colonial accroché
          au porte-manteau, et se dirige tranquillement vers la sortie,
          suivi de Lucien.
                         
          La porte est restée ouverte après le départ des officiers
          allemands, et Albert sort dehors, suivi de Lucien.
          BAR « CHINOIS » - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Albert et Lucien s'arrête devant l'entrée du bar, et regardent
          autour d'eux. On entend les moteurs des avions alliés. Derrière
          eux, on voit se fermer la porte du bar. Les deux hommes lèvent la
          tête.
                         
          Contrechamp sur le ciel au-dessus d'eux, dans lequel on voit trois
          avions voler côte à côte.
                         
          Retour sur les deux hommes. Derrière eux, un officier allemand
          retardataire sort en courant du bar.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Ils bombardent Le Havre.
                         
          Dans le ciel, un avion largue des bombes.
                         
          Retour sur les deux hommes.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Le Havre ! Le Havre ! T'es complètement bourré ! Le Havre,
           c'est de l'autre côté. Ça nous tombe sur la gueule, oui !
                         
          Il s'éloigne rapidement. Lucien le suit.
                         
          Ils s'arrêtent un peu plus loin sur la colline qui surplombe la
          mer. Albert met sa main en visière pour regarder le ciel.
                         
          Dans le ciel, un autre avion largue des bombes.
                         
          Retour sur les deux hommes. Albert fait signe à Lucien de
          s'allonger par terre.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Couchez-vous !
                         
          Ils s'aplatissent par terre, juste au moment où une bombe tombe
          non loin d'eux.
                         
          Plan rapproché sur les deux hommes allongés dans l'herbe,
          environnés d'une épaisse fumée. Lucien a les mains sur la tête.
                         
          Dans le ciel, un autre avion passe rapidement en larguant des
          bombes.
                         
          Retour sur la colline. Une autre bombe tombe près du bar
          « chinois ».
                         
          Plan rapproché sur les deux hommes. La fumée se dissipe un peu.
          Lucien est couvert d'herbe et de branchages. Albert relève
          lentement la tête. On entend les rafales des mitrailleuses anti-
          aériennes. Puis d'autres bruits mêlés de bombes, de coups de canon
          et de tir de DCA. Les deux hommes se relèvent et s'éloignent.
                         
          Dans le ciel, un autre avion largue des bombes.
                         
          Plan moyen sur Albert et Lucien, qui se cachent derrière un talus,
          toujours sur la colline. On voit la plage en contrebas, avec les
          bombes qui explosent. Les deux hommes, allongés sur le ventre, se
          couvrent la tête de leurs mains.
                         
          Dans le ciel, deux avions larguent des bombes.
                         
          Retour sur Albert et Lucien, qui n'ont pas bougé de place. Les
          bombes continuent à éclater autour d'eux sur le flanc de la
          colline.
                         
          Plan moyen en contre-plongée du bar « chinois ». Une bombe éclate
          tout près de lui.
                         
          Plan rapproché d'Albert et Lucien, que l'on aperçoit au milieu
          d'une épaisse fumée. Ils se redressent lentement.
                         
          Plan général de la plage et de ses abords, en contrebas de la
          colline. La DCA allemande tire en continu.
                         
          Plan rapproché sur Lucien, qui relève la tête vers le ciel. Albert
          l'imite.
                         
          Dans le ciel, un avion vole au milieu des parachutes qui
          descendent lentement vers le sol.
                         
          Retour sur Albert et Lucien, qui regardent vers la plage.
                         
          Plan d'ensemble des canons anti-aériens, qui tirent vers le ciel.
                         
          Dans le ciel, un avion prend un long virage. Il largue un
          parachute.
                         
          Plan rapproché d'Albert et Lucien, qui se protègent la tête de
          leurs mains. Albert rampe lentement vers le bas et passe derrière
          Lucien.
                         
          Plan rapproché d'Albert caché dans un creux d'herbes. Lucien
          descend vers lui. Ils regardent tous deux vers le ciel.
                         
          Dans le ciel, une imposante escadrille d'avions approche de la
          côte.
                         
          Retour sur les deux hommes. Albert semble réfléchir.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Dis donc, il serait peut-être temps d'aller retrouver nos
           bonnes femmes. Elles doivent s'inquiéter.
                         
          Il se relève.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Y aurait comme de quoi.
                         
          Il se lève à son tour.
                         
          A quatre pattes, les deux hommes remontent vers le chemin. Un
          mouvement de caméra permet de découvrir, devant eux, une petite
          maison, autour de laquelle les bombes explosent. Devant la maison,
          est garé un véhicule militaire. Une moto s'éloigne de la maison.
          Lucien et Albert descendent lentement vers le terre-plein autour
          de la maison. On entend une ambulance. Lucien et Albert sont
          maintenant sur le terre-plein et marchent tranquillement vers la
          maison.

          l'église (?), et d'où sortent des flammes. Derrière ce
          « clocher », un escalier qui descend vers le centre ville. Albert
          et Lucien descendent l'escalier.

          Plan de demi-ensemble d'une rue jonchée de débris et de deux
          voitures en flamme. Derrière ces voitures, le bas d'un escalier
          sur lequel Albert et Lucien apparaissent. Ils marchent entre les
          deux voitures en flamme. Bruit d'une grosse explosion.

          d'énorme gerbes d'eau.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - RUES BOMBARDÉES - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Albert continue sa progression entre les deux voitures en flamme.
          Lucien le suit à une certaine distance.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Voilà que ça repart !
                         
          Albert se tourne vers lui.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et puisque je te dis que c'est rien.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           C'est rien, c'est rien...
          Albert fait un geste autoritaire des deux bras.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Rien !
                         
          Il repart, suivi de Lucien.
                         
          Plan d'ensemble des ruines d'une maison. Les deux hommes circulent
          entre ces ruines. Derrière eux, un bâtiment de trois étages en
          flammes. On entend des tirs de mitrailleuse. Albert se retourne
          vers Lucien, qui tripote sa cravate.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ben, qu'est-ce que tu fous avec ta cravate ?
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Je veux pas mourir débraillé.
                         
          Il rejoint Albert.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oui, et bien tu feras ta toilette de mort plus tard. Allez,
           magne-toi.
                         
          Il reprend sa marche, et descend vers une autre maison en ruines,
          suivi de Lucien. Ils atteignent une zone où une épaisse fumée
          permet à peine de les distinguer

          Plan d'ensemble d'une esplanade, sur laquelle se trouvent deux
          chars allemands abandonnés. Albert et Lucien traversent cette
          esplanade. A l'extrémité de l'esplanade, ils montent une rampe qui
          rejoint des bâtiments. Des bombes tombent autour des chars
          abandonnés.
                         
          Dans le ciel, une escadrille d'avion est doublée par une autre
          escadrille plus rapide.
                         
          Une bombe explose sur le sol.
                         
          Dans le ciel, trois avions piquent vers le sol.

          épaisse fumée. Albert lève les yeux vers le ciel.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh, merde !
                         
          Il fait semblant de tirer vers le ciel avec une mitraillette
          imaginaire.
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta !...
                         
          Dans le ciel, un avion pique vers le sol.
                         
          Retour sur Albert qui s'est remis en marche. Lucien regarde
          l'avion. On entend son moteur s'emballer.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Oh !... Albert !
                         
          Mais Albert s'est remis en marche et est déjà loin devant Lucien.
                         
          Plan, dans le ciel, de l'avion qui descend en piqué et s'écrase en
          mer.
                         
          Retour sur Lucien qui court après Albert.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Albert !
                         
          Il marche en tendant le bras en arrière, car, dans son délire
          d'ivrogne, il semble persuadé que c'est Albert, avec sa
          mitraillette imaginaire, qui a descendu l'avion !
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Oh !... Albert !
                         
          Plan d'ensemble d'une rue en ruines, plongée dans une épaisse
          fumée, et au milieu de laquelle on distingue à peine les deux
          silhouettes d'Albert et de Lucien. Des gens courent autour d'eux
          pour aller se mettre à l'abri.
                         
          Fondu enchaîné.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - RUE HÔTEL STELLA - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Plus tard. La nuit est tombée.
                         
          Plan rapproché en contre-plongée sur l'angle de deux rues. Une
          plaque, apposée au premier étage du mur de la maison, indique le
          nom de la rue : « Rue du Maréchal Pétain ».
                         
          La caméra descend au niveau du sol, et montre d'autres pancartes,
          installées au niveau du rez-de-chaussée à l'angle de la rue, et
          qui donnent des indications en allemand. Un groupe de soldats
          allemands casqués courent dans la rue, au milieu des flammes. Il
          passent devant une maison avec une grande vitrine. Au-dessus de
          cette vitrine, une inscription : « Hôtel Stella ».
                         
          Gros plan en contre-plongée d'une enseigne accrochée au mur de
          cette maison, et sur laquelle on peut lire, en lettres blanches
          sur fond noir : « Hotel Stella - Pension - Restaurant - Garage ».
                         
          Retour au niveau de la rue, dans laquelle circulent des motos de
          l'armée allemande. Derrière le passage des motards, un pan de
          maison s'écroule en flammes. Un homme à la jambe bandée traverse
          la rue en s'aidant de deux béquilles. Des soldats allemands
          casqués courent dans le sens inverse du premier groupe. On entend
          la voix d'Albert chanter à tue-tête :
           ALBERT QUENTIN (voix off)
           It's a long way to Tipperary...
                         
          Un soupirail vu à travers les jambes des soldats qui courent.
          Albert passe la tête par le soupirail et chante. Derrière lui, on
          distingue sa femme Suzanne.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           It's a long way to go...
                         
          Zoom avant sur le soupirail. On voit plus distinctement Albert
          accroché des deux mains aux barreaux du soupirail et continuant à
          chanter.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           It's a long way to Tipperary... Et good-bye Piccadilly !...
                         
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - CAVE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Plan d'ensemble d'une cave voûtée, dont le plafond est supporté
          par de gros piliers de briques. Sur des étagères sont alignées de
          nombreuses bouteilles de vins. Des toiles d'araignées pendent du
          plafond. Au fond de la cave, debout devant le soupirail, Albert
          continue à chanter.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           It's a long way to gooo !...
                         
          Il revient vers l'intérieur de la cave, où sa femme, Suzanne, est
          assise.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Aux chiottes, les teutons !... Bande de mange-merde !
                         
          Il se sert un verre de vin, à partir d'une bouteille posée sur un
          tonneau.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Arrête, Albert ! Tu vas nous faire fusiller !
                         
          Par le soupirail ouvert, on voit les jambes des gens qui circulent
          dans la rue.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et pas de bandeau sur les yeux, je commanderai le peloton
           moi-même, comme le Maréchal Ney !
                         
          Il pointe le doigt vers son coeur.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Droit au coeur, messieurs.
                         
          Suzanne reste assise, enveloppée dans un grand châle de laine.
          Elle semble mal à son aise.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Si tu crois que c'est le moment de faire le zouave.
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Je me demande, madame, ce que les Zouaves viennent faire
           la-dedans ! Quartier-maître Quentin, du Corps
           Expéditionnaire d'Extrême-Orient... Garde à vous ! Envoyez
           les couleurs !
                         
          Il porte une bouteille à ses lèvres comme s'il s'agissait d'une
          trompette, et chante la sonnerie de l'envoi des couleurs. Suzanne
          le regarde en haussant les épaules.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ta-ta, tagada-dein-dein, ta-ta, tarrrrein-tein, ta-ta,
           tarra-da-da, ta-ta, tarrein-tein.
                         
          Il baisse sa bouteille.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Repos !
                         
          Une bombe a dû tomber très près de chez eux, car le bruit est plus
          fort, les bouteilles sont agitées sur leurs étagères, et une pluie
          de plâtre tombe du plafond. Albert sursaute et se tourne vers la
          pluie de plâtre.
                         
          Une autre bombe tombe près de chez eux. Et cette fois-ci, c'est
          derrière Suzanne que tombe la pluie de plâtre.
                         
          Une autre bombe éclate. Deux pluies de plâtre en deux endroits
          différents de la cave. Des bouteilles tombent par terre et se
          brisent.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           La rigolade s'organise.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Ce matin, chez le boucher, on disait que les Allemands
           allaient tout faire sauter avant de partir.
                         
          Albert lève la main d'un geste impérial.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mais c'est leur droit. Moi, je dis que le soldat en fuite a
           droit à certaines compensations récréatives.
                         
          Il ramasse son verre sur le tonneau, et se dirige vers Suzanne.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Personnellement, je me suis tapé de sévères courettes, je
           connais la question.
                         
          Il s'assoit sur un casier à bouteilles.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Si tu buvais moins, t'aurais peur comme tout le monde.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ouais, et bien si je buvais moins, je serais un autre
           homme.
                         
          Il débouche la bouteille, qui lui avait servi de trompette
          improvisée, et remplit son verre.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et j'y tiens pas.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Si tu trouves ça intelligent de mourir saoul !... Je te
           jures, ça fera bonne impression en ville. Tu sais ce qu'on
           dira ?
                         
          Il se lève et regarde sa femme avec un air important.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mourir saoul, c'est mourir debout, et je me fous des
           racontars ! L'histoire jugera, madame, et d'ailleurs, je ne
           vois pas pourquoi je boirais moins aujourd'hui...
                         
          Il porte le verre à ses lèvres, mais le redescend aussitôt, car
          une grosse pluie de plâtre s'abat derrière lui. Il s'éloigne en
                         CRIANT :
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ils vont tout foutre en l'air, ces cons-là !
                         
          Une autre pluie de plâtre s'abat sur l'escalier.
                         
          Suzanne se lève d'un bond. Elle bute sur un tonneau et se retourne
          au moment où un autre pluie de plâtre s'abat derrière elle.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - RUE HÔTEL STELLA - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Dans la rue, trois soldats en armes courent dans tous les sens.
          L'un d'eux crie quelque chose en allemand, mais une bombe tombe
          dans la rue et les tue tous les trois.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - CAVE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Albert boit tranquillement son verre au milieu du vacarme et du
          plâtre qui continue à tomber du plafond. Suzanne se précipite sur
          lui et le prend par le bras. Elle semble effrayée.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Albert, j'ai peur !
                         
          Il la regarde longuement avant de répondre :
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Bois !
                         
          Un autre bruit de bombe, et toute la vaisselle de service en métal
          de l'hôtel dégringole dans l'escalier de la cave, accompagnée des
          valises dans lesquelles elle était rangée.
                         
          La lampe d'éclairage de la cave se balance sur son fil, puis
          s'éteint.
                         
          Dans la pénombre, où l'on ne distingue plus que la lumière de la
          rue filtrant par la lucarne, on entend Albert crier : « Oh ! »,
          puis Suzanne se met à sangloter tout en toussant à cause de la
          poussière. On aperçoit la lueur d'une bougie qu'Albert vient
          d'allumer au fond de la cave. Les sanglots de Suzanne sont devenus
          presque hystériques.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ben, Suzanne, où que t'es, ma Suzanne ?... Ben,
           Suzanne !... Hein ?
                         
          Il se rapproche de l'endroit d'où proviennent les sanglots et la
          toux de Suzanne.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ah !...
                         
          Il vient de la repérer, assise près d'une étagère, et sanglotant
          toutes les larmes de son corps.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Écoute-moi bien, ma Suzanne...
                         
          Suzanne relève la tête et le regarde.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ce que je vais te dire, c'est sérieux, et puis... c'est
           même grave. Si on s'en sort, hein... si la maison tient
           debout, et puis, si, un jour, je peux rallumer l'enseigne
           qui est au-dessus de la porte... et bien, je te jure de ne
           plus toucher un verre... Jamais...
                         
          Les sanglots de Suzanne se sont arrêtés. Elle regarde son mari,
          semblant, malgré elle, assez impressionnée par ce discours et
          cette gravité inhabituels.
                         
          Albert se sert un grand verre de vin à la lumière de la bougie. Il
          pose la bouteille sur le tonneau, et lève son verre en direction
          de Suzanne.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Tiens, regarde. C'est peut-être le dernier.
                         
          Il porte le verre à ses lèvres et le boit lentement.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - RUE HÔTEL STELLA - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Même plan rapproché que précédemment : contre-plongée du premier
          étage de l'immeuble au coin de la rue près de l'hôtel, avec la
          plaque indiquant le nom de la rue, qui est toujours : « Rue du
          Maréchal Pétain ».
                         
          Fondu au noir.
                         
          Le même plan réapparait, mais, cette fois-ci, le nom de la rue est
          devenu : « Rue du Général de Gaulle » !
                         
          La caméra descend au niveau de la rue, qui est très calme
          maintenant. Toutes les devantures des magasins ont été réparées,
          les impacts de bombe sur la chaussée ont été bouchés. Par contre,
          il pleut ! Un homme s'éloigne, marchant à grandes enjambées sous
          la pluie.
                         
          Plan rapproché en contre-plongée de l'enseigne de l'hôtel. Elle
          est maintenant rédigée en lettres noires sur fond blanc, mais le
          même texte est toujours inscrit : « Hôtel Stella - Pension -
          Restaurant - Garage ». Et elle est éclairée par une grosse
          ampoule. Albert a donc pu rallumer son enseigne, comme il le
          souhaitait.
                         
          DEAUVILLE - PLACE DE LA GARE - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Plan d'ensemble de la place de la gare de Deauville, qui est
          déserte. Seul, une DS Citroën est garée sur le parking, avec
          l'enseigne « Taxi » fixée sur le toit.
                         
          Plan moyen de l'entrée de la gare. Un homme jeune, dans la
          trentaine, sort de la gare, portant une valise. Il s'agit de
          Gabriel Fouquet. Il est engoncé dans son imperméable. Il regarde
          la pluie qui tombe avec une grimace de mécontentement. Il relève
          son col et se dirige vers le parking.
                         
          Il s'approche du taxi garé au milieu du parking. Il n'y a personne
          dans la voiture. Il pose sa valise par terre, ouvre la porte du
          conducteur et actionne le klaxon à plusieurs reprises.
          Plan moyen du « Café de la Gare ». Par les vitres du café, on voit
          un homme s'éloigner du comptoir et ouvrir la porte d'entrée. Il
          referme la porte et court vers son taxi.
                         
           LE CHAUFFEUR DE TAXI
           Voilà ! Voilà !
                         
          Il s'approche de sa voiture.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je vais à Tigreville.
                         
           LE CHAUFFEUR DE TAXI
           Montez !
                         
          Gabriel prend sa valise et ouvre la porte arrière. Le chauffeur
          ouvre sa portière avant.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           C'est loin ?
                         
           LE CHAUFFEUR DE TAXI
           Oh non... Six kilomètres.
                         
          Les deux hommes montent dans la voiture, qui démarre et sort du
          parking.
                         
          TAXI - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Gabriel s'est assis, non pas derrière le chauffeur, mais sur le
          siège voisin, de façon à pouvoir discuter plus facilement. Il
          regarde la route sombre et pluvieuse qui défile par les vitres du
          taxi, puis les premières maisons de Tigreville.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Vous croyez qu'on trouvera un hôtel ouvert dans le coin ?
                         
           LE CHAUFFEUR DE TAXI
           Oh... c'est pas la saison. Enfin, je vais vous montrer ce
           qui nous reste.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Le taxi passe devant le panneau qui indique l'entrée de
          Tigreville, et enfile la route qui monte vers le centre ville.
                         
          TAXI - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
           LE CHAUFFEUR DE TAXI
           Ça, en temps normal, c'est les Roches Noires. C'est ce
           qu'il y a de mieux, hein.
                         
          Par les vitres du taxi, on aperçoit l'hôtel des Roches Noires,
          dont tous les volets sont fermés.
                         
           LE CHAUFFEUR DE TAXI
           Seulement, ils ferment le quinze septembre. J'ai pas de
           conseil à vous donner, mais vous auriez mieux fait de
           rester à Deauville. D'ailleurs, y a encore des hôtels bien.
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           A Cannes aussi, ou à Palma. Malheureusement, j'ai rien à y
           faire.
                         
           LE CHAUFFEUR DE TAXI
           Moi, je vous disais ça, hein...
                         
          TIGREVILLE - RUE HÔTEL STELLA - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Le taxi s'approche de l'hôtel Stella, et s'arrête devant.
                         
          Le chauffeur se glisse sur le siège passager et ouvre la portière.
          Gabriel baisse sa vitre.
                         
           LE CHAUFFEUR DE TAXI
           Y a ça, chez Quentin...
                         
          Plan en contre-plongée de l'enseigne de l'hôtel, qui n'est plus
          éclairée.
                         
          Retour sur le taxi.
                         
           LE CHAUFFEUR DE TAXI
           C'est ouvert, mais je vous préviens, vous allez pas vous
           marrer.
                         
          Gabriel inspecte la devanture de l'hôtel.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je suis pas venu pour me marrer.
                         
           LE CHAUFFEUR DE TAXI
           Ah bon...
                         
          Le chauffeur sort de son taxi par la porte passager et la referme.
          Il lève la tête vers les fenêtres du premier étage, et appelle :
                         
           LE CHAUFFEUR DE TAXI
           Quentin !... Albert !... Albert !...
                         
          Plan, en contre-plongée, d'une fenêtre qui s'allume au premier
          étage, à côté de l'enseigne. La fenêtre s'ouvre, et Albert
          apparaît en pyjama rayé. L'acteur Jean Gabin a maintenant repris
          son aspect normal et ses cheveux blancs, et paraît donc son âge
          réel.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
                         
           LE CHAUFFEUR DE TAXI (voix off)
           Un client...
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Je descends.
                         
          Il rentre dans sa chambre.
                         
          Retour sur le taxi. Le chauffeur ouvre la porte de Gabriel, qui
          sort sa valise, que le chauffeur lui prend des mains. Puis Gabriel
          lui-même sort du taxi.
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je vous dois combien ?
                         
           LE CHAUFFEUR DE TAXI
           Quinze cents francs pour la course.
                         
          Gabriel sort des billets de sa poche.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Et cinq cents pour la conversation. Gardez tout.
                         
          Il met l'argent dans la main du chauffeur.
                         
           LE CHAUFFEUR DE TAXI
           Merci.
                         
          Ils se dirigent tous les deux vers la porte de l'hôtel.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - VESTIBULE DE RÉCEPTION - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Albert, qui a enfilé un blouson par-dessus son pyjama, se dirige
          vers la porte d'entrée. A sa gauche, le comptoir de la réception.
          Il ouvre la porte.
                         
           LE CHAUFFEUR DE TAXI
           Bonsoir, Albert.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Bonsoir.
                         
          Le chauffeur donne sa valise à Gabriel, et retourne vers son taxi.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Vous avez une chambre ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh la ! J'en ai quatorze ! Entrez, monsieur.
          Gabriel entre dans l'hôtel. Albert referme la porte derrière lui.
          Gabriel regarde le comptoir de réception. On entend sonner un
          carillon. Albert fait le tour du comptoir. Sur le mur, derrière le
          comptoir, l'horloge marque 10h30, et, sur le mur de côté, le
          calendrier indique : « jeudi 28 octobre ». Albert décroche une
          clef sur le tableau sous l'horloge. Il prend une fiche sur le
          comptoir, et refait le tour du comptoir.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Tenez, si vous voulez me suivre.
                         
          Il s'éloigne du comptoir et Gabriel le suit.
                         
          Plan en plongée vu du haut de l'escalier. Albert commence à
          monter, suivi de Gabriel.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Vous savez, si vous êtes venu pour les bains de mer, j'aime
           mieux vous dire que la saison est terminée.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire, la saison ? Les paysans disent
           qu'il y en a plus, de saison. Vous en avez encore une,
           vous ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Boh !... Du premier au quinze août, dans les années
           exceptionnelles.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - COULOIR PREMIER ÉTAGE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Ils sont arrivés au premier étage. Albert s'avance dans le
          couloir.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Vous gardez la chambre plusieurs jours ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je sais pas.
                         
          Albert s'arrête devant une porte et introduit la clef dans la
          serrure.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - CHAMBRE GABRIEL - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          La porte s'ouvre et Albert entre le premier.
                         
          La chambre est assez conventionnellement celle d'un hôtel de
          province de l'époque. Papier à grosses fleurs sur les murs, cadre
          avec une photo de voilier, un lavabo avec une tablette de verre et
          un miroir au-dessus, un lit à structure métallique, une table de
          nuit avec une lampe de chevet, une commode, un fauteuil en bois
          avec un coussin dessus, une table recouverte d'une nappe à motif
          moderne avec un cendrier publicitaire posé dessus.
                         
          Gabriel suit Albert et jette un rapide regard circulaire autour de
          lui.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Voilà...
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Ça m'a l'air parfait.
                         
          Il pose sa valise au pied du lit.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Je vous laisse votre fiche, vous la remplirez demain. Vous
           avez besoin de quelque chose ?
                         
          Albert a posé la fiche sur la table. Gabriel commence à
          déboutonner son imperméable.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Euh... Qu'est-ce qu'on peut boire à cette heure-ci ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh ben...Vittel, Evian, Perrier...
                         
          Gabriel finit d'enlever son imperméable.
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Oh... Tout compte fait, j'ai pas soif.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et ben, comme vous voudrez. Voilà...
                         
          Albert se dirige vers la porte.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Bonne nuit, monsieur.
                         
          Albert sort et referme la porte derrière lui. Gabriel pose son
          imperméable sur le bout du lit, et regarde autour de lui. Il met
          les mains dans ses poches, et s'adosse sur le lit.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - CHAMBRE ALBERT - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          La chambre d'Albert et Suzanne ne ressemble pas aux autres
          chambres de l'hôtel. Elle est moins impersonnelle, avec des
          meubles plus jolis et de nombreux vases et objet disposés dessus.
                         
          Albert entre et referme la porte derrière lui. On ne voit pas
          encore Suzanne, mais on devine qu'elle est toujours au lit, dont
          on aperçoit le pied à droite du champ.
                         
           SUZANNE QUENTIN (voix off venant du lit)
           Qui est-ce ?
                         
          Albert enlève son blouson, et s'avance dans la chambre, suivi par
          la caméra.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Un client.
                         
          On découvre Suzanne à moitié assise dans le lit. Elle a changé de
          coiffure et a maintenant les cheveux coupés courts, alors qu'elle
          les portait longs pendant la guerre.
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Je m'en doute. Il t'a rien dit ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ben, qu'est-ce que tu voulais qu'il me dise ? Il m'a
           demandé une chambre, je lui ai donné le huit.
                         
          Il pose son blouson sur un fauteuil.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Avoue que c'est quand même une drôle d'heure pour arriver,
           surtout de ce temps-là.
                         
          Albert s'assoit sur le lit et enlève ses pantoufles.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh... les voyageurs, c'est fait pour voyager, et puis le
           temps n'a rien à voir là-dedans.
                         
          Il se glisse sous les draps. Suzanne en fait de même.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Allez...
                         
          Il ramasse un bonbon dans une coupelle sur la table de nuit et le
          met dans sa bouche. Il se gratte la tête, puis éteint sa lampe de
          chevet. Suzanne a les yeux grand ouvert, et soudain, elle tourne
          la tête et tend l'oreille. On entend une porte qui se ferme, puis
          des bruits de parquet qui grince. Suzanne se redresse dans son
          lit. Albert ne bouge pas, un bras replié au-dessus de sa tête.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Écoute !...
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Quoi ?
                         
          Plan rapproché sur la porte de la chambre. On entend quelqu'un qui
          passe derrière la porte dans le couloir.
                         
          Suzanne se tourne vers Albert.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Tu vas tout de même pas me dire que tu trouves ça naturel ?
                         
          Albert n'a toujours pas bougé.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Qu'est-ce qu'il y a de surnaturel à chercher les waters ?
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Albert !...
                         
          Elle sort précipitamment du lit, et ramasse sa robe de chambre.
          Albert allume posément sa lampe de chevet.
                         
          Suzanne arrive près de la porte en finissant d'enfiler sa robe de
          chambre. Elle entr'ouvre doucement la porte et regarde dans le
          couloir. Elle fait signe à Albert de venir près d'elle.
          Albert se lève lentement, sort du lit, enfile ses pantoufles et
          rejoint Suzanne près de la porte. Il ouvre la porte en grand et
          sort dans le couloir. Suzanne le suit.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - COULOIR PREMIER ÉTAGE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          La caméra suit Albert et Suzanne dans le couloir. Ils arrivent à
          l'escalier. En contrebas, dans le hall de réception, on voit
          Gabriel, qui descend les dernières marches. Il regarde autour de
          lui. Il ouvre à deux battants les portes d'un placard, mais rien,
          dans ce placard, ne semble l'intéresser et il le referme. Il
          trouve un interrupteur et allume la lumière de la salle à manger.
          Il pénètre dans la salle à manger que l'on voit à travers le mur
          vitré qui la sépare du hall de réception. Albert et Suzanne
          s'accoudent sur la rampe pour mieux l'observer. Gabriel s'approche
          d'un buffet, dont il ouvre les portes. Il regarde à l'intérieur et
          referme le buffet.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - VESTIBULE DE RÉCEPTION - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Gabriel revient vers le hall de réception, et éteint la lumière
          avant de sortir. Une autre lumière s'allume au premier étage.
          Gabriel se retourne vers Albert et Suzanne, que l'on voit en
          contre-plongée en haut de l'escalier.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Vous cherchez quelque chose ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           La porte.
                         
          Albert montre quelque chose du doigt derrière Gabriel.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Droit devant vous.
                         
          Gabriel se retourne et se dirige vers la porte d'entrée.
                         
           ALBERT QUENTIN (voix off)
           Soyez aimable de la refermer, hein ?
                         
          Gabriel ouvre la porte, sort dans la rue, et referme la porte
          derrière lui.
                         
          Retour à la contre-plongée sur Albert et Suzanne, en haut de
          l'escalier. Albert pénètre dans le couloir, suivi de Suzanne.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - CHAMBRE ALBERT - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Par la fenêtre de la chambre d'Albert, on voit, en plongée,
          Gabriel qui marche dans la rue, où, maintenant, il ne pleut plus.
          Il se dirige vers un café situé à quelques mètres de l'hôtel, dans
          une rue qui coupe la rue de l'hôtel à angle droit, le « Café
          Normand ».
                         
          TIGREVILLE - RUE HÔTEL STELLA - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Contre-champ et plan rapproché sur la fenêtre d'Albert, vue de la
          rue. Albert et Suzanne regardent dans la rue, écartant chacun un
          rideau pour mieux voir.
          HOTEL STELLA - CHAMBRE ALBERT - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Retour au plan en plongée, vu de la fenêtre de la chambre. Gabriel
          est maintenant arrivé au café et regarde à travers les rideaux qui
          décorent les vitres de l'établissement. Puis il se dirige vers la
          porte qu'il ouvre.
                         
          CAFÉ NORMAND - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Le « Café Normand » est un petit bistro provincial typique de
          l'époque. Comptoir en bois avec « zinc » vraiment en zinc. Vitres
          protégés par des rideaux blancs bien repassés. Cendriers
          publicitaires « Picon » ou « Martini »sur le comptoir. Derrière le
          comptoir, des étagères avec des bouteilles d'alcool, des verres,
          une machine expresso, le tout devant un grand miroir qui couvre
          tout le mur.
                         
          Gabriel entre dans le café et referme la porte derrière lui.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Messieurs !...
          Il s'assoit sur un tabouret en bois devant le comptoir. Il se
          retourne lentement, car il vient de s'apercevoir que le brouhaha
          ambiant s'est tu soudainement à son entrée.
                         
          Contrechamp montrant la salle du café. Au fond, la salle de
          billard, communiquant sans séparation avec le reste de la salle du
          café, mais à laquelle on accède par trois marches. Deux hommes
          sont en train de jouer au billard. A côté du billard, une vieille
          femme, Joséphine, seule à une table. Le long du mur qui prolonge
          la vitrine du café, des tables, derrière lesquelles sont assis des
          clients, visiblement des marins, ou d'anciens marins, vu leur
          costumes et leurs casquettes. De l'autre côté de la salle, une
          table où le patron, Lucien Esnault, est en train de manger en face
          de son épouse, une femme brune au chignon sévère. Simone, la
          serveuse, une petite jeune femme blonde d'allure sympathique,
          portant un grand tablier blanc, et tenant un torchon à la main,
          quitte la table des « marins » et se dirige vers le comptoir.
          Joséphine, Madame Esnault et Simone sont les trois seules femmes
          présentes dans le café. Les conversations reprennent.
                         
          Retour sur Gabriel tourné vers le comptoir, derrière lequel Simone
          vient d'arriver.
                         
                          SIMONE
           Pour monsieur, ce sera ?...
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Un Picon-bière.
                         
          Simone reste interdite : elle semble ne pas savoir ce qu'est
          exactement un Picon-bière. Elle pose un verre sur le comptoir
          devant Gabriel. Puis, de dessous le comptoir, elle sort une
          bouteille d'un litre de bière, fermée par un bouchon mécanique.
          Elle ouvre la bouteille, qui fait un « pop » caractéristique. Elle
          se retourne pour prendre une bouteille de Picon sur l'étagère
          derrière elle. Elle débouche la bouteille, puis prend les deux
          bouteilles, une dans chaque main, et se tourne vers la salle.
                          SIMONE
           M'sieur Esnault... pour un Picon-bière, c'est moitié-
           moitié ?
                         
          Contre champ. La caméra est placée derrière Simone, et montre
          Gabriel en premier plan, assis devant le comptoir, et derrière
          lui, en arrière plan, la salle du café.
                         
          Gabriel prend les bouteilles des mains de Simone.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Ça peut le devenir, mais pas maintenant.
                         
          Il pose la bouteille de bière sur le comptoir, et commence à
          verser le Picon dans son verre.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je saute pas l'obstacle sans élan. Vous allez voir, j'ai ma
           recette.
                         
          Il pose la bouteille de Picon, prend la bouteille de bière et
          verse la bière dans son verre.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Pendant ce temps, faites-moi un numéro de téléphone.
                         
                          SIMONE
           Pour ici ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Non.
                         
                          SIMONE
           Pour Paris ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Non. Pour Madrid.
                         
          Il pose la bouteille de bière et sort, de la poche de sa veste, un
          papier qu'il tend à Simone.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Tenez, il est là-dessus.
                         
          Simone se dirige vers le téléphone, posé à l'extrémité du
          comptoir. Elle pose la main sur le téléphone, puis se tourne vers
          la salle.
                         
                          SIMONE
           M'sieur Esnault... Pour téléphoner à Madrid, comment on
           fait ?
                         
          Dans la salle, Lucien, toujours à table avec sa femme, et qui
          tourne le dos au comptoir, s'essuie la bouche et se lève de table.
          Il s'approche du comptoir, et actionne la manette d'appel du
          téléphone.
                         
          (NOTE - A cet époque, seules certaines grandes villes, comme
          Paris, avait un réseau téléphonique automatique. Pour la plupart
          des petites villes de province, il fallait passer par un standard,
          qui vous mettait en relation avec le correspondant demandé.)
                         
          Simone fait le tour du comptoir pour donner le papier de Gabriel à
          Lucien, qui le prend et décroche le combiné. Avant de parler, il
          se tourne vers la salle.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Un peu de silence, je téléphone en Espagne.
                         
          Les conversations s'arrêtent à la table des « marins », qui se
          tournent tous vers Lucien. Ce dernier, le combiné à la main,
          regarde le papier de Gabriel.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Mademoiselle Claire comment ?...
                         
          Il se tourne vers Gabriel.
                         
          Plan moyen de Gabriel, au comptoir, en train de boire son Picon-
          bière. Il baisse son verre.
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Claire Prévost.
                         
          Il recommence à boire lentement.
                         
           LUCIEN ESNAULT (voix off)
           Pour le 14 à Tigreville, je voudrais le 39...
                         
          Retour sur Lucien qui lit le papier au téléphone.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           48 00... à Madrid.
                         
           VOIX DE L'OPÉRATRICE (voix off dans le téléphone)
           En Espagne ?...
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Ben oui, en Espagne. Un préavis pour mademoiselle Claire
           Prévost.
                         
           VOIX DE L'OPÉRATRICE (voix off dans le téléphone)
           Quelques minutes d'attente.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Hé ! Allo ! Avec I.D.
                         
           VOIX DE L'OPÉRATRICE (voix off dans le téléphone)
           D'accord.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Oui, merci.
                         
          Il raccroche. Il replie le papier et le rend à Gabriel.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Ils rappellent, y a quelques minutes d'attente.
                         
          Gabriel remet le papier dans sa poche.
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           En attendant, qu'est-ce que je vous offre ?
                         
          Lucien, qui se préparait à retourner vers la table, où sa femme
          continue à diner seule, s'accoude au comptoir.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Oh, un petit Calva.
                         
          Gabriel fait signe à Simone derrière le comptoir.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Un Calva pour monsieur.
                         
          Il reprend les deux bouteilles, une dans chaque main, et commence
          à verser le Picon, puis la bière, dans son verre.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Pour moi, même jeu, la même couleur !
                         
          Simone dépose un verre vide devant Lucien. Puis elle prend une
          bouteille de Calva sous le comptoir, la débouche et verse l'alcool
          dans le verre.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Dites donc, ils ont l'air de se coucher de bonne heure en
           face.
                         
          Lucien se redresse avec un large sourire.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Ahhh ! Parce que vous êtes descendu chez Quentin ! Ben vous
           avez pas fini de rigoler.
                         
          Simone rebouche la bouteille et la repose sous le comptoir.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Avec lui, si vous avez pas soif, vous serez tout de suite
           servi. Je sais même pas s'il sert encore du vin à table.
           Hum ! Sacré Albert !
                         
          Il se tourne vers la salle.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Ah, on peut dire qu'il a sauté la barrière, celui-là.
                         
          Il revient vers Gabriel.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Parce que, hein, pardon... Joyeux compagnon, mesdames ! Pas
           snob sur le biberon, c'est moi qui vous le dis. Allez,
           venez...
                         
          Il prend son verre et fait signe à Gabriel de le suivre en salle.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           On a bien rigolé, il y a quinze ans, tous les deux. Tandem
           terrible, connu sur la région.
          Il fait quelques pas, suivi de Gabriel, qui a aussi pris son
          verre, puis il s'arrête de marcher.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Parce que vous en fûtes ?
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Comme vous dites. Et pas manchot. Et puis un jour, crac,
           fini, plus un verre, l'abstinence, le gâtisme. C'est de ce
           jour-là qu'il a changé.
                         
          Il reprend sa marche.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           On dirait qu'il y a plus que le mauvais qui ressort.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Qu'est-ce que vous appelez le mauvais ?
                         
          Lucien s'assoit sur la banquette d'une table à côté des
          « marins ». Gabriel s'assoit en face de lui.
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Côté renfermé, cette espèce de prétention, pas faire comme
           tout le monde... Un genre, quoi !
                         
          Un vieux « marin », en blouson de cuir, assis juste à côté de
          Lucien, qui a des cartes dans une main et une cigarette dans
          l'autre, se tourne vers Lucien.
                         
           LE « MARIN » EN BLOUSON DE CUIR
           Mais il l'a toujours eu, le genre. L'a-t-y pas été faire
           son service militaire en Chine ? Je vous demande un peu.
                         
          A côté de lui, sur la banquette, un homme portant un béret, une
          pipe au bec, se mêle à la conversation.
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           C'est comme la prétention qu'il a toujours eu dans ses
           lectures. Vous croyez peut-être qu'il lit le journal comme
           tout le monde ? Ah ! Pensez-vous ! Des bouquins plein une
           malle. Tu te rappelles les soirs où il nous emmerdait
           avec... et comment qu'il l'appelait, celui-là ?... Un gros
           qu'avait un nom d'eau gazeuse... A... Ap...
           Appolinarès ?... Apolina...
                         
           LE « MARIN » AU BLOUSON DE CUIR
           Appolinaris !...
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Ah !...
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Ah, je dis pas qu'il a pas toujours été fou. Mais avant, il
           communiquait. C'est depuis qu'il a arrêté de boire qu'il a
           muté sournois. Il est plus rien. Allez donc voir ce qui se
           passe là-dedans.
                         
          Il se tapote le front. Un autre client, assis à la table voisine,
          s'assoit sur la banquette à côté de l'homme au béret.
           LE CLIENT DE LA TABLE VOISINE
           Et d'après Billoux, qu'a servi chez lui, paraît qu'il avait
           des sortes d'éblouissements... de malaises.
                         
          Lucien se lève.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Je ne dis pas non. Car il aurait comme un cancer ou une
           cirrhose du foie que je serais le premier à lui tirer mon
           chapeau, mais alors qu'il le dise, Bon Dieu, c'est tout ce
           qu'on lui demande.
                         
          Le téléphone sonne. Lucien contourne la table.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Tiens, ça doit être Madrid.
                         
          Il se dirige vers le comptoir.
                         
          Arrivé au comptoir, il décroche le téléphone. Derrière lui, on
          voit Gabriel, qui est resté sans bouger à sa place, et qui
          continue à boire.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Allo ! Allo !
                         
           VOIX DE L'OPÉRATRICE (voix off dans le téléphone)
           Le 14 à Tigreville ?
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Oui.
                         
           VOIX DE L'OPÉRATRICE (voix off dans le téléphone)
           Madrid.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Ne quittez pas.
                         
          Il se tourne vers Gabriel.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           C'est Madrid.
                         
          Il pose le combiné sur le comptoir. Gabriel, son verre à la main,
          se lève lentement et se dirige vers le comptoir. Lucien retourne
          s'assoir sur la banquette. Gabriel arrive au comptoir sur lequel
          il pose son verre. Il prend le combiné et le porte à son oreille.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Allo ! La résidence Mora ?...
                         
          Derrière lui, Lucien et les « marins » sont tous tournés vers lui,
          et ne perdent pas une miette de la conversation.
                         
           VOIX ESPAGNOLE (voix off dans le téléphone)
           Si señor. Digame ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Mademoiselle Claire Prévost.
           VOIX ESPAGNOLE (voix off dans le téléphone)
           Un secondo. Le pongo.
                         
          Un long silence.
                         
           CLAIRE (voix off dans le téléphone)
           Allo ?... Allo ?... Mais enfin, qui appelle ?... Allo ?...
           Mais répondez ! Qui est à l'appareil ?
                         
          Gabriel raccroche lentement sans répondre. Puis il reprend son
          verre sur le comptoir, se dirige vers les deux bouteilles, remplit
          son verre, d'abord de Picon, puis de bière, repose les bouteilles,
          porte le verre à ses lèvres, et le boit lentement.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - RUE HÔTEL STELLA - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Même plan rapproché sur la fenêtre de la chambre d'Albert que
          celui vu juste avant que Gabriel entre dans le café.
                         
          Albert est maintenant seul à scruter la rue derrière les rideaux.
          Il laisse retomber le rideau et s'éloigne de la fenêtre.
          HOTEL STELLA - CHAMBRE ALBERT - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Albert s'éloigne de la fenêtre dont il vient de laisser retomber
          le rideau. Il se rapproche du miroir au-dessus de la cheminée,
          miroir dans lequel on voit le lit, dans lequel Suzanne est
          couchée. Il ouvre une boîte à bonbons posée sur la cheminée.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Qu'est-ce qu'il peut bien faire là-bas ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Chercher ce qu'on ne trouve plus chez nous.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Tu regrettes ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Pourquoi veux-tu que je regrettes ? J'ai mes bonbons, moi.
                         
          Il met un bonbon dans sa bouche. Il se rapproche lentement d'un
          cadre accroché au mur à droite de la cheminée. Ce cadre montre une
          photo d'Albert en uniforme colonial, posant devant un fleuve sur
          lequel navigue une jonque. A droite de ce cadre, un autre cadre
          montre une autre photo d'Albert devant le bastingage d'un bateau.
          Derrière lui, sur le fleuve, navigue aussi une jonque. Albert
          regarde longuement les photos, en croquant son bonbon.
                         
          A moitié assise dans son lit, Suzanne l'observe.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Albert...
                         
          Albert regarde toujours les photos au mur.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Hmmm !...
          Il se retourne.
                         
          Suzanne le regarde avec un pointe d'inquiétude dans les yeux.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Allez, viens te coucher, va.
                         
          Mâchouillant toujours son bonbon, Albert s'éloigne des photos. La
          caméra reste un temps en plan fixe sur les photos, puis la lumière
          s'éteint dans la pièce.
                         
          CAFÉ NORMAND - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Simone s'éloigne du comptoir avec un plateau chargé de verres de
          vin. On entend beaucoup de brouhaha dans la salle. Simone passe
          devant Madame Esnault, assise seule à la même table que
          précédemment. La nappe a été enlevée, et une tasse de café est
          posée devant la patronne. Il n'y a plus de joueurs autour du
          billard, mais Joséphine est toujours assise seule à sa table à
          côté du billard, donc légèrement surélevée par rapport à la salle.
          Simone s'approche de la table des marins, qui sont tous pliés en
          deux de rire. Seul Gabriel, en premier plan, ne semble pas
          partager l'hilarité générale. Il verse le fond de la bouteille de
          Picon dans son verre. En face de lui, Lucien rigole avec ses
          clients. Simone pose son plateau en bout de table.
                         
                          JOSÉPHINE
           Moi, Hitler, tout ce que j'avais à lui reprocher, c'est ses
           moustaches.
                         
          Au son de sa voix, il est évident que Joséphine a un peu trop bu.
          Les rires, qui s'étaient interrompus pour la laisser parler,
          reprennent de plus belle. Simone pose chaque verre devant son
          destinataire. Au premier plan, Gabriel se lève lourdement, la
          bouteille à la main. Il lève la bouteille en l'air.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Une autre bouteille !
                         
          Simone s'approche de Gabriel, mais personne d'autre ne semble
          s'intéresser à lui.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Joséphine, raconte un peu à monsieur ce que tu faisais sous
           l'occupation.
                         
          Simone prend la bouteille de la main de Gabriel et s'éloigne vers
          le bar. Gabriel reste debout.
                         
          Plan moyen de Joséphine, le verre à la main.
                         
                          JOSÉPHINE
           J'écrivais à la Kommandantur, et je dénonçais tous les
           malfaisants.
                         
          Éclats de rire en voix off.
                         
                          JOSÉPHINE
           Tiens, toi, je t'ai dénoncé plus de dix fois pour marché
           noir. Mais ils ont jamais voulu me croire.
          Contrechamp avec la caméra placé dans le dos de Joséphine, et
          montrant la table des « marins » en contrebas. Gabriel est
          toujours debout. Le client, qui était auparavant installé à la
          table voisine, se tourne vers Gabiel.
                         
           LE CLIENT DE LA TABLE VOISINE
           Quand on vous disait que c'était un phénomène !
                         
          Simone apporte une nouvelle bouteille de Picon à Gabriel, qui se
          rassoit. Le « marin » au blouson de cuir lève son verre vers
          Gabriel.
                         
           LE « MARIN » AU BLOUSON DE CUIR
           Et bien, m'sieur, à votre santé !
                         
          Plan moyen sur Gabriel qui verse de la bière dans son verre. On
          entend des clients qui lui parlent en voix off, mais il est
          difficile de savoir qui parle exactement.
                         
           UN CLIENT (voix off)
           Voilà une tournée qui vous portera bonheur !
           UN AUTRE CLIENT (voix off)
           La première fois que vous venez à Tigreville, ben ce sera
           pas la dernière ! On a vingt milles parisiens tous les
           étés, ben y en avait même depuis avant la guerre.
                         
          Gabriel boit son verre par gorgées, le regard un peu vague.
                         
           UN AUTRE CLIENT (voix off)
           Ah oui, c'est vrai.
                         
          Le début de la réplique d'un autre client est rendue
          incompréhensible par le brouhaha ambiant.
                         
           UN AUTRE CLIENT (voix off)
           Question iode, on craint personne, même pas Berck.
                         
          Plan sur la table des « marins ». Le vieux « marin » au blouson de
          cuir pointe son doigt vers Gabriel.
                         
           LE « MARIN » AU BLOUSON DE CUIR
           Dans un journal, on nous appelle la Californie Normande.
                         
          Tous les autres « marins » approuvent. Le marin au blouson de cuir
          lève son verre.
                         
           LE « MARIN » AU BLOUSON DE CUIR
           Messieurs !... A Tigreville !...
                         
          Tous lèvent leurs verres, y compris Lucien, en disant : « A
          Tigreville !» Gabriel se lève, le verre à la main, et dit, d'une
          voix un peu pâteuse :
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Messieurs... Votre accueil me bouleverse, mais ne saurait
           égarer mon jugement. J'ai tout de même pas mal voyagé, ce
           qui me permet de vous dire, en connaissance de cause, que
           votre patelin est tarte comme il est pas permis et qu'il y
           fait un temps de merde !
                         
          Il se penche sur la table pour parler plus près des visages des
          « marins », qui éberlués par l'impertinence de Gabriel, reposent
          lentement leurs verres sur la table.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Je suppose que monsieur plaisante...
                         
          Gabriel se tourne vers lui.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Absolument pas.
                         
          Le marin au blouson de cuir se lève pour faire face à Gabriel
                         
           LE « MARIN » AU BLOUSON DE CUIR
           Vous savez combien y a eu de jours de soleil en
           Juillet ?... Dix-sept !
                         
          Gabriel rapproche son visage du sien.
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Soleil de mes fesses ! Vous savez pas ce que c'est que le
           soleil ! Vous l'avez jamais vu, vous !
                         
          D'une bourrade, il repousse le marin, qui retombe sur ses amis sur
          la banquette. Puis il monte sur « l'estrade » du billard. Arrivé
          en haut des trois marches, il commence à danser le flamenco en
          tapant du pied par terre, à la manière des danseurs espagnols.
          Tous les clients du café le regarde, un peu subjugués par cette
          démonstration inhabituelle d'ivresse.
                         
          Plusieurs gros plans sur les pieds de Gabriel en train de danser.
                         
          (NOTE - Lors des gros plans de pieds, ce n'est pas l'acteur Jean-
          Paul Belmondo qui danse, mais il est doublé par un véritable
          danseur de flamenco. C'est aussi la raison pour laquelle, sur la
          plupart des autres plans, on ne voit que le haut du corps de
          Gabriel, à partir de la taille.)
                         
          Gabriel saute de l'estrade sur la table de la patronne, qui ôte
          prestement sa tasse de café, se lève et s'éloigne de la table.
          Gabriel continue à danser sur la table.
                         
          A la fin de la démonstration de Flamenco, Gabriel saute à terre.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           C'est ça, le soleil !
                         
          Il s'avance, en titubant un peu, vers la table. D'un geste rapide
          du bras, il balaie tous les verres posés sur la table.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Ahhhh !... Mais je veux pas voir de verres vides.
                         
          Lucien se lève, et alpague Gabriel, aidé par l'un des « marins ».
          Gabriel repousse Lucien. Tous les clients du bar se sont levés, et
          se sont regroupés autour de Gabriel. Derrière lui, un homme le
          pousse. Gabriel se retourne, près à se battre. Puis il se retourne
          de nouveau vers Lucien, que sa femme retient par le bras. Il prend
          une liasse de billets dans sa poche et les lance en l'air.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Quieto !
                         
                          UN MARIN
           Il est peut-être armé !...
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Le monsieur paie !... Les gens de ma suite vont venir... ce
           sont des gitans... traitez-les comme moi-même.
                         
          Lucien l'attrape par le col de sa veste.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           A coups de pompe dans le train que je vais vous traiter !
                         
          Gabriel le repousse avec force, repoussant aussi, en même temps,
          tous les clients groupés derrière lui.
                         
          Il se plante devant la porte d'entrée.
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Arrière, les esquimaux ! Je rentre seul... le matador
           rentre toujours seul. Plus il est grand, plus il est seul.
           Je vous laisse à vos banquises, à vos igloos, à vos
           pingouins. ¡
                         
          Il se tourne vers madame Esnault.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Por favor Señora ! À quelle heure le train pour Madrid ?
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Dans cinq minutes ! Si tu te dépêches pas, tu le loupes !
                         
          Gabriel le regarde posément, se retourne lentement et ouvre la
          porte. Lucien le pousse violemment dehors.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Allez, ouste, avant que je me fâche !
                         
          TIGREVILLE - RUE HÔTEL STELLA - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Poussé par Lucien, Gabriel sort du café en titubant. Il manque
          s'étaler par terre, mais se redresse. La porte du café s'est
          refermée. Gabriel se dirige vers l'hôtel en zigzaguant. Il manque
          de nouveau s'étaler par terre, mais s'appuie sur le mur en face de
          l'hôtel. Il attends un instant, puis reprend sa progression
          hésitante vers l'hôtel. Finalement, il s'étale à plat ventre par
          terre.
                         
          CAFÉ NORMAND - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Dans le café, tous les clients sont toujours debout. Lucien
          observe Gabriel en écartant le rideau de la vitrine. Il se tourne
          vers le client au béret.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Va l'aider à traverser la rue, il y arrivera jamais tout
           seul.
                         
          L'homme au béret ouvre la porte et sort en refermant la porte
          derrière lui.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Le Picon-bière, ça pardonne pas. C'est de ça que mon pauvre
           papa est mort ! Y a rien de plus traître !
                         
          Il reprend son observation derrière le rideau de la vitrine.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - RUE HÔTEL STELLA - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          L'homme au béret trotte vers Gabriel, toujours couché par terre au
          milieu de la rue. Il l'aide à se relever.
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Allons !...
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           J'ai buté contre un piège à phoques !
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Ah oui, mais c'est rien que ça ! Allez !...
                         
          Gabriel passe le bras autour des épaules de l'homme, qui l'aide à
          marcher vers l'hôtel.
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Appuie-toi sur mon épaule.
                         
          Gabriel le regarde en souriant et le pointe du doigt.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           T'as une bonne tête, toi !
                         
          Il lève les yeux vers l'hôtel.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           C'est la gare ?
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Oui.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Tu veux un billet de quai ?
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Non, c'est pas la peine.
                         
          Gabriel se dégage de son étreinte, et se dirige vers la porte de
          l'hôtel.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Allez, Ciao !
                         
          L'homme au béret agite la main.
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Bon voyage !
                         
          On entend, en bruit off, la porte de l'hôtel qui se referme
          lourdement.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - CHAMBRE ALBERT - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Suzanne et Albert dorment dans leur lit. On entend des bruits de
          pas mal assurés. Suzanne se redresse brusquement sur le lit.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           C'est lui, c'est lui qui rentre.
                         
          Albert ne bouge pas.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Hmm !...
                         
          Les bruits de pas hésitants continuent. Puis un bruit de chute
          prolongée, comme quelqu'un qui dévale un escalier. Suzanne se
          tourne vers Albert.
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Tu vois ce que je te disais.
                         
          Albert bouge lentement dans le lit.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh, merde !
                         
          Il s'extirpe lentement de sous ses draps, s'assoit sur le rebord
          du lit, allume sa lampe de chevet, puis se lève. Suzanne le
          regarde traverser la chambre. On entend le bruit de la porte qui
          s'ouvre, puis qui se ferme en claquant.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - COULOIR PREMIER ÉTAGE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Plan en contre-plongée d'Albert, en pyjama, arrivant sur le palier
          de l'étage. Il regarde dans la pénombre en contrebas, puis il
          allume la lumière pour mieux voir.
                         
          Plan en plongée de Gabriel étalé sur le dos au pied de l'escalier.
          Il se redresse légèrement et ricane bêtement.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Salut, papa !
                         
          Par signe, il explique sa chute, tout en continuant à ricaner.
          Albert descend l'escalier.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - VESTIBULE DE RÉCEPTION - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Gabriel s'accroche des deux mains à la rampe pour essayer de se
          relever, mais n'y arrive pas. Albert arrive à sa hauteur.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et ben, qu'est-ce qui vous arrive ?
                         
          Il l'aide à se relever.
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           J'ai voulu descendre du train en marche.
                         
          Il est enfin debout.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh, ben oui, ça doit être ça !... Allez, tenez-vous bien.
                         
          Il le soutient pour l'aider à monter l'escalier. Gabriel fait
          trois pas, puis rate une marche.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Attention !... Allez...

          Plan en légère plongée, montrant Albert et Gabriel gravissant les
          dernières marches de l'escalier.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Ah, mon vieux papa !... Heureusement que je t'ai, hein ?
          Il viennent d'atteindre le palier.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Ça t'ennuie pas que je t'appelle papa ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ben non, ça m'ennuie pas.
                         
          Il le guide le long du couloir.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           On va aller boire un petit verre, tous les deux, sans rien
           dire à personne.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Merci, mais moi, je ne bois pas.
                         
          Ils viennent de dépasser la chambre d'Albert. La porte s'ouvre et
          Suzanne apparaît, en chemise de nuit. Gabriel se retourne.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Oh ben, la señora, là, elle a peut-être envie d'aller
           porter un toast à...
                         
          Albert le tient à bout de bras plaqué contre le mur.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           La señora, elle a surtout envie de roupiller. Allez...
                         
          Il le laisse appuyé contre le mur, pendant qu'il ouvre la porte de
          sa chambre. Gabriel fait un petit signe de la main et un sourire
          niais à Suzanne, qui rentre précipitamment dans sa chambre.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - CHAMBRE GABRIEL - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Albert allume la lumière dans la chambre, puis traverse le
          couloir, pour récupérer Gabriel, toujours appuyé contre le mur.
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Allez...
                         
          Soutenu par Albert, Gabriel entre dans sa chambre.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Viens, je t'emmène au Prado... Tu connais le Prado ?...
                         
          Albert le guide vers son lit.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Un jardin avec un musée dessus. Oh, ben, c'est pas des
           trucs à me faire relever la nuit, ça.
                         
          Il appuie Gabriel contre la rambarde au pied du lit, puis se
          dirige vers la tête du lit, pour rabattre le couvre-lit.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Claire et moi, on y allait tout le temps. On prenait deux
           Prado, et on avait des rêves pour cent ans.
                         
          Il se tourne vers Albert, qui finit de rabattre le couvre-lit.
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Et Claire... Tu vas me dire que tu la connais aussi, peut-
           être ?...
                         
          Albert le prend par le torse et le guide vers le lit.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           C'est votre amie ?
                         
          Gabriel hoche la tête.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Ouais, c'est mon amie... une amie qui s'est tirée !...
           C'est pas gentil, ça !
                         
          Albert vient de réussir à l'assoir sur le lit.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Allez !...
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Pas beau ! Alors, tu vois, tu pas refuser de boire avec un
           type qu'a plus d'amie.
                         
          Albert le couche sur le lit.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mais je vous ai déjà dit que je ne buvais pas. Allez...
           Là...
                         
          Il se relève et se dirige vers la porte.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Maintenant, je vais éteindre, et vous allez dormir, hein ?
                         
          Gabriel se redresse brusquement sur son lit.
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Non !
                         
          Il tend la main vers Albert.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           J'ai une meilleure idée. Je vais faire monter deux Xérès.
                         
          Il se recouche et appuie sur la sonnette du service en chambre.

          est fixé un gros tableau de contrôle avec une voyant lumineux pour

          Plan en plongée du palier du premier étage, vu du plafond au-
          dessus de l'escalier. Une porte s'ouvre et une jeune femme en
          chemise de nuit vient s'accouder à la rambarde. Il s'agit de
          Marie-Jo, l'employée résidente de l'hôtel.
                         
                          MARIE-JO
           Ben, qu'est-ce qu'y a ? Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
                         
          Elle lève les yeux vers le plafond.
                         
          Plan moyen du couloir. Albert sort de la chambre de Gabriel et
          fait un pas hors de la chambre.
                         
           MARIE-JO (voix off)
           Qui est-ce qui a sonné ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Personne... Retournez vous coucher, Marie-Jo.

          Albert rentre dans la chambre et referme la porte. Gabriel le
          rejoint près de la porte.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je vais inviter la patronne à prendre un verre.
                         
          Albert le repousse vers l'intérieur de la chambre.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Elle dort, la patronne. Tout le monde dort. Allez...
                         
          Il le prend par le bras et le guide vers son lit.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Les manières se perdent. On s'est jamais couché si tôt à
           Madrid.
                         
          Arrivé devant l'armoire à glace, il se retourne vers Albert.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           J'espère qu'elle me fera tout de même la grâce d'assister à
           mes débuts aux Arènes Monumentales.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Je lui ferai part de votre aimable invitation.
                         
          Gabriel se tourne vers la glace et regarde son reflet.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Y aura du monde... Luis Miguel attire toujours la foule...
           Y a longtemps que je rêve de triompher à Madrid... Le
           public sera exigeant... surtout derrière Miguelito.
                         
          Il se tourne vers Albert, qui le regarde avec une tendresse mêlée
          de nostalgie.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je vais être obligé de prendre des risques.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et bien, j'espère que tout se passera bien.
          Gabriel marche vers le milieu de la chambre. Il parle avec de
          grands gestes et une voix passionnée.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je mettrai mon costume blanc... celui de mes débuts. Vous
           vous souvenez de cette Novillada de Tolède ? Ce vent froid,
           ce public affreux... et ce taureau qui voulait pas mourir.
           Mais depuis, j'en ai estoqué plus de cent... Je suis le
           plus grand matador français... Gabriel Fouquet, plus grand
           que Pierre Schul... Yo soy unico !
                         
          D'un geste vif, il ramasse la nappe sur la table, et commence à
          tournoyer dans la chambre, se servant de la nappe comme de la cape
          d'un matador, faisant des passes à un taureau imaginaire. Il
          prononce les paroles rituelles des matador en espagnol. Albert
          s'assoit sur une chaise pour le regarder. A la fin de sa courte
          prestation, Gabriel se tourne vers Albert, gardant la nappe à la
          main dans la position figée de la cape du matador.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Ça vous intéresse, papa ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Peut-être...
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Qu'est-ce qui vous intéresse ?... Le matador, le taureau,
           où l'Espagne.
                         
          Plan rapproché sur la nappe, qui tourne, découvrant Albert en plan
          moyen.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Le voyage... votre façon de voyager.
                         
          Gabriel pose la nappe et s'assoit sur le lit.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Ah ! Ça, c'est un secret.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh, la-la ! Le véhicule, je le connais, je l'ai déjà pris.
           Et c'était pas un train de banlieue, vous pouvez me croire.
           Monsieur Fouquet, moi aussi, il m'est arrivé de boire. Et
           ça m'envoyait un peu plus loin que l'Espagne. Le Yang-Tsé-
           Kiang, vous avez déjà entendu parler du Yang-Tsé-Kiang ? Ça
           tient de la place dans une chambre, moi, je vous le dis.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Sûr... Et alors ?... Deux Xérès ?...
                         
          Albert hoche négativement la tête.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Je ne bois plus. Je croque des bonbons.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Et ça vous mène loin ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           En Chine, toujours... mais plus la même. Maintenant, c'est
           une espèce de Chine d'antiquaire. Quant à descendre le
           Yang-Tsé-Kiang en une nuit, c'est hors de question.
           Pfft !... Un petit bout par-ci, un petit bout par-là... Et
           encore, pas tous les soirs.
                         
          Il sourit.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Les sucreries font bouchon.
                         
          Il se lève.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Allez... Bonsoir.
                         
          Il fait deux pas vers la porte.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Papa !
                         
          Albert se retourne vers le lit, sur lequel Gabriel est toujours
          assis.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oui ?...
                         
          Gabriel écarte les bras.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je crois que j'ai raté mon train pour Madrid !
                         
          Il retombe à plat ventre sur le lit. Albert le regarde.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Monsieur Fouquet, quand on a les rêves que vous avez dans
           la tête, on ne se tourmente pas pour un train raté.
          Il se rapproche du lit, et prend la rambarde du pied de lit à deux
          mains.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Savez-vous à qui vous me faites penser ? A un de ces singes
           égarés, comme on en rencontre en Orient au moment des
           premiers froids...
                         
          Il regarde Gabriel avec plus d'attention et s'aperçoit qu'il s'est
          endormi. Il se retourne et se dirige lentement vers la porte. Il
          éteint la lumière, ouvre la porte, sort de la chambre et referme
          la porte derrière lui.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - CHAMBRE ALBERT - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Albert entre dans la chambre et referme la porte derrière lui.
          Suzanne est assise dans le lit.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Alors, qu'est-ce qui lui est arrivé ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh, rien, il a bu un coup de trop, c'est tout.
                         
          Il s'assoit sur le bord du lit pour enlever ses pantoufles.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Vous avez parlé de quoi ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Offf !... De singes... De singes et de singerie...
                         
          Il se glisse sous les draps. Suzanne en fait autant.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Allez...
                         
          Il éteint sa lampe de chevet. Suzanne garde les yeux grand
          ouverts. Elle semble songeuse.
                         
          Fondu au noir.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - LE PORT - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Plan moyen de la voiture d'Albert, une DS break. Albert vient de
          se garer à côté d'un « cube » Citroën, et sort du véhicule. Il
          porte une épaisse parka à col de fourrure, style « canadienne ».
          Il marche le long du bassin du port et passe devant des bateaux de
          pêches amarrés à quai.
                         
          Plan d'ensemble de la partie du port, où les pêcheurs débarquent
          leur poisson. Albert enjambe une amarre, et continue son chemin,
          passant devant un pêcheur vendant son poisson à la criée.
                         
          Plan moyen sur des cageots de poissons. Deux femmes sont en train
          de les trier, les répartissant dans les cageots.
                         
                          LE MARIN
           Hé !... T'as vu mes dorades ?...
          Albert serre distraitement la main du marin et continue à circuler
          entre les étals de poissons. Chaque marin-pêcheur a disposé sa
          pêche sur une planche posée sur deux tréteaux, tout le long du
          quai. Albert s'approche d'un autre étal et serre la main du marin.
          Apparemment, concentré sur les cageots de poisson, il n'a pas vu
          Lucien, debout, les mains dans les poches, à l'extrémité de l'étal
                         
                          LE MARIN
           Salut.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Combien, ces rougets ?...
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Ils sont bien, mais ils sont retenus. Toi aussi, je te
           retiens. Je te remercie pour la soirée d'hier.
                         
          Le marin suit la conversation en regardant alternativement Lucien
          et Albert.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Quelle soirée ?
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Oh, fais pas celui qui comprend pas. Ton client, là, ton
           Espagnol. Douze verres cassés, ça te dit rien ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Dis donc, toi. Primo, ça fait quinze ans que je t'interdis
           de me parler. Deuxio, si tu voulais pas qu'il boive,
           t'avais qu'à pas le servir.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Alors, là, monsieur Quentin, je te rétorque que primo, je
           l'ai viré. Deuxio, des ivrognes, il y en a assez dans le
           pays, sans que tu les fasses venir de Paris !
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Un ivrogne ?
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Oh ben un peu, oui ! Même que le père Bardasse, qui boit
           quinze Pastis par jour, il en revenait pas.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ahh ! Parce que tu mélanges tout ça, toi, mon Espagnol,
           comme tu dis, et le père Bardasse, les Grands-Ducs et les
           boit-sans-soif !
                         
          Il se rapproche de Lucien.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Les Grands-Ducs ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oui, monsieur, les princes de la cuite, les seigneurs, ceux
           avec qui tu buvais le coup dans le temps et qui ont
           toujours fait verre à part. Dis-toi bien que tes clients et
           toi, ils vous laissent à vos putasseries, les seigneurs.
           Ils sont à cent milles verres de vous. Eux, ils tutoient
           les anges !
                         
          Il s'éloigne de Lucien.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Excuse-moi, mais, nous autres, on est encore capable de
           tenir le litre sans se prendre pour Dieu le Père.
                         
          Albert se retourne.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mais... c'est bien ce que je vous reproche. Vous avez le
           vin petit et la cuite mesquine. Dans le fond, vous méritez
           pas de boire. Tu te demandes pourquoi il picole,
           l'Espagnol ? C'est pour essayer d'oublier les pignoufs
           comme vous !
                         
          Il se tourne vers le marin, toujours debout et stoïque derrière
          son étal.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Combien qu'il fait, ton lot de rougets, là ?
          Plan rapproché sur trois cageots plein de rougets, posés sur de la
          glace pilée sur l'étal du marin.
                         
           LE MARIN (voix off)
           Trois cents francs le kilo.
                         
          Plan d'ensemble sur l'étal du marin (vu de dos) avec le port
          derrière Albert.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Je te préviens : j'en ai retenu la moitié.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et bien, moi, je prends le tout. Allez, emballe-le moi, je
           vais venir le prendre.
                         
          Il s'éloigne lentement.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Décidément, on peut plus causer de rien, avec toi, tiens.
                         
          Albert, avant de quitter l'étal, se retourne une dernière fois
          vers Lucien.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           T'es trop con !
                         
          Albert s'éloigne lentement, les mains dans les poches. Lucien
          s'éloigne aussi, dans la même direction qu'Albert, mais à
          distance.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - CUISINE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Plan rapproché sur le tableau d'appel des chambres. Le voyant n° 8
          s'allume et sonne. En-dessous du tableau, un plan de travail, sur
          lequel un plateau de petit-déjeuner est posé. Marie-Jo apporte une
          grosse cafetière en métal, qu'elle pose sur le plateau. Elle prend
          le plateau et sort de la cuisine vers la salle à manger.
                         
          La caméra reste dans la cuisine et suit Marie-Jo qui traverse la
          salle à manger vers le vestibule. Assise à une table, Suzanne est
          occupée à gérer la paperasserie de l'hôtel. Elle tourne légèrement
          la tête vers Marie-Jo.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Ah, tout de même !
                         
          Marie-Jo ne s'arrête pas et continue son chemin vers la porte
          ouverte du vestibule de réception. A travers les vitres de la
          salle à manger, on la voit monter l'escalier.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - CHAMBRE GABRIEL - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          La porte s'ouvre et Marie-Jo entre, tenant son plateau à deux
          mains. Elle se dirige vers le lit, sur lequel Gabriel est affalé,
          tout habillé. Il a même encore ses chaussures ! Il a juste rabattu
          le couvre lit en partie sur lui, et surtout sur sa tête. Marie-Jo
          s'arrête devant le lit.
                          MARIE-JO
           Monsieur ?
                         
          Gabriel se retourne lentement, découvrant son visage, encore
          bouffi de sommeil... Il regarde le plateau d'un air un peu
          dégoûté.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Ohhh non ! Pas ça ! Montez-moi un Vichy.
                         
          Marie-Jo se retourne et se dirige vers la porte.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Hé !...
                         
          Marie-Jo s'arrête et se retourne. Gabriel s'assoit sur le lit, les
          jambes pendantes par-dessus la rambarde au pied du lit.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Qu'est-ce qu'on raconte dans la maison ?
                         
                          MARIE-JO
           A propos de quoi ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Hier soir.
                         
                          MARIE-JO
           Oh, Monsieur Quentin, y parle jamais de ces choses-là,
           hein. Pour lui, hier, c'est hier.
                         
          Gabriel regarde Marie-Jo, les bras croisés.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Et aujourd'hui, c'est aujourd'hui. Votre patron personnifie
           le bon sens. Bon, je descends.
                         
          Il descend lentement du lit. Marie-Jo sort de la chambre et
          referme la porte derrière elle.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - VESTIBULE DE RÉCEPTION - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          La porte d'entrée est ouverte, et on aperçoit la voiture d'Albert,
          garée devant l'hôtel. Albert entre portant un cageot de rougets.
          Il longe l'escalier, et entre par l'autre porte de la salle à
          manger, située derrière l'escalier. Dans la pièce, on aperçoit
          Suzanne, les mains sur les hanches, qui regarde les quatre cageots
          de rougets déjà empilés par terre ! Derrière Suzanne, les portes
          des chambres froides.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Mais t'es complètement fou. Qu'est-ce qu'on va faire de
           tout ça ?
                         
          Albert pose le dernier cageot sur la table. Sur la droite du
          champ, on aperçoit Gabriel qui descend l'escalier.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           J'en sais rien, mais je veux pas me laisser emmerder par
           Monsieur Esnault.
          Il ouvre la porte d'une chambre froide, au moment où Gabriel
          s'encadre dans la porte ouvert de l'office.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et l'autre, il est descendu ?
                         
          Il se retourne et voit Gabriel.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - SALLE À MANGER - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Albert est debout devant la porte ouverte de la chambre froide,
          dans laquelle, posés sur des étagères, on aperçoit des bouteilles,
          du lait, des yaourts.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Vous avez besoin de quelque chose, Monsieur Fouquet ?
                         
          Il ouvre une autre porte de la chambre froide.
                         
          La caméra est maintenant placée dans la chambre froide. On voit
          Albert par la porte qui vient de s'ouvrir, et Gabriel par la porte
          déjà ouverte. Gabriel s'approche d'Albert.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je voulais vous demander pour hier soir...
                         
          Albert fait de la place dans la chambre froide pour y déposer ses
          poissons. Il enlève des plats vides.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Me demander quoi ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           J'ai pas fait trop de foin ?
                         
          Albert pose les plats vides sur la table
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Non, pas trop.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Tant mieux. On a beaucoup bavardé. J'ai pourtant pas la
           mémoire des noms, mais y en a un qui m'est resté gravé
           là...
                         
          Il désigne sa tempe.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           ... le Yang-Tsé-Kiang.
                         
          Albert ouvre une troisième porte, découvrant Suzanne, qui regarde
          Gabriel, le visage inquiet, puis se tourne vers Albert.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           J'ai toujours retenu les choses compliquées, comme
           anticonstitutionnellement... la dictée de Mérimée, les rois
           d'Égypte. J'y ajouterai le Yang-Tsé-Kiang.
                         
          Albert dépose un plat contenant des rougets sur une étagère de la
          chambre froide. Marie-Jo passe derrière eux, portant le plateau du
          petit-déjeuner de Gabriel. Suzanne regarde l'intérieur de la
          chambre froide sans la voir, les yeux dans le vague. Albert
          referme la troisième porte de la chambre froide, cachant Suzanne.
          Il pose un autre plat de rougets sur une étagère.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Monsieur Fouquet, je m'excuse, mais y a des heures pour
           bavarder et des heures pour travailler.
                         
          Il referme la porte, disparaissant à notre vue. Seule reste
          ouverte la porte derrière laquelle Gabriel est toujours debout,
          les mains dans les poches.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Oh, moi, les heures, vous savez... Le principal, c'est que
           je vous aie pas contrarié.
                         
          Albert referme la dernière porte.
                         
          Plan moyen sur Albert fermant la porte de la chambre froide, avec
          Suzanne derrière lui, qui l'observe, le regard inquiet.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ohhh ! Rassurez-vous. Pour me contrarier, faut se lever de
           bonne heure, ou se coucher beaucoup plus tard.
                         
          Il tire un cageot de rougets vers lui. Gabriel sourit, se retourne
          et sort de la salle à manger. Suzanne s'approche de la porte et le
          regarde traverser la réception.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - RUE HÔTEL STELLA - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Gabriel sort de l'hôtel, referme la porte, et se dirige vers le
          Café Normand. Il est déjà presque arrivé au café lorsque la porte
          de l'hôtel s'ouvre de nouveau. Suzanne, qui a déjà son écharpe
          autour du cou, sort en enfilant son manteau. Au loin, on voit
          Gabriel qui passe devant le café sans s'arrêter et continue dans
          la rue, disparaissant à nos yeux. Suzanne finit d'enfiler son
          manteau et court vers lui.
                         
          Contrechamp sur Suzanne, qui trottine en enfilant ses gants.
          Lorsqu'elle tourne le coin de la rue, elle se trouve nez à nez
          avec Gabriel qui achète des journaux. Il paie la marchande, qui
          rentre dans sa boutique, sourit et s'approche de Suzanne.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Alors, madame Quentin, on espionne l'aimable clientèle ?
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Monsieur Fouquet...
                         
          Il lui montre le journal qu'il tient à la main.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Les assassins, les voleurs, ils se nourrissent de journaux.
           L'homme traqué est obligé de se tenir au courant de tout.
           Depuis cette manie des portraits-robots, je suis obligé de
           changer de tête tous les jours. Je m'étais fait, je crois,
           hier, la tête de l'homme qui boit. Demain, de quoi sera-t-
           il fait ?...
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Je vois que vous aimez la plaisanterie.
                         
          Il s'éloigne d'elle, et continue sa promenade dans la rue qui
          descend vers la mer. Elle le suit.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Ça vous ennuie que nous fassions quelques pas ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je vous en prie.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Monsieur Fouquet, vous comptez rester longtemps chez nous ?
           Cette question vous surprend peut-être...
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Elle me surprend d'autant moins que votre mari me l'a déjà
           posée hier soir.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Et qu'est-ce que vous lui avez répondu ?
                         
          Gabriel sort une cigarette d'un paquet et la met dans sa bouche.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Que j'en savais rien.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Ah !... Remarquez, si vous devez rester que deux ou trois
           jours, je n'ai rien à vous dire, mais si vous comptez
           rester davantage...
                         
          Gabriel allume sa cigarette. Suzanne s'arrête de marcher, et
          Gabriel s'arrête aussi.
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Comment vous expliquer ?... Cette nuit, Albert vous a parlé
           du Yang-Tsé-Kiang. Et ben, il faut pas, c'est mauvais pour
           lui.
                         
          Elle se remet en marche, et Gabriel aussi.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - PLAGE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Il sont arrivé en bordure de mer. Le temps est très brumeux, et on
          distingue à peine la mer.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Vous devez me prendre pour une folle. Je voulais pas vous
           dire ça comme ça.
                         
          Gabriel saute sur un banc.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Monsieur Fouquet, nous sommes un ménage heureux, foutez-
           nous la paix.
          Du haut du banc, il se penche vers elle.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           C'est ça, la formule brutale ?
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Oui...
                         
          Gabriel descend du banc, et s'approche de la rambarde qui
          surplombe la plage. Suzanne le rejoint.
                         
          Plan rapproché de Gabriel appuyé des deux mains sur la rambarde.
          Suzanne s'accoude sur la rambarde, et regarde Gabriel, qui ne la
          regarde pas, mais regarde au loin vers la mer embrumée.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Je voudrais que vous compreniez. Albert est devenu parfait.
           J'ai peur que vous lui redonniez le goût des voyages. Il
           pourrait penser que vous allez en Chine sans lui.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           En Espagne, madame.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Pardon ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Moi, c'est l'Espagne.
                         
          Il se tourne vers elle.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Voyez, vous pouvez dormir tranquille.
                         
          Il s'éloigne de la rambarde. Suzanne reste songeuse et
                         BREDOUILLE :
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Évidemment, si c'est l'Espagne...
                         
          Gabriel descend, par un escalier, vers la plage, loin en
          contrebas. Suzanne se penche par-dessus la rambarde qui surplombe
          l'escalier.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Monsieur Fouquet, sans indiscrétion, vous êtes venu à
           Tigreville pourquoi ?
                         
          Gabriel s'arrête à mi-chemin dans l'escalier et relève la tête
          vers elle.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Pour vous reposer ? Pour vos affaires ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Pour achat, je cherche un magasin de confection. Vous
           connaissez ça ?
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Euh... Ça dépend... Pour homme ou pour femme ?
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Pour fillette.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Et ben, vous pourriez aller chez Landru. On l'appelle comme
           ça à cause de sa barbe et de ses deux femmes qui sont
           mortes.
                         
          Elle lui indique le chemin de la main.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Vous longez la plage, c'est dans la première rue qui monte.
           « Au Chic Parisien ».
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Merci.
                         
          Gabriel se retourne et reprend sa descente vers la plage.
                         
          Suzanne le regarde partir avec un air songeur. Elle met les mains
          dans ses poches et s'éloigne de la rambarde.

          Chic Parisien ». En plus petit, à droite, il est écrit :
          « Frivolités », et à gauche : « Nouveautés ». Entre la vitrine et
          la porte d'entrée , est accrochée une enseigne publicitaire du
          « Journal de Mickey ». Un zoom arrière nous fait découvrir le
          reste de la devanture. Sur le côté droit de la vitrine, un panneau
          publicitaire des « Laines du Pingouin » voisine avec d'autres
          panneaux plus petits. En vitrine, un assortiment assez hétéroclite
          d'accessoires de plage, de vêtements et autres objets variés.
                         
          Panoramique vers la rue qui remonte de la mer. Gabriel y marche
          d'un pas décidé, venant vers le magasin.
          Il ouvre la porte, constellée de cartes postales, que l'on voit à
          travers la vitre. Sur la partie basse de la porte, où il n'y a pas
          de vitre, une gros panneau publicitaire de « Pierrot Gourmand ».
                         
          AU CHIC PARISIEN - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          L'intérieur du magasin a un aspect de « caverne d'Ali Baba », où
          les jouets voisinent avec les vêtements, les cartes postales, les
          ustensiles de cuisine, des roues de vélo, des masques de carnaval,
          un arrosoir...
                         
          Gabriel entre et referme la porte derrière lui. On entend des
          bruits, puis une voix qui dit :
                         
           LANDRU (voix off)
           Blanchette...
                         
          Gabriel fait deux pas dans la boutique.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Y a quelqu'un ?
          Dans un miroir, on voit le propriétaire des lieux qui s'approche,
          tenant un lapin blanc dans les bras.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Ma Blanchette, petite coquine ! Hein ? Tu t'es échappée !
                         
          « Landru » se dirige vers un grand clapier contenant d'autres
          lapins. Il est chauve avec une couronne de cheveux sur l'arrière
          du crâne, et une grande barbe qui le fait, en effet, ressembler
          vaguement au célèbre assassin de femmes.
                         
          A côté du clapier, deux grandes caisses, sur lesquelles sont
          inscrits, en lettres majuscules : « Matériel pour Feux
          d'Artifice » et « Danger Explosifs ». Et, à côté, une malle
          métallique, marqué « Fougasse Marrons ».
                         
                          LANDRU
           C'est pas gentil, ça, hein ! Allez, va retrouver tes petits
           amis.
                         
          Il va pour déposer le lapin dans le clapier, lorsqu'il entend
          Gabriel toussoter derrière lui. Il se retourne, avec le lapin
          blanc dans les bras.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Vous vouliez quelque chose, monsieur ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je voudrais un vêtement chaud, un pull-over, pour fillette.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Fillette ?...
                         
          Il ouvre le clapier, dépose le lapin à l'intérieur, referme le
          clapier et se tourne vers Gabriel.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Fillette ?... Il y a bien longtemps que je ne fais plus
           dans la fillette. Quel âge ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Dix ans.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Dix ans fort, ou dix ans faible ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Plutôt faible.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Vous ne dites pas ça pour me faire plaisir ?
                         
          Il déplace une échelle.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Parce que, là, j'ai peut-être votre affaire.
                         
          Il grimpe sur l'échelle.
          Gabriel lève les yeux, intrigué par ce que Landru est en train de
          dénicher dans ses réserves supérieures. Landru redescend portant
          un pull-over de taille enfant sur un cintre. Le pull-over, dont on
          ne peut déterminer la couleur (le film est en noir et blanc), est
          décoré d'alignements horizontaux de losanges de couleur sombre,
          sur un fond clair. Il peut s'ouvrir dans sa partie supérieure
          grâce à trois boutons, et il a un petit col de couleur sombre.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Cher monsieur, nous vous attendions depuis trente ans.
                         
          Landru s'est arrêté sur l'un des derniers barreaux de son échelle.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Qui ça, nous ?
                         
                          LANDRU
           Lui et moi.
                         
          Il descend les derniers barreaux.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Regardez-moi ça.
                         
          Il tend le pull à Gabriel, qui l'examine, pendant que Landru va
          ranger son échelle.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           J'ai peur quand même qu'il soit un peu grand.
                         
          Landru, qui a dépose son échelle contre un mur couvert d'étagères,
          se tourne vers lui.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Ah ! Ah ! J'étais sûr que vous croiriez ça. Tout le monde
           croit ça. Vous ne connaissez pas les laines du Queensland ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Non, mais je connais ma fille.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Écoutez-moi bien, monsieur. Non seulement, ce pull-over
           n'est pas trop grand, mais il ne peut pas l'être. Vous ne
           me demandez pas pourquoi ?.... Parce qu'il a été tricoté
           sur mesure pour une naine. Oui, naturellement, Puppy
           Schneider, ça ne vous dit rien ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Ma foi non.
                         
          Landru lui tapote l'épaule, et s'éloigne. Gabriel le suit des
          yeux.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Vous êtes trop jeune.
                         
          Il s'est approché d'un meuble sur lequel sont posés des masques.
          Sur le mur derrière le meuble, une série de photos de mode.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Puppy Schneider... Il n'y en avait que pour elle, dans les
           mondanités des années vingt.
                         
          Il prend l'un des masques sur le meuble, représentant une jeune
          femme coiffé d'un étrange chapeau.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Un millionnaire Américain...
                         
          Il retourne un autre masque, accroché sur un poteau vertical, et
          qui représente un homme avec une grand barbe blanche.
                         
                          LANDRU
           ... Walter Krutchen, l'avait vue dans un cirque et en était
           tombé fou. Les grands hommes ont toujours aimé les petites
           femmes, mais à ce point-là, avouez que c'est rare.
                         
          Gabriel l'écoute en souriant, assis sur l'une des caisses
          d'explosifs.
                         
          Landru repose le masque sur le meuble, et l'autre masque s'est
          retourné tout seul. Il désigne le pull du doigt.
                         
                          LANDRU
           C'est lui qui m'avait commandé ce pull-over, d'après une
           maquette de Van Dongen.
                         
          Il se rapproche de Gabriel.
                         
                          LANDRU
           La-dessus, le krach de Wall Street, en 29. Le Krutchen
           s'est suicidé, comme vous et moi. La Puppy est retournées à
           son cirque, et le pull-over m'est resté sur les bras.
                         
          Il ricane.
                         
                          LANDRU
           C'est pour vous dire que ce n'est pas l'acquisition
           banale... pas le vêtement de tout le monde.
                         
          Gabriel examine le pull de plus prêt.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Mais vous êtes sûr que Puppy Schneider ne l'a pas porté ?
                         
          Il tend la main, comme s'il prêtait serment.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Juré.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Vous avez beaucoup de choses comme ça, qui datent un peu ?
                         
          Landru regarde autour de lui avec des yeux un peu inquiétants.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Des choses insoupçonnables. Ainsi, devinez un peu sur quoi
           vous êtes assis.
                         
          Gabriel se lève d'un bond.
                          LANDRU
           N'ayez pas peur !
                         
          Un chat saute sur la caisse d'explosifs que Gabriel vient de
          quitter, puis disparaît derrière la caisse. Landru ricane.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Le malin !... Encore une commande Walter Krutchen pour
           l'anniversaire de Puppy.
                         
          Il prend le bras de Gabriel et l'entraîne vers le devant de la
          boutique.
                         
                          LANDRU
           De quoi illuminer toute une ville. Pschhh !... Cher
           monsieur, au plaisir.
                         
          Il passe derrière sa caisse et prend le pull des mains de Gabriel.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Et si un jour, vous avez besoin de quoi que ce soit, je dis
           bien de quoi que ce soit...
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je ne commettrai pas la folie de m'adresser ailleurs,
           soyez-en sûr.
                         
          Landru emballe le pull.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Vous ferez porter ma note à l'hôtel Stella.
                         
          Landru donne le paquet à Gabriel.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Ça ne presse pas.
          Gabriel se dirige vers la sortie de la boutique.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Cher monsieur, au plaisir.
                         
          Landru suit Gabriel avec un regard un peu inquiétant.
                         
          AU CHIC PARISIEN - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Gabriel sort du magasin avec son paquet à la main. Il fait trois
          pas dans la rue, mais se retourne car la porte du magasin vient de
          s'ouvrir de nouveau. Landru sort, son chapeau sur la tête, et
          ferme la porte à clef.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Vous fermez déjà ?
                         
                          LANDRU
           Vous m'avez bien dit de porter votre note ? Chose promise,
           chose due.
                         
          Il enlève son chapeau, et s'éloigne vers le centre ville. Gabriel
          sourit et s'éloigne lui aussi.
                         
          UN CHEMIN FORESTIER - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Gabriel marche sur un chemin carrossable, bordé de chaque côté par
          des arbres. Il a toujours ses journaux et le paquet de Landru à la
          main. Sur la droite de Gabriel, à travers la végétation, on
          distingue un grand mur de pierre. Gabriel arrive à un grand
          portail de fer forgé blanc, sur lequel est apposé un écriteau qui
          indique : « Cours Dillon - Externat Internat ». Il tire sur une
          corde qui actionne une cloche. Il regarde, à travers les barreaux
          du portail, un homme qui s'approche de lui en courant. Il s'agit
          de l'homme au béret, qui l'avait, la veille au soir, ramené à son
          hôtel. L'homme regarde Gabriel à travers les barreaux du portail.
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Gabriel !... Ah, ça par exemple ! Qu'est-ce que tu viens
           glander dans nos confins.
                         
          Il ouvre la porte. Gabriel entre et regarde l'homme avec surprise.

                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Nous nous connaissons ?
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Ben, ma parole, t'étais encore plus rond que je ne
           pensais ! Tu te rappelles pas ? C'est moi qui t'ai mis dans
           le train.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Cette nuit ?
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Oui...
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je vois... Bon, et bien, je voudrais pas abuser deux fois
           de votre obligeance.
                         
          Il met ses journaux sous son bras et tend le paquet à l'homme.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Soyez bien aimable de remettre ce paquet...
                         
          L'homme écarte les bras pour ne pas toucher au paquet.
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Ah non, je me ferais engueuler. Tiens, adresse-toi là-bas.
                         
          Il lui montre une imposante bâtisse du XVIII° siècle au bout de
          l'allée. Une femme vient vers eux. Gabriel et l'homme marchent à
          sa rencontre.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Pour les histoires de train, j'aimerais pouvoir compter sur
           la... enfin sur ta discrétion.
                         
          Il lui tend un billet, que l'autre ne prend pas.
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Ah non, mon cochon ! Crois pas t'en tirer comme ça...
                         
          Il baisse la voix, car la femme est presque arrivée près d'eux.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Tu paieras ta tournée ce soir.
                         
          Il s'éloigne. La femme, qui est l'infirmière de l'école en
          général, et l'infirmière personnelle de la directrice en
          particulier, et qui se prénomme Georgette, toise Gabriel. Elle
          porte un uniforme de nurse anglaise : grande cape noire et coiffe
          noire avec voile couvrant toute la chevelure, avec seulement une
          petite bordure blanche sur le front.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Monsieur, le personnel ne doit accepter aucun pourboire.
           Que puis-je pour vous ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Si vous voulez bien remettre ce paquet à la petite Marie
           Fouquet.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Voulez-vous me suivre au parloir.
                         
          Elle fait demi-tour pour retourner vers le bâtiment. Gabriel la
          suit.
                         
          COURS DILLON - HALL D'ENTRÉE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Hall de dimensions imposantes, avec un grand escalier de bois
          montant vers les étages. Un grand lustre en fer forgé pend au
          milieu du hall. Un groupe de petite filles, portant toutes la même
          blouse grise serrée à la taille, traverse le hall sous la conduite
          d'une maîtresse strictement habillée et au chignon impeccable.
          Elles montent l'escalier. Une grande porte vitrée, à l'extrémité
          du hall, s'ouvre, laissant entrer Georgette, suivie de Gabriel.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Entrez.
                         
          Elle referme la porte derrière Gabriel et traverse le hall, suivie
          par Gabriel.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Je crois que votre visite fera plaisir à tout le monde.
           Nous commencions à craindre que cette petite Fouquet soit
           complètement oubliée. Vous permettez ?
                         
          Elle s'arrête au milieu du hall, lui prend le paquet des mains, et
          reprend son chemin.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Nous vérifions tous les colis destinés aux pensionnaires.
           Vérification symbolique, bien sûr.
                         
          Elle monte l'escalier d'un pas rapide, puis s'arrête net au bout
          de cinq ou six marches. Elle se retourne et regarde Gabriel qui
          est resté debout au milieu du hall.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           C'est drôle, je vous voyais plus âgé. Marie a de la chance
           d'avoir un papa aussi jeune.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Oui, mais je ne suis pas son père. Je suis un cousin...
           cousin éloigné.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Ah !... Tant pis, je vais quand même la chercher. Si vous
           voulez bien attendre.
                         
          Elle fait deux pas dans l'escalier
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Non...
                         
          La femme s'arrête et se retourne de nouveau vers Gabriel.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je voudrais pas la déranger dans son travail.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Ça lui arrive si rarement.
                         
          Une voix, provenant d'une pièce donnant sur le hall, appelle :
                         
           MADAME VICTORIA (voix off)
           Georgette !
                         
          Georgette se retourne vers l'endroit d'où provient la voix.
                         
          Plan rapproché sur une double porte battante donnant sur le hall.
                         
           MADAME VICTORIA (voix off)
           What's happening ? I don't want to be disturbed. I am
           working.
           (Traduction : Que se passe-t-il ? Je ne veux pas être
           dérangée. Je travaille.)
                         
          Retour sur Georgette, toujours debout sur les marches de
          l'escalier, le paquet de Gabriel à la main. Elle se penche vers le
          hall.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Nothing at all, madam !
           (Traduction : Rien du tout, madame.)
                         
          Elle chuchote en direction de Gabriel.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           C'est madame la directrice.
                         
          Gabriel, toujours debout au milieu du hall, la regarde et
          chuchote, lui aussi :
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je ne savais pas qu'elle était anglaise.
          Sans bouger de l'escalier, Georgette lui répond, toujours en
          chuchotant.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Elle ne l'est pas : elle fait semblant.
                         
          Elle redescend vers Gabriel.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Il y a dix ans, elle s'est mis dans la tête de parler
           anglais.
                         
          Elle a rejoint Gabriel, à qui elle parle à voix basse.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Sans doute pour faire bien, pour épater les parents
           d'élève. Le plus beau, c'est qu'il a fallu que je m'y mette
           aussi, sans ça, où est-ce qu'on allait. Les questions
           étaient anglaises et mes réponses françaises.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           C'est ce qui a perdu Jeanne d'Arc.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Ah oui, sûrement... Si je vous disais, monsieur, que j'ai
           soigné, pendant dix ans, le Général Marvier, héros du Bec
           d'Ambès. J'ai fermé les yeux d'un sénateur-maire de la Côte
           d'Or, mon dévouement a permis à la grande Magda Golovina de
           remonter sur scène.
                         
          Elle pointe son doigt sur la poitrine de Gabriel.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Et bien, monsieur, j'affirme que je n'ai jamais payé de ma
           personne comme auprès de Madame Victoria... Jamais !
                         
          Les deux battants de la porte s'ouvrent devant un fauteuil
          roulant, sur lequel la directrice est assise. Elle est habillée
          tout de noir, et ressemble un peu à une vieille dame anglaise dans
          le style de la Miss Marple d'Agatha Christie.
                         
                          MADAME VICTORIA
           What are you doing ? Speaking alone ?...
           (Traduction : Qu'est-ce que vous faites ? Vous parlez toute
           seule ?)
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Madame...
                         
          La directrice se tourne vers lui et le toise d'un regard peu
          aimable.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           This gentleman is a relative of Marie Fouquet.
           (Traduction : Ce monsieur est un parent de Marie Fouquet.)
                         
          La directrice se retourne vers Georgette.
                         
                          MADAME VICTORIA
           Well... What are you waiting for ? Go and fetch the girl.
           (Traduction : Et bien... Qu'est-ce que vous attendez ?
           Allez chercher la fillette.)
                         
          Georgette contourne la chaise roulante et monte l'escalier, le
          paquet de Gabriel dans les mains. Tout en montant, elle se tourne
          vers Gabriel.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Je vous demande deux minutes.
                         
          La directrice retourne son fauteuil roulant vers la double porte
          battante, qui s'ouvre sous la poussée du fauteuil.
                         
          Gabriel la regarde sortir. Il semble songeur. Il fait quelques pas
          dans le hall. Il s'approche d'une grande baie vitrée et regarde
          dans le parc. Puis, après quelques instants de réflexion, il prend
          une décision soudaine et se dirige, à grandes enjambées, vers la
          porte du hall. Il ouvre la porte, sort dehors, et referme la porte
          derrière lui.
                         
          Contrechamp en contre-plongée vers la galerie du premier étage.
          Marie Fouquet, en blouse d'uniforme, et un grand sourire aux
          lèvres, court sur la galerie, puis descend l'escalier quatre à
          quatre. Elle porte, sur son bras, le pull que son père lui a
          offert. Elle s'arrête au bout de quelques marches, et inspecte le
          hall.
                         
          Le hall, vu en plongée, est totalement vide.
                         
          Marie, toujours debout sur une marche, semble très triste. On sent
          que ses larmes sont prêtes à sortir. Elle se retourne et remonte
          lentement l'escalier.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - CAVE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          La cave est plus propre, plus lumineuse, et mieux rangée que
          pendant la guerre. Les étagères son pleines de bouteilles. Suzanne
          et Albert sont en train d'inspecter les bouteilles, chacun sur une
          étagère différente. Ils sont dos à dos. Albert porte un tablier et
          a un crayon et un carnet en main.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Je sais pas ce qu'ils ont, mais ils se sont tous jetés sur
           le Bordeaux, cette année. Fais-moi donc penser à téléphoner
           à Courtine.
                         
          Suzanne se retourne avec une bouteille en main. Elle a une lueur
          inquiète dans le regard.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Albert...
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Hmm...
                         
          Elle marque un léger temps avant de continuer.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           ... je voudrais pas que tu prennes ça mal, mais tu sais, à
           force de vivre ensemble... je sais pas, moi, mais... on
           finit par deviner certaines choses, par sentir euh...
                         
          Elle va pour remettre la bouteille sur l'étagère.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Sentir quoi ?
                         
          Elle se retourne, toujours la bouteille en main.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Oh... Rien de précis, c'est seulement une idée... Mais
           depuis quatre jours, j'ai l'impression que t'es plus tout à
           fait le même. Depuis que monsieur Fouquet est là, tu te
           rends pas compte, mais...
                         
          Albert, qui partait avec un cageot de bouteilles dans les mains,
          se retourne vers sa femme. Il a mis le crayon et le carnet dans la
          poche pectorale de sa chemise.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ah !...
                         
          Il pose le cageot sur un autre cageot.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Nous y voilà. Ma bonne Suzanne, tu viens de commettre ton
           premier faux pas. Y a des femmes qui révèlent à leur mari
           toute une vie d'infidélité, mais toi, tu viens de m'avouer
           quinze années de soupçons, c'est pire.
                         
          Il reprend son cageot et traverse la cave.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Note bien que tu as peut-être raison.
                         
          Il pose le cageot un peu plus loin. Suzanne l'a suivi.
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Qui a bu boira. Ça, faut reconnaître qu'on a le proverbe
           contre nous. Rassure-toi,va, je plaisante.
                         
          Il ricane. Mais Suzanne garde un visage fermé et légèrement
          inquiet.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Qu'est-ce que tu veux qu'il m'arrive ? J'ai une femme qui
           veille sur moi, un métier qui m'occupe, et des bonbons pour
           me distraire, alors...
                         
          Il s'éloigne d'elle.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           D'ailleurs, je vais peut-être les supprimer, les bonbons.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Pourquoi ? Quand une habitude n'est pas mauvaise...
                         
          Elle suit Albert à travers la cave, et pose, au passage, la
          bouteille, qu'elle tenait en main, dans un cageot. Albert arrive
          au pied de l'escalier.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh, y a pas de bonnes habitudes. L'habitude, c'est une
           façon de mourir sur place.
                         
          Il monte l'escalier, Suzanne le suit.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - VESTIBULE DE RÉCEPTION - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Gabriel, en costume et cravate, parle au téléphone, debout et
          accoudé sur le comptoir de réception.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Projet de sketch pour une publicité jumelée... sous-
           vêtements et lessive. Bon, vous y êtes ?...
                         
          Il lit un papier qu'il a posé sur le comptoir.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           En scène, Richelieu...
                         
          Derrière lui, Albert et Suzanne entre par la porte de la cave.
          Albert porte toujours son tablier.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Ben oui, évidemment, le Cardinal !... Il écoute les propos
           d'un capucin barbu qui lui parle à l'oreille. Soudain
           jaillit des coulisse un athlète, vêtu d'un slip immaculé.
                         
          Albert et Suzanne passe derrière lui, se dirigeant vers la salle à
          manger. Albert enlève son tablier, et Suzanne regarde Gabriel, un
          peu étonnée par ses propos surprenants.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Il renvoie d'un geste son conseiller, et désigne l'athlète
           au public en déclarant : « Je croyais que mon éminence
           était grise, mais le sien a la blancheur Persil »...
          HOTEL STELLA - SALLE À MANGER - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Albert et Suzanne se sont installés à leur table, près des
          chambres froides. Sur la table trône une soupière et, à côté de la
          soupière, une bouteille de Vittel. Albert pousse la soupière vers
          Suzanne.
                         
           GABRIEL FOUQUET (voix off)
           Oui, évidemment, ça manque un peu de femmes, mais enfin, on
           verra, hein.
                         
          Pendant que Suzanne se sert de la soupe, Albert regarde en
          direction de Gabriel.
                         
          Contrechamp sur Gabriel, toujours accoudé au comptoir de
          réception, et vu à travers la porte ouverte de la salle à manger.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Bon. Deuxième projet. Pâtes Lustucru à traiter en dessin
           animé. Un chat tente de s'introduire dans une marmite
           pleine de spaghettis.
          Albert regarde toujours Gabriel, puis il tourne la tête vers
          Suzanne qui se sert de la soupe.
                         
           GABRIEL FOUQUET (voix off)
           Surgit le père Lustucru, armé d'une louche. Dialogue.
                         
          Nouveau contrechamp sur Gabriel, vu à travers la porte de la salle
          à manger. Il a maintenant pris son papier en main, et continue à
          le lire.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Le père Lustucru : « A bas les pattes ! » Le chat, avec un
           grand sourire...
                         
          Retour sur Suzanne qui se sert de la soupe, et Albert, qui regarde
          Gabriel.
                         
           GABRIEL FOUQUET (voix off)
           ... « A bas les pattes, sauf les pâtes Lustucru. » Je
           compte sur vous pour fignoler les voix, un peu détimbrée
           pour Lustucru...
                         
          Contrechamp sur Gabriel.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           ... avec beaucoup d'écho... C'est ça, au revoir.
                         
          Il raccroche le téléphone, puis entre dans la salle à manger, et
          se dirige vers sa table. Il n'y a d'ailleurs que deux tables
          dressées dans la salle, chacune à une extrémité de la salle. Celle
          de Gabriel, près de la fenêtre, et celle des patrons, près des
          chambres froides. Toutes les autres tables sont vides et n'ont
          même pas de nappe. Gabriel s'assoit à table et déplie sa
          serviette. Sur sa table, à côté de son couvert, une bouteille de
          vin. Marie-Jo arrive de la cuisine, portant une soupière, qu'elle
          pose sur la table de Gabriel. Elle s'éloigne et Gabriel se sert de
          la soupe.
          Contrechamp sur la table d'Albert et Suzanne, qui mangent leur
          soupe.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           C'est quand même triste un jeune homme seul devant sa
           soupe.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Bien sûr que c'est triste. Seulement, si je l'invite, tu
           diras encore que je manigance des trucs.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Ne parlons plus de ça, va.
                         
          Elle relève la tête et appelle.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Monsieur Fouquet !... Nous n'aurons plus de client à cette
           heure-là, si ça vous ennuie pas de venir à notre table.
                         
          Gabriel regarde Suzanne, puis il se lève et prend sa bouteille de
          vin.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Avec plaisir, chère madame.
                         
          Il traverse la salle, prend une chaise au passage, et l'installe
          en face d'Albert et Suzanne. Il montre la bouteille qu'il tient à
          la main.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Vous permettez ?
                         
          Il s'assoit et Albert se lève.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ah non. Hé, vous êtes notre invité, hein.
                         
          Il prend la bouteille de Gabriel et se dirige vers la cuisine.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Marie-Jo, mettez donc un couvert à monsieur Fouquet, là.
                         
          Il disparaît dans la cuisine. Marie-Jo, qui faisait la plonge, se
          dirige vers la salle. Gabriel se penche vers Suzanne.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Alors, quand on veut conjurer le diable, on l'invite à sa
           table.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Je ne vois pas ce que vous voulez dire, monsieur Fouquet.
                         
          Albert sort de la cuisine, une bonne bouteille à la main.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Tenez, vous allez me goûter ça.
                         
          Il pose la bouteille sur la table.
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ma femme vous tiendra compagnie.
                         
          Il s'assoit à table.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Marie-Jo !
                         
           MARIE-JO (voix off en provenance de la cuisine)
           Oui, monsieur.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Venez donc ouvrir la bouteille, là.
                         
          Il prend la bouteille d'eau minérale et s'en sert un verre, sous
          le regard un peu absent de sa femme, qui gratte inconsciemment la
          nappe.
                         
          Fondu enchaîné.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - PLAGE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
          Marée basse. Plan moyen sur une vieille femme qui, en bordure de
          mer, est en train de ramasser des coquillages dans le sable. Elle
          les dépose dans un cageot. A côté d'elle, une vieille poussette de
          bébé, qui lui sert à transporter son cageot.
                         
          Panoramique sur la plage, où deux autres personnes ramassent aussi
          des coquillages. Il s'agit d'Albert et Gabriel.
                         
          Plan moyen sur eux deux. Gabriel, vêtu d'un blouson de cuir avec
          col de mouton, a les deux pieds dans l'eau, et un grand panier
          plat à la main. Albert, lui, est vêtu d'une canadienne à col de
          fourrure. Il est sur le sable sec et creuse le sable avec ses
          mains pour en extraire les coquillages. Gabriel revient vers
          Albert.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Que ce soit la révolution ou la paella, dites-vous bien que
           rien de ce qui est Espagnol n'est simple.
                         
          Il est arrivé près d'Albert, qui se relève. Il lui montre son
          panier. Albert ramasse son propre panier et ils se mettent en
          marche côte à côte sur la plage.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Une paella sans coquillage, c'est un gigot sans ail, un
           escroc sans rosette, quelque chose qui déplait à Dieu. Au
           temps de mes amours, je confectionnais la paella comme
           personne. Claire me reconnaissait ce talent. J'espère que
           mes déboires ne m'auront pas gâté la main.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Pourquoi buvez-vous ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           La question m'a déjà été posée, monsieur le Proviseur.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Probablement par des gens qui vous aiment bien.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Probablement. Claire me la posait trois fois par semaine,
           elle devait m'adorer. Je croyais que vous étiez un homme
           ennemi des questions.
                         
          Ils croisent la vieille femme, qui traîne sa poussette sur la
          plage. Albert s'arrête de marcher.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           C'est exact, je préfère les réponses.
                         
          Ils sont arrivés devant un endroit où de nombreux petits piquets
          sont plantés dans le sable. Il s'agit de « bouchots », qui sont
          découverts seulement à marée basse, et sur lesquels s'accrochent
          les moules.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           C'est curieux, Claire aussi. « Gabriel, m'aimez-vous ? »
           « Gabriel, pourquoi buvez-vous ? » «Croyez-vous que ce soit
           raisonnable de vous mettre dans cet état-là ? » Sous
           prétexte de vous empêcher de boire, leur rêve, ce serait de
           nous mettre en bouteille.
                         
          Il s'avance entre les bouchots.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ohh... je crois simplement qu'elles ont la trouille.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           La trouille de quoi ? J'ai jamais eu le vin mauvais, plutôt
           affectueux, même grotesque.
                         
          Il pose son panier par terre.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           J'avais, en tout cas, le charme de l'imprévu.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh la-la ! Alors, là, vous êtes complètement à côté, elles
           aiment les valeurs sûres.
                         
          Lui aussi pose son panier au milieu des bouchots. Il ramasse des
          moules collées sur les bouchots et les jette dans son panier.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Attendre un homme et en voir arriver un autre, elles ont
           horreur de ça, d'autant plus que la surprise est rarement
           bonne, faut être juste. Non, croyez-moi, allez, j'ai des
           souvenirs sur la question. Je la vois d'ici, votre Claire,
           avec vos trente-six manières d'arriver saoul. Vous avez dû
           lui foutre le vertige.
                         
          Gabriel, lui aussi, ramasse des moules sur les bouchots, et les
          jette dans son panier.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Possible.
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ben, c'est certain. Notez bien que tout ça ne me regarde
           pas. J'ai peut-être un peu usé de mon droit d'ancienneté.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Y a pas de mal, j'ai toujours fait plus jeune que mon âge.
           N'empêche que j'ai une fille de dix ans.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Alors, là, vous êtes con.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Cette fois, vous abusez.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Quand on a un enfant, y a des choses qu'on n'a pas le droit
           de faire. Comment s'appelle-t-elle ?
                         
          Gabriel ramasse son panier et se rapproche d'Albert
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Marie. J'étais venu ici pour la chercher, et puis...
          Il fait un geste vague de la main. Albert ramasse son panier. Ils
          sortent tous deux du parc à bouchots et se remettent en marche sur
          la plage.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Elle est pensionnaire au cours Dillon. Dites-moi, monsieur
           Quentin, puisqu'on en était aux indiscrétions, lorsque vous
           étiez en Chine, vous fumiez l'opium ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ohhh... Y a rien d'indiscret. Oui, ça m'est arrivé, à
           Shanghaï, à Hong-Kong... Mais rien de bien extraordinaire.
           On rêvassait.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Vous n'aimiez pas rêver ?
                         
          Albert s'arrête de marcher. Gabriel aussi.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ben, ça dépend de la qualité des choses. Là, c'était des
           rêves de fusilier-marin. L'amiral Guépratte m'embrassait
           sur l'oreille, ou bien le thé avait un goût d'anisette. Des
           petits délires grisants, sans plus.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Et maintenant ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Maintenant, il m'arrive de rêver que je fume, ça doit être
           le retour d'âge.
                         
          On entend des cris d'enfants dans le lointain. Les deux hommes
          tournent la tête vers ces rires.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Tiens ! Voilà le cours Dillon.
          Contrechamp en plan général sur la plage. On voit arriver le
          groupe de fillettes, toutes vêtues du même manteau de couleur
          sombre, des mêmes chaussettes blanches, et de la même jupe
          écossaise. Derrière elles, une rangée de belles maisons normandes
          en bordure de plage. Elles sont menée par une maîtresse en manteau
          gris.
                         
          Albert récupère le panier de Gabriel.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Allez, je vous laisse en famille.
                         
          Il s'éloigne. Gabriel fait quelques pas vers la mer. Il prend une
          petite flasque vide dans la poche arrière de son pantalon.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Et une bouteille à la mer !
                         
          Il lance la flasque dans l'eau.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Vous verrez, monsieur Fouquet, un jour, vous finirez par
           rêver que vous buvez.
                         
          Il se retourne et s'éloigne, avec un panier dans chaque main.
                         
          Un peu plus loin sur la plage, le groupe de fillettes est en train
          de jouer près d'un blockhaus. Deux petites filles se détachent du
          groupe, l'une courant après l'autre. Celle de derrière finit par
          rattraper celle de devant, qui n'est autre que Marie, la fille de
          Gabriel, et la plaque dans le sable. Les deux filles commencent à
          se battre. La maîtresse se détache du groupe et vient vers elles.
                         
                          LA MAÎTRESSE
           Marie Fouquet, assez !
                         
          Les deux filles arrêtent de se battre, se relèvent et se dirigent
          vers la maîtresse.
                         
                          LA MAÎTRESSE
           Voulez-vous venir ici tout de suite ! Qu'est-ce que c'est
           que ces manières ? Jouez par ici.
                         
          Gabriel arrive en courant, mais trop tard : les deux filles ont
          déjà rejoint la maîtresse. Il contourne le blockhaus.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - BLOCKHAUS SUR LA PLAGE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Gabriel entre dans le blockhaus par une ouverture irrégulière,
          probablement faite par un explosif. Derrière lui, par l'ouverture,
          on aperçoit les fillettes qui continuent à jouer. Gabriel se cache
          derrière l'un des pans de mur déchiquetés, qui bordent l'entrée,
          et ce afin de ne pas être vu par les fillettes. Les filles se
          rassemblent un cours instant autour de la maîtresse, qui dit :
                         
                          LA MAÎTRESSE
           C'est parti !
                         
          Puis les filles s'éparpillent comme une volée de moineaux,
          accompagnées de la maîtresse. Seule Marie reste au milieu de la
          plage, les yeux fermés. Deux filles courent vers le blockhaus.
          Gabriel s'enfonce vers l'intérieur du blockhaus, puis il se cache
          derrière un pan de mur. Les deux filles entrent et se cachent
          chacune d'un côté de l'entrée.
                         
                          MARIE FOUQUET
           Deux, trois, quatre, cinq ! Ça y est !
                         
          Elle ouvre les yeux et se retourne. La maîtresse vient vers elle,
          déplie un siège pliant, et s'assoit dessus. Marie court vers le
          blockhaus, et lorsqu'elle arrive devant, elle s'arrête et met ses
          mains en porte-voix.
                         
                          MARIE FOUQUET
           Défense de se cacher dans le blockhaus !
                         
          Puis elle part en courant sur la gauche.
                         
                          PREMIÈRE FILLETTE
           Tu parles d'une andouille.
          Plan rapproché sur le visage de Gabriel, qui sort
          précautionneusement de sa cachette.
                         
           DEUXIÈME FILLETTE (voix off)
           La prochaine fois, on a qu'à la semer en route.
                         
           PREMIÈRE FILLETTE (voix off)
           Laisse-la faire, ça lui fera les pieds... Allez, on y va ?
                         
           DEUXIÈME FILLETTE (voix off)
           Et si elle est encore là ?
                         
          Retour sur les deux fillettes.
                         
                          PREMIÈRE FILLETTE
           On dira qu'elle triche, ça la fera pleurer.
                         
          Elles se faufilent lestement en dehors du blockhaus. La maîtresse,
          absorbée par la lecture d'un livre, ne semble pas s'apercevoir de
          leur présence.
                         
          Gabriel sort lentement de sa cachette. Il regarde vers la mer avec
          de la tristesse dans les yeux.
                         
          Fondu enchainé.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - SALLE À MANGER - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Toutes la salle à manger à été nettoyée et rangée. Toutes les
          chaises sont posées à l'envers sur les tables. Seule, la grande
          table ronde au fond de la salle, près des chambres froides, est
          dressée. Albert, Suzanne et Gabriel sont en train de terminer la
          paella préparée par Gabriel. Albert chante.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           On l'appelait le Dénicheur ! Il était rusé comme une
           fouine. C'était un gars qu'avait pas peur, et qui
           connaissait les combines. Le soir, sur les boul'
           extérieurs, quand on voyait passer sa dame, on s'écriait
           sur toutes les gammes : « Ça, ben, c'est la femme à
           Dénicheur ».
                         
          Il s'arrête de chanter.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ah, dans ce temps-là, hein...
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           ... on savait faire les chansons.
                         
          Elle semble légèrement « pompette » ! A côté d'elle, une bouteille
          de vin dans un seau à glace.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Hé oui !
                         
          Marie-Jo passe derrière Suzanne, et ramasse la grande sauteuse,
          qui contenait la paella.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Monsieur Fouquet, votre paella est une splendeur. Ah, celle
           qui vous épousera aura de la chance.
                         
          Elle finit son verre de vin.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je crains, malheureusement, chère madame, qu'on ne
           s'attache pas une femme avec des vertus culinaires...
                         
          Il prend la bouteille dans le seau et ressert Suzanne.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           ... avec des vertus d'aucune sorte, d'ailleurs.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Moi, je dis qu'on peut très bien apprécier les hommages
           déposés dans un plat.
                         
          Gabriel se sert à son tour. Suzanne se tourne vers son mari.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Si Albert avait daigné un jour faire la cuisine pour moi
           toute seule, j'aurais considéré ça comme un madrigal.
                         
          Gabriel repose la bouteille dans le seau. Suzanne porte son verre
          à ses lèvres.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Mais il m'a jamais offert même une omelette.
                         
          Elle boit. Gabriel la regarde en souriant.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ben, qu'est-ce que tu racontes ? D'octobre en avril, on est
           à peu près seuls. Alors, tu peux considérer que, pendant
           six mois de l'année, je ne fais la tambouille que pour te
           rendre hommage ?
          Suzanne le regarde avec le sourire un peu niais de quelqu'un qui a
          un peu trop bu. Gabriel boit lentement son verre.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           C'est vrai.
                         
          Elle se tourne vers Gabriel.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Au fond, c'est beau. Monsieur Fouquet ?... Vous connaissez
           La Bourboule ?
                         
          Gabriel baisse son verre en souriant.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Ma foi, non.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Et ben, vous avez tort. C'est là que j'ai connu Albert. Il
           était en permission libérable. Il portait un blazer à
           rayures, et un canotier... avec ruban assorti. Bel homme,
           et il le savait.
          Marie-Jo vient débarrasser les assiettes.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           C'était le début de la Biguine. Tu te rappelles le disque
           de Dranem ?
                         
          Elle se met à chanter en tapotant sur la table. Gabriel sourit.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           C'est la biguine, il n'y a rien de plus coquin.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Suzanne !
                         
          Il semble un peu gêné.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Oh pourquoi ! Y a pas de mal. On est que tous les trois.
           C'était en juillet, y avait des mimosas. Tu portais des
           bottines de toile. Je m'en rappelle comme si c'était hier.
                         
          Elle se tourne vers Gabriel.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Vous voyez, moi, j'aurais bien aimé une auberge dans le
           midi, mais Albert a pas voulu. Il a voulu qu'on s'installe
           ici à cause du mauvais temps, pour qu'il y ait moins de
           monde, vous voyez ce que c'est que la séduction. C'est
           drôle que vous ne connaissiez pas La Bourboule, un homme
           comme vous.
                         
          Elle ricane niaisement et reprend une gorgée de son verre. Albert
          s'adresse à Gabriel avec un petit sourire en coin.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et bien, vous voyez, elle, ça la conduit à La Bourboule !
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Tenez, on est entre nous... Voulez-vous que je vous
           dise ?...
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mais enfin, Suzanne, notre voyage de noces n'intéresse pas
           monsieur Fouquet.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Vous n'aimez pas les voyages ? Albert est imbattable là-
           dessus. Si je vous disais qu'il connait les horaires de
           tous les trains d'Europe, même les horaires de
           correspondance.
                         
          Albert pose sa serviette et se lève.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh, ben écoute, arrête... Oh, arrête !
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Oh, Albert, sois gentil, montre tes horaires à monsieur
           Fouquet.
          Marie-Jo vient déposer une corbeille de fruits sur la table.
          Albert ouvre un tiroir du buffet situé à côté de la table.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mais ça ne l'intéresse pas.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Mais si, voyons, au contraire.
                         
          Albert sort une boite de cigare du tiroir.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Ah, tu vois ! Même pour les petits déplacements, c'est
           pareil.
                         
          Elle se lève et se dirige vers un buffet situé de l'autre côté de
          la table. Albert tend la boite de cigares à Gabriel, qui en prend
          un. Gabriel écoute le babillage de Suzanne tout en regardant
          Albert avec une lueur amusée dans les yeux.
                         
           SUZANNE QUENTIN (voix off)
           Tenez, il doit partir demain soir pour Blangy. Et ben, il a
           déjà en poche son aller et retour...
                         
          Elle fouille dans le tiroir du buffet.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           ... sa correspondance, sa chambre d'hôtel retenue, tout.
           C'est pas quelque chose, ça ?
                         
          Elle sort du tiroir un gros classeur, referme le tiroir et revient
          vers la table sur laquelle elle pose le classeur, puis elle
          s'assoit. Gabriel, le visage soudain un peu grave, tripote son
          cigare sans l'allumer.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je ne savais pas que vous partiez.
          Albert s'assoit et prend un cigare dans la boite.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh, pour deux jours. Tous les ans, à la Toussaint, je vais
           sur la tombe de mon père en Picardie. Mais vous serez
           surement encore là à mon retour ?
                         
          Il regarde Gabriel qui ne lui répond pas, puis qui se lève.
          Suzanne, elle, est en train de sortir les livres d'horaires de
          train du classeur.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Bon, ben, je vous souhaite un bon voyage, monsieur Quentin.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Vous nous quittez déjà ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Oui, je vais me dégourdir un peu les jambes avant de
           monter.
          Il met le cigare dans la poche de sa veste sur le porte-manteau,
          puis décroche la veste.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et bien, vous ne savez pas ce que vous perdez, parce que je
           vous avais mis de côté un vieux calva de trente ans.
                         
          Gabriel enfile sa veste et noue son cache-nez.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je veux pas vous retarder. Demain, c'est dimanche, vous
           partez le soir, vous aurez une journée chargée. Merci pour
           cette excellente soirée.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Oh, c'était tout simple.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Mais familial.
                         
          Il s'éloigne dans le vestibule vers la porte de l'hôtel
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Tu lui offres du calva, c'est malin ! Heureusement qu'il
           est raisonnable.
                         
          On entend la porte d'entrée qui se ferme. Albert se lève, le
          cigare au bec, et se dirige vers la baie vitrée qui donne sur la
          rue.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - RUE HÔTEL STELLA - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Plan rapprochée sur les vitres de l'hôtel. On voit Albert, le
          cigare au bec, qui regarde la rue par-dessus les rideaux.
                         
          Contrechamp sur Gabriel qui se dirige vers le Café Normand, mais
          qui passe devant sans s'arrêter.
          HOTEL STELLA - CHAMBRE ALBERT - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Albert allume la lumière et entre dans la chambre. Suzanne le suit
          et referme la porte. Albert sort un bonbon de sa poche, le sort de
          son emballage et s'approche de la fenêtre entr'ouverte.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - RUE HÔTEL STELLA - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Plan rapproché sur la fenêtre d'Albert qui met le bonbon dans sa
          bouche et s'appuie sur la rambarde pour regarder dans la rue d'un
          air pensif. Derrière lui, Suzanne prépare le lit.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Tout de même, quand je pense, du calva... Avoue que c'est
           une trouvaille ! C'est simple, t'aurais voulu le faire
           boire, tu t'y serais pas pris autrement.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Si. J'aurais bu avec lui.
                         
          Suzanne se retourne vers son mari.
          Contrechamp de la rue vue de la fenêtre d'Albert. Gabriel revient
          de sa « promenade » et pose la main sur la poignée de la porte du
          Café Normand. Il s'arrête et regarde vers la fenêtre d'Albert. Il
          fait quelques pas dans la rue, et fait un grand salut à Albert.
          Puis il retourne vers l'entrée du café, ouvre la porte et entre
          dans l'établissement.
                         
          Retour sur Albert, qui regarde toujours dans la rue, accoudé à la
          rambarde de la fenêtre.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Albert, tu parlais pas sérieusement ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Tu crois pas que tu ferais mieux de te coucher.
                         
          Il crache son bonbon dans la rue.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Réponds-moi d'abord.
                         
          Il ferme la fenêtre.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - CHAMBRE ALBERT - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Albert finit de fermer la fenêtre, et se tourne vers sa femme.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Écoute, ma bonne Suzanne, t'es une épouse modèle.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Oh !...
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mais si, t'as que des qualités, et physiquement, t'es
           restée comme je pouvais l'espérer. C'est le bonheur rangé
           dans une armoire. Et tu vois, même si c'était à refaire, et
           bien je crois que je t'épouserais de nouveau. Mais tu
           m'emmerdes.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Albert !
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Tu m'emmerdes gentiment, affectueusement, avec amour, mais
           tu m'emmerdes !
                         
          Il s'éloigne un peu d'elle, dont on voit le visage contrarié dans
          le miroir.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           J'ai pas encore les pieds dans le trou, mais ça vient, Bon
           Dieu, tu te rends pas compte que ça vient. Et plus ça
           vient, plus je m'aperçois que j'ai pas eu ma ration
           d'imprévu, et j'en redemande ! T'entends, j'en redemande.
                         
          Il s'est un peu énervé au fur et à mesure qu'il parlait.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           L'imprévu ? Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
          Albert lui répond d'une voix plus calme.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh ! Rien, c'est des idées d'un autre monde. Et puis, ne
           parlons plus de ça, va.
                         
          Il se rapproche d'elle.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Parce que, tu sais, si ça te manquait vraiment, si t'y
           pensais trop, tu pourrais... je sais pas, moi... reprendre
           un peu de vin au repas... un demi-verre.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Un demi-verre ? Dis-toi bien que si quelque chose devait me
           manquer, ce serait plus le vin, ce serait l'ivresse !
                         
          Il s'éloigne de Suzanne, qui ne bouge pas et reste très pensive.
                         
          Fondu au noir.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - RUE HÔTEL STELLA - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Deux touristes allemands sortent des bagages du coffre avant de
          leur voiture : une Coccinelle Volkswagen, dont le moteur, lui, est
          situé à l'arrière. L'homme parle en allemand à sa femme. Il
          referme le coffre, prend les valises et se dirige vers l'entrée de
          l'hôtel. Derrière eux, est garée une grosse voiture américaine
          noire.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - SALLE À MANGER - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Par la porte ouverte entre la salle à manger et le vestibule, on
          voit Marie-Jo, qui se dirige vers le couple de touristes
          allemands, qui vient d'entrer. Elle prend les valises des mains de
          l'homme. Le couple entre dans la salle à manger, dont presque
          toutes les tables sont occupées. Albert, portant un tablier blanc,
          est occupé à servir des clients. Il se redresse vers les nouveaux
          arrivants.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Messieurs-dames. Germaine !
                         
          Il vient de se tourner vers une serveuse habillée de noir et
          portant un tablier blanc. Il s'agit d'une serveuse qui ne vient
          travailler à l'hôtel que lorsque l'affluence le nécessite.
          Germaine entraîne le couple allemand vers une table libre. Albert
          se tourne vers Suzanne, qui vient d'entrer, un calepin à la main,
          et désigne une table libre, sur laquelle est installée un service
          de petit-déjeuner, qui n'a pas été touché.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Tiens, Suzanne, débarrasse-moi ça.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Mais c'est le petit-déjeuner de monsieur Fouquet.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oui, et ben, à cette heure-là, une aspirine lui suffira.
          TIGREVILLE - RUE HÔTEL STELLA - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          L'homme au béret, l'habitué de chez Esnault, qui travaille au
          Cours Dillon, court dans la rue et entre précipitamment dans
          l'hôtel.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - SALLE À MANGER - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          L'homme au béret entre dans la salle, et regarde autour de lui. Il
          avise Suzanne et se tourne vers elle.
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Albert est là ?
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Il est à la cuisine.
                         
          L'homme se précipite vers la cuisine.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - CUISINE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Albert a ouvert le four et est en train de surveiller un plat qui
          cuit à l'intérieur. L'homme au béret entre précipitamment.
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Quentin ! Y a ton Espagnol qu'est au carrefour.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mais alors ? C'est pas son droit d'être au carrefour ?
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Mais pas de faire ce qu'il fait ! Ah, tu peux pas savoir.
           C'est une catastrophe !
                         
          TIGREVILLE - CARREFOUR - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Un carrefour avec une rue qui monte vers une propriété privée,
          dont le portail est ouvert. Une foule est massée derrière la
          barrière de la propriété, et d'autres personnes sont groupées, en-
          dessous d'eux, au bord de la route. Mais on ne voit pas encore ce
          qu'ils regardent. Par contre, on entend leurs éclats de voix.
                         
          Une DS Citroën zigzague sur la route et s'arrête devant le
          portail. Le conducteur descend précipitamment de son véhicule, et
          se dirige vers le centre du carrefour. Gabriel est debout au
          milieu de la route, la veste à la main.
                         
                          LE CONDUCTEUR
           Vous êtes complètement cinglé, non ?
                         
          Gabriel salue le conducteur. Une autre voiture arrive à vive
          allure d'une route qui descend vers le carrefour.
                         
          A son passage, Gabriel fait une « passe » avec sa veste, à la
          manière d'un matador.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Olé !
          Le conducteur, certainement affolé, perd un peu le contrôle de son
          véhicule, et se précipite vers un groupe de personnes, massés
          devant une boutique d'antiquités. Les gens s'éparpillent en
          courant. Heureusement, la voiture réussit à s'arrêter, sans
          toucher personne. Une autre voiture, une grosse américaine,
          arrivant en sens inverse du centre ville, klaxonne, car son
          conducteur ne comprend pas la manoeuvre étrange du premier
          véhicule.
                         
          VOITURE AMÉRICAINE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Gabriel, vu à travers le pare-brise de la voiture, agite sa veste
          devant la voiture, qui s'arrête juste devant lui. Il pointe une
          épée imaginaire et la plante dans le pare-brise, comme s'il
          donnait l'estocade finale au taureau qu'il venait de combattre.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - CARREFOUR - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          L'intérieur du véhicule, vu de la rue. Un homme est au volant,
          deux femmes sont assises à l'arrière. Il semble tous un peu
          affolés par ce qu'il vient de leur arriver.
                         
                          LE CONDUCTEUR
           I say, you're crazy !
           (traduction : Dis donc, vous êtes fou !)
                         
          Gabriel se tourne vers la foule massée derrière la barrière de la
          propriété, et qui l'acclame. On lui lance même un chapeau, qu'il
          attrape au vol. Gabriel marche le long de la route, saluant la
          foule en brandissant le chapeau.
                         
          Il revient vers le centre du carrefour, et lance le chapeau, prêt
          à affronter un autre « taureau » automobile ! Une 404 blanche,
          venant de la route qui descend vers la ville, le frôle à vive
          allure.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Olé !
                          LA FOULE
           Olé ! Olé ! Olé !...
                         
          Une autre voiture, venant du centre ville, évite Gabriel de
          justesse. Elle s'arrête au milieu du carrefour, et le conducteur
          en sort précipitamment. Il fonce vers Gabriel.
                         
          Gabriel fait une passe sur une autre voiture en provenance de la
          ville.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Olé !
                         
          Une voiture noire arrive de la route, et zigzague pour essayer
          d'éviter Gabriel.
                         
          Contrchamp sur Gabriel, au milieu du carrefour, qui bouge de
          droite à gauche, pour essayer de rester dans l'axe de la voiture.
          On a l'impression que la caméra est placée sur la voiture. Zoom
          avant sur Gabriel qui se rapproche. Sa veste passe sur l'objectif
          de la caméra, comme si elle passait sur le pare-brise de la
          voiture. Puis on voit la foule qui s'écarte pour éviter la
          voiture.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Olé !...
                         
          La foule entoure Gabriel toujours debout au milieu du carrefour,
          et l'acclame.
                         
          Vue aérienne de la route qui revient vers le centre ville.
          Gabriel, entouré de ses admirateurs, marche vers la ville. On
          entend des klaxons.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - UNE RUE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Albert et l'homme au béret marchent d'un pas rapide, allant au-
          devant du cortège qui entoure Gabriel. Tous, d'ailleurs, dans ceux
          qui le suivent, ne semblent pas enthousiastes à son sujet. On
          entend, en effet, un conducteur mécontent.
                         
           UN CONDUCTEUR MÉCONTENT (voix off)
           Espèce de salaud ! Je vais t'arranger le portrait, moi.
                         
          Albert rejoint Gabriel et la foule qui l'entoure.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Alors quoi ? Qu'est-ce qu'y a ? Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
                         
           UNE FEMME SUR LE TROTTOIR
           Si c'est pas une honte ! Faire ça le jour des morts !
                         
          Un homme, d'aspect cossu et bourgeois, marche à côté de son
          chauffeur en uniforme.
                         
                          L'HOMME COSSU
           Si mon chauffeur n'avait pas freiné, on l'écrasait !
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Il a freiné ? Et ben alors, c'est fini, n'en parlons plus.
                         
                          L'HOMME COSSU
           Ce serait trop commode ! On est venu en pèlerinage, nous,
           monsieur, on n'est pas venu au cirque !
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et bien, allez-y à votre pèlerinage, la route est libre.
                         
           UNE FEMME SUR LE TROTTOIR
           Y a pas longtemps !
                         
          Il prend le bras de Gabriel et l'entraîne avec lui.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Allez, viens, toi.
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Ben, dis donc, Albert, tu vas quand même pas prendre sa
           défense !
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mais je prends la défense de personne. Vous voyez pas qu'il
           est pas dans son état normal ?
                         
          Un peu plus loin. Albert tient toujours le bras de Gabriel, suivi
          par la foule. Gabriel dit trois mots en espagnol, puis :
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           J'attends la présidence pour m'offrir les oreilles ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Vous pourriez pas faire un entracte, non ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Yo soy unico !
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Fermez-la, mon vieux, oh, fermez-la.
                         
          Le cortège arrive devant la gendarmerie. A côté de la porte, une
          affiche sur laquelle est inscrit : « Jeunes gens - Effectuez votre
          service légal outre-mer - En devançant l'appel de votre classe. »
          Deux gendarmes sortent de la gendarmerie.
                         
          Gabriel leur fait un grand salut de la main.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Olé, carabineros ! Como va ustedes ?
                         
          Maurice, le brigadier, qui a un fort accent du Sud-Ouest, se
          tourne vers Albert.
                         
                          MAURICE
           Alors, vous trouvez qu'on n'a pas assez de travail
           aujourd'hui. Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
                         
          Une voix sort de la foule, celle du monsieur avec chauffeur.
                         
                          L'HOMME COSSU
           Y a que ce petit crétin a failli faire au moins dix
           accidents !
                         
          Albert se tourne vers lui.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Y en a pas eu, d'accident.
                         
           Il se tourne vers Maurice.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Il a bu un coup, c'est pas une affaire, quoi.
                         
           MAURICE (voix off)
           Et d'où qui sort ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           C'est un client à moi.
                         
          Retour sur Maurice, qui écarte les bras.
                         
                          MAURICE
           Client ! C'est pas un état-civil, ça, client ! Vous n'êtes
           pas d'ici, hein ?
                         
          Contrechamp sur la foule massée au pied de la gendarmerie, dont
          l'entrée est légèrement surélevée par rapport au niveau de la rue.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Et vous, vous êtes d'ici, avec votre accent du Cantal ?
                         
                          MAURICE
           Rodez ! Dans le Cantal ? Il est saoul comme une bourrique !
                         
          Il se tourne vers son collègue.
                         
                          MAURICE
           Alexandre, embarquez-moi monsieur, qu'on regarde ses
           papiers.
                         
          Le gendarme Alexandre descend les quelques marches qui mènent à la
          rue et prend Gabriel par le bras. Il le pousse vers le haut des
          marches et l'entrée de la gendarmerie. Albert les suit.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           La sortie en triomphe ! Enfin ! Regarde, public ingrat !
           Arrache-toi les yeux !
                         
          Pour ponctuer encore la sortie théâtrale de Gabriel, les cloches
          de l'église se mettent à sonner.
                         
          Après que Gabriel soit entré dans la gendarmerie, la foule
          commence à se disperser.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - PLACE DE L'ÉGLISE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Plan d'ensemble de la place devant l'église. C'est la sortie de la
          messe. Les petites pensionnaires, dans leur uniforme sombre, mais
          avec la capuche relevée, sortent de l'église en rang deux par
          deux, précédées par la directrice dans son fauteuil roulant,
          poussé par une maîtresse en manteau gris. A la fin du cortège,
          Marie Fouquet marche toute seule derrière les autres.
                         
          Le cortège contourne l'église. Derrière l'église, on aperçoit la
          gendarmerie avec les mots « Gendarmerie Nationale » inscrits sur
          le haut du bâtiment.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - GENDARMERIE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Plan moyen sur Gabriel assis sur une chaise, le menton dans les
          mains. Il écoute distraitement Maurice le brigadier, que l'on ne
          voit pas.
                         
           MAURICE (voix off)
           Fouquet Gabriel, né à Paris le 18 mai 1930. Domicile : 14,
           rue Lincoln, Paris huitième. Profession...
                         
          Maurice, qui est en train de lire la carte d'identité de Gabriel,
          prononce Lincoln à la française. Panoramique découvrant Maurice
          assis derrière son bureau, et Albert devant. L'autre gendarme est
          assis sur un fauteuil derrière Albert.
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mais enfin, Maurice, puisque je te dis que je me porte
           garant pour lui, alors laisse tomber, quoi. Tu peux bien
           faire ça pour moi.
                         
          Gabriel se lève péniblement.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Muchas gracias, señor, seulement, je suis adulte...
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Monsieur Fouquet, vous commencez à nous cassez les noix, on
           ne veut plus vous entendre, on en a marre.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Parfait... puisqu'on peut plus rien dire, je vous attends
           dehors.
                         
          Gabriel ramasse sa veste sur une petite table et se dirige vers la
          porte.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ça va, c'est ça, allez prendre l'air, ça vous fera du bien.
                         
          Gabriel sort de la gendarmerie. Albert se tourne vers Maurice.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Tu vois bien que c'est de l'enfantillage. Demain, il sera
           parti, et personne n'y pensera plus.
                         
                          MAURICE
           Bon, mais tu le ramènes chez toi, hein ? Que je le voie
           plus en train de trainer en ville. Et que ça lui serve de
           leçon.
                         
          Maurice se lève et tend la carte d'identité de Gabriel à Albert.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ben, j'espère, ou alors il est incorrigible.
                         
          Alors qu'Albert se dirige vers la sortie, le téléphone sonne.
          Maurice se dirige vers l'imposant poste téléphonique fixé au mur,
          et décroche.
                         
                          MAURICE
           Allo, ici la gendarmerie de Tigreville. Comment ? Qu'est-ce
           que vous dites ?
                         
          On entend la porte qui se ferme. Le gendarme Alexandre se lève et
          soulève légèrement le rideau pour voir ce qu'il se passe dehors.
                         
                          MAURICE
           Y a un bouchon terrible à Hennequeville ?
                         
          TIGREVILLE - PLACE DE L'ÉGLISE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Albert sort de la gendarmerie et commence à contourner l'église.
          Il retrouve Gabriel assis sur les marches devant le monument aux
          morts, la tête dans les mains. Albert s'approche de lui.
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et ben, qu'est-ce qui vous prend ?
                         
          Gabriel relève la tête.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je crois que j'ai honte.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Allons, mon gars, on n'a pas le droit d'avoir honte, quand
           on a réussi une corrida comme la votre. Hein ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           La deuxième voiture était difficile, elle chargeait
           toujours à gauche, vous avez vu ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Les voitures anglaises, c'est toujours comme ça. C'est la
           déformation. Allez, venez.
                         
          Il lui rend sa carte d'identité et l'aide à se relever. Gabriel
          récupère son document et descend les marches.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Où on va ? J'irai bien prendre un verre. Pas pour boire,
           pour me remonter.
                         
          Albert le regarde un instant, puis dit :
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           D'accord, mais pas chez Esnault.
                         
          Il lui prend le coude et l'entraîne avec lui.
                         
          BAR « CHINOIS » - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          En quinze ans, les marches qui permettent d'accéder au bar
          « chinois » en haut de sa colline, n'ont pas changé : elles sont
          toujours aussi « rustiques ». Albert et Gabriel les montent
          lentement. Gabriel regarde la bâtisse au sommet de la colline et
          s'arrête sur une marche. La bâtisse, non plus, n'a pas changé.
          Seule la tour métallique surmontée par les sirènes a disparu.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Dites donc...
                         
          Albert s'arrête et se tourne vers Gabriel.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Quoi ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Qu'est-ce que c'est que votre endroit ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et bien, les gourmands, ils disent que c'est une maison de
           passe et les vicelards un restaurant chinois.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Vous y allez souvent ?
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           J'y allais.
                         
          Il reprend son escalade, suivi par Gabriel.
                         
          Ils sont presque arrivés au sommet. Gabriel regarde la bâtisse et
          s'arrête de nouveau.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           A votre avis, pour ce qu'on veut en faire, vaudrait mieux
           que ce soit canaille ou chinois ?
                         
          Albert s'est arrêté pour l'écouter.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Que ce soit fermé.
                         
          Il reprend sa marche.
                         
          BAR « CHINOIS » - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          L'intérieur du bar « chinois » n'a pas changé non plus.
                         
          Albert ouvre la porte, et entre suivi par Gabriel, qui referme la
          porte derrière eux. Ils se dirigent vers le bar, lorsqu'ils sont
          arrêtés par une voix venant du haut de l'escalier.
                         
           GEORGINA (voix off)
           Albert !
                         
          Les deux hommes tournent la tête vers l'escalier.
                         
          Georgina descend l'escalier. Elle n'a, pour ainsi dire, pas changé
          en quinze ans.
                         
                          GEORGINA
           C'est pas possible ! C'est un revenant !
          Elle regarde Albert avec un grand sourire.
                         
                          GEORGINA
           Tiens, je suis trop contente. Tu permets que je
           t'embrasse ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Je te permets.
                         
          Elle lui fait une bise sur chaque joue. Albert se tourne vers
          Gabriel.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Je te présente un matador.
                         
          Georgina s'incline légèrement en souriant.
                         
                          GEORGINA
           Enchantée, monsieur.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mais je te promets pas qu'il soit tout à fait authentique.
                         
          Georgina se dirige vers le bar, suivie par ses deux clients.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ici non plus, c'est pas très authentique, mais avec le vent
           du Tibet, ça peut faire illusion. Tenez, mon vieux, si je
           vous disais que, certains soirs, hein, derrière ce mur, là,
           et bien j'ai vu... Pas cru voir, hein !... J'ai vu !... Une
           ville, des tramways, la foule, des drames...
                         
          Un plan rapide sur le mur dont parle Albert, et sur lequel il y a
          seulement la grande affiche légale contre la répression de
          l'ivresse sur la voie publique, entourée d'aquarelles
          « chinoisantes » et d'une réclame pour l'apéritif « Saint
          Raphaël ».
                         
          Retour vers le bar, derrière lequel trône Georgina.
                         
                          GEORGINA
           Qu'est-ce que je vous sers ?
                         
          Albert se tourne vers Gabriel.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Qu'est-ce que vous voulez comme remontant ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je vous fais confiance.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Bon. Est-ce que tu confectionnes toujours ton espèce de
           saké, là ?
                         
                          GEORGINA
           Bien sûr.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Alors, ça sera deux.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - RUE HÔTEL STELLA - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Plan rapproché en contre-plongée de l'enseigne éclairée de l'hôtel
          Stella.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - SALLE À MANGER - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Suzanne est assise seule à une petite table près des chambres
          froides, et sur laquelle est dressé un couvert pour deux
          personnes. Mais les assiettes sont vides et la carafe de vin n'a
          pas été entamée. La tête appuyée sur la main, Suzanne semble
          rêveuse. Derrière elle, on entend le brouhaha de la salle à
          manger. D'un seul coup, Suzanne se lève d'un bond.
                         
          Panoramique rapide vers l'entrée de la salle. Marie-Jo entre et
          pose son manteau sur le porte-manteau.
                         
                          MARIE-JO
           Y a surement aucune raison de s'inquiéter.
          Elle s'approche de Suzanne. Derrière les deux femmes, on
          s'aperçoit que la moitié environ des tables sont occupées.
          Germaine fait le service.
                         
                          MARIE-JO
           Depuis ce matin au carrefour, personne n'a revu monsieur.
           Je suis allé chez Landru, chez le pâtissier, j'ai même été
           chez Esnault, ben... y a pas plus de monsieur que de beurre
           au...
                         
          Elle fait un geste vague pour éviter de dire une bêtise. Elle
          sourit.
                         
                          MARIE-JO
           Si y avait eu un accident, ça se saurait.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Bien sûr, ça se saurait.
                         
          Suzanne se dirige vers la sortie de la salle. Marie-Jo la suit.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - VESTIBULE DE RÉCEPTION - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Suzanne commence à monter l'escalier. Marie-Jo, en sortant,
          s'aperçoit de la présence d'une valise dans le vestibule.
                         
                          MARIE-JO
           Tiens, la valise de monsieur. Qu'est-ce que j'en fais ?
                         
          Suzanne s'arrête un instant, puis reprend sa marche.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Vous pouvez la remonter. Maintenant, son train de huit
           heures...
                         
                          MARIE-JO
           Monsieur Fouquet n'a pas dîné ?
          Suzanne, qui est presque arrivée à l'étage, se retourne.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Non.
                         
                          MARIE-JO
           Si ça se trouve, ils sont ensemble.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Si ça se trouve, oui.
                         
          Elle reprend sa marche. Marie-Jo se penche pour ramasser la
          valise.
                         
          BAR « CHINOIS » - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Plan rapproché sur le comptoir du bar, sur lequel plusieurs verres
          de vin sont alignés. Gabriel remplit les verres. Zoom arrière
          découvrant Albert et Gabriel, debout devant le bar et en train de
          chanter.
                         
           ALBERT QUENTIN & GABRIEL FOUQUET (ensemble)
           Tata-talalala ! Tata-lalatin ! Tata-talalala ! Tata-
           lalatin !
                         
          Albert prend un verre.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           A l'Amiral Guépratte !
                         
          Il boit. Gabriel prend un verre.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           A el Gallo, le Divin Chauve !
                         
          Il boit. Ils reposent tous deux leurs verres vides. Albert prend
          un autre verre.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           A la gloire des fusiliers marins d'Extrême-Orient !
                         
          Il boit. Gabriel prend un autre verre.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           A Manolete ! Tué à Linarès par le taureau Isleiro !
                         
          Il boit. Albert repose son verre et en prend un autre.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et celui-là, je le bois à mon pote Gédéon, tombé dans le
           traquenard de Long Son !
                         
          Gabriel prend un autre verre.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           A Roselito, le plus grand de tous !
                         
          Il boit.
                         
          Appuyée contre la fresque derrière le bar (la même que quinze ans
          auparavant), Georgina les regarde d'un oeil critique.
                         
                          GEORGINA
           On a le temps, messieurs ! Si ça continue, vous allez vous
           saouler...
                         
          Tous les verres sur le comptoir sont maintenant vides.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Quand on est en perm', c'est pour ça !
                         
          Gabriel s'éloigne du bar, et s'approche de la porte vitrée qui
          sépare le bar de la pièce voisine.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mais qu'est-ce que tu cherches ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Claire, elle devait me prendre à la sortie des arènes...
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mais c'est de ta faute ! Si tu buvais plus vite, elle
           serait déjà là ! Les choses entraînent les choses... Le
           bidule crée le bidule... Y a pas de hasard ! Allez ! On
           rentre à la caserne.
                         
          Il fouille dans sa poche et sort une poignée de billets froissés
          qu'il pose sur le comptoir. Gabriel revient vers lui.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Ben, permets-moi au moins de t'inviter...
                         
          Il sort de l'argent de sa poche. D'un geste, Albert l'arrête.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           T'occupe, la Bleusaille ! J'ai touché mon arriéré de
           solde... Alors, hein !
                         
          Gros plan sur le comptoir. Parmi les billets de banque, qu'Albert
          y a déposés, se trouve un billet de train.
                         
          Gabriel le prend et le regarde de plus près.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Y t'ont payé avec un billet de train...
                         
          Albert le lui prend des mains.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Tiens !...
                         
          Il le déchire en deux, et en donne la moitié à Gabriel
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Je te donne l'aller et je garde le retour... Allez, fais-en
           autant !
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           J'peux pas...
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           T'as pas confiance ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           J'ai pas de billet...
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ah ! ben alors là, t'as tort ! Faut toujours avoir un
           billet... Au cas... Tu comprends ? Au cas...
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Qu'est-ce que tu crois m'apprendre... J'ai passé ma vie à
           faire des allers et retours. Instable, on appelle ça.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Bon, ben allez, on cause de trop, on se déshydrate, hein.
           Allez, viens.
                         
          Ils se retournent et se dirigent vers la sortie. Georgina se
          penche par-dessus le bar.
                         
                          GEORGINA
           Bonsoir, et bonne rentrée.
                         
          Albert est déjà sorti, mais Gabriel se retourne vers elle.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Madame, j'ai été charmé, positivement charmé.
                         
          Il sort à son tour, d'un pas un peu hésitant.
                         
          Georgina sourit et commence à défroisser les billets laissés par
          Albert sur le comptoir.
                         
          BAR « CHINOIS » - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Albert descend lentement les marches du bar. Il fredonne « Nuits
          de Chine ».
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           La-la-la la-la nuits de Chine, nuits d'amour ! La-la-la...
                         
          Gabriel sort à son tour du bar en nouant son écharpe. Puis il
          regarde autour de lui.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Merde !
                         
          Contrechamp et plan général sur la colline et la plage en
          contrebas, plongées dans le noir.
                         
           GABRIEL FOUQUET (voix off)
           Il fait nuit, dis donc.
                         
          Retour sur Gabriel et Albert, toujours debout en bas des marches
          du bar.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ben c'est normal, c'est le changement de latitude. Allez,
           en avant !
          Plan d'ensemble de la colline avec le bar au sommet et Gabriel et
          Albert qui descendent les marches de la colline, d'un pas un peu
          hésitant.
                         
           ALBERT QUENTIN & GABRIEL FOUQUET (ensemble)
           Nuits de Chine, nuits câlines, nuits d'amour !
                         
          Ils accompagnent leur chant de grands gestes.
                         
           ALBERT QUENTIN & GABRIEL FOUQUET (ensemble)
           Nuits d'ivresse, de tendresse...
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Merde !
                         
           ALBERT QUENTIN & GABRIEL FOUQUET (ensemble)
           La-la-la... Jusqu'au lever du jour. Nuits de Chine, nuits
           câlines...
                         
          Ils sont maintenant arrivés près de la caméra en plan moyen.
          Albert s'assoit sur un banc. Il dit la dernière strophe sans
          chanter.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Nuits d'amour.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           T'as le coup de pompe ?
                         
          Du pouce, Albert montre le bar derrière lui.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Non, mais c'est l'autre vache, là, l'indigène, qui a dû me
           filer du poison.
                         
          Gabriel s'assoit à côté de lui.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           T'as peut-être plus l'habitude. Si tu veux, on peut
           rentrer.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh, hé gamin, dis donc, hé, pas de faux-fuyant. C'est pas
           parce que t'as estoqué deux ou trois voitures, mais... Moi,
           j'ai pas eu mon compte. D'abord, on va leur montrer ce
           qu'un jeune et un vieux peuvent faire.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           A qui ça ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Aux affreux ! Allez viens.
                         
          Ils se lèvent tous les deux et reprennent leur marche.
                         
           ALBERT QUENTIN & GABRIEL FOUQUET (ensemble)
           Nuits de Chine...
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - CHAMBRE ALBERT - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
          La chambre est plongée dans le noir, mais les rideaux ne sont pas
          tirés sur les fenêtres. On entend, dans la rue, Albert et Gabriel
          chanter. Leur chant est dans la continuité de celui débuté dans la
                         SCÈNE PRÉCÉDENTE
                         
                         
           ALBERT QUENTIN & GABRIEL FOUQUET (ensemble et en voix off)
           ... nuits câlines, nuits d'amour !...
                         
          Lent panoramique vers le lit, dans lequel Suzanne est assise, les
          yeux grand ouverts.
                         
           ALBERT QUENTIN & GABRIEL FOUQUET (ensemble et en voix off)
           ... Nuits d'ivresse, de tendresse... Où l'on croit aimer
           jusqu'au lever du jour...
                         
          Suzanne s'allonge dans le lit, et rabat les couvertures sur elle.
                         
           ALBERT QUENTIN & GABRIEL FOUQUET (ensemble et en voix off)
           ... Nuits de Chine, Nuits câlines...
          CAFÉ NORMAND - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Plan moyen sur le billard, où un homme en cravate et casquette est
          en train de jouer. Derrière lui, la salle et le bar, devant lequel
          deux hommes sont accoudés. Un peu plus loin le long du comptoir,
          un autre homme, assis sur un tabouret, discute avec la patronne,
          debout derrière le bar. D'autres clients sont répartis autour des
          tables de la salle. Le joueur de billard s'éloigne de la table, et
          Lucien s'approche pour jouer à son tour. Il est en chemise,
          cravate et gilet. Dans un coin, derrière lui, on découvre
          Joséphine, en train de boire, seule à une table. La porte s'ouvre.
          Albert entre précipitamment, suivi de Gabriel, qui referme la
          porte. Ils s'accoudent tous les deux au comptoir.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Deux Calvas !
                         
          En entendant la voix d'Albert, Lucien s'arrête de jouer, et se
          tourne vers le bar. Il pose sa queue sur le billard.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Sois le bienvenu, Albert.
                         
          Il redescend lentement vers le comptoir.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Je me disais toujours : ça peut pas durer, on le reverra un
           jour. Et te revoilà... comme au bon vieux temps. Tiens ! Je
           me sens vingt ans de moins.
                         
          Il est maintenant arrivé près du comptoir. Albert boit son calva
          sans se retourner. Mais Gabriel se retourne vers Lucien.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           T'es qui ?
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Oh, toi, tu ferais mieux de t'en tenir là avant que tes
           espagnolades te reprennent !
                         
          Albert et Gabriel se retournent ensemble vers Lucien. Ils ont
          l'expression un peu vague des hommes qui ont trop bu. Gabriel
          s'incline légèrement vers Lucien, et lui dit, sur un ton très
                         POSÉ :
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Monsieur Esnault, si la connerie n'est pas remboursée par
           les assurances sociales, vous finirez sur la paille.
                         
          Gabriel se retourne vers le comptoir, mais Albert continue à fixer
          Lucien d'un air sévère.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Dis donc, petit malpoli, tu veux que je t'apprenne ?
                         
          Il fait un pas vers Gabriel, qui le regarde en souriant
          niaisement, mais Albert arrête Lucien.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Monsieur Esnault, je vous interdis de tutoyer mon homme de
           barre. Je vous ai déjà dit que vous n'étiez pas de la même
           famille.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Alors, toi, je te préviens, si t'es venu pour me donner des
           ordres, je vais vous virer tous les deux à coups de pompe
           dans le train !
                         
          Albert et Gabriel se regardent.
                         
           ALBERT QUENTIN & GABRIEL FOUQUET (ensemble)
           Ohh !...
                         
          Puis Gabriel fait signe à Albert que c'est à lui « de jouer » ! Et
          Albert balance à Lucien une baffe si violente qu'il titube sous le
          choc, et s'écroule sur l'escalier. Sa femme se précipite vers lui.
                         
                          MADAME ESNAULT
           Lucien !...
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et ce n'est qu'un coup de semonce.
                         
          Madame Esnault, et d'autres clients, qui sont accourus, aident
          Lucien à se relever. Lucien, fou de colère, cherche à se dégager
          de leurs mains.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Ah ! Ah ! Laisse-le moi, hein !
                         
                          MADAME ESNAULT
           Partez, ou j'appelle les gendarmes !
                         
                          JOSÉPHINE
           Ils ont déjà eu affaire à eux ce matin. Ils n'auraient pas
           dû les relâcher !
                         
                          UN CLIENT
           Mais laisse-les donc, ils sont ronds comme des boules.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oui, messieurs, pleins comme la mer. Ensuqué à rabord ! Y a
           longtemps que vous attendiez ça, hein ? Et ben, ça y est !
           Comme ça, vous pourrez causer et égayer vos soirées
           d'hiver ! Ah !
                         
          Il se retourne vers le comptoir. Derrière eux, on voit Madame
          Esnault et les clients qui entrainent Lucien vers le fond de la
          salle.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Albert...
                         
           Hmm ?...
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Ils me font mal aux yeux, tirons-nous.
                         
          Ils finissent leurs verres.
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           T'as raison, va, on a rien à foutre chez les Français
           moyens.
                         
          Ils se dirigent lentement vers la sortie.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           On n'appartient pas au même bataillon.
                         
          Lucien, debout au milieu de la salle, entouré de ses clients, les
          regarde partir.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Et les calvas, qui c'est qui va les payer ?
                         
          Albert et Gabriel se retournent vers lui.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Adressez-vous à l'intendance. Nous, on paye plus, on ne
           connait plus, on ne salue plus.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           On méprise.
                         
          Gabriel ponctue sa dernière phrase d'un grand geste. Albert salue
          l'assistance. Gabriel ouvre la porte, et ils sortent tous les
          deux. Albert claque violemment la porte derrière lui, faisant
          tomber un thermomètre publicitaire (Picon Pikina) accroché près de
          la porte. On l'entend se briser en heurtant le sol.
                         
           LUCIEN ESNAULT (voix off)
           Bon Dieu de Bon Dieu !
                         
          TIGREVILLE - RUE HÔTEL STELLA - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Albert et Gabriel sortent du café et marchent dans la rue longeant
          l'hôtel Stella. Gabriel s'arrête devant l'hôtel.
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Albert...
                         
          Albert se retourne.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Quoi ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           J'ai peur que ta femme soit pas contente.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Parle pas de femmes en patrouille.
                         
          Il reprend sa marche un peu titubante, suivi par Gabriel.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Juste... Le vent commence à fraîchir. T'as prévu un
           mouillage ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Blangy, dans la Somme. Faut que je te présente à mon père.
          Gabriel s'arrête de marcher.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Albert...
                         
          Albert se retourne.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Qu'est-ce qu'y a encore ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Blangy, c'est pas possible.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Alors, là, tu seras porté déserteur. En opérations, tu sais
           où ça mène ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je peux pas partir d'ici... pas tout seul, tu comprends ?
           J'ai une mission.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Une mission ?... Ah, ben là, tu tombes dans ma spécialité.
           Il s'agit de quoi ?
                         
          Gabriel met un doigt sur ses lèvres.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Chhhhut !...
                         
          Il se rapproche de lui et parle plus bas.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je t'ai parlé de ma fille ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           La petite Marie ?
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           C'est ça. Et ben, elle est pas heureuse, la petite Marie.
           Et ben, faut que j'aille la chercher et que je la ramène
           avec moi.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et ben, on y va.
                         
          Il se remet en marche. On entend le son d'un poste de radio
          provenant d'une maison indéterminée.
                         
           L'ANIMATEUR DE RADIO (voix off)
           Et voici maintenant, comme chaque soir, une émission de
           Jean-Michel Audiard : « Ici l'on danse ! »...
                         
          Gabriel s'arrête au milieu de la rue.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Albert !...
                         
          Albert se retourne.
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Je peux pas y aller comme ça.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Tu peux pas, tu peux pas. Mais t'es marrant, toi. Qu'est-ce
           que ça veut dire, tu peux pas ? Hein ?
                         
          On entend un son d'accordéon provenant d'une maison, certainement
          d'un poste de radio. Les deux hommes lèvent la tête. Gabriel
          esquisse quelques pas de danse. Albert se met à danser aussi en
          chantant.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ta-la-la la-laaa...
                         
          Ils sont maintenant tous les deux en train de danser au milieu de
          la rue.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ti-la-la la-laaa... Ta-la-la la-laaa... La-la la-laaa...
           Ta-la-lala-la...
                         
          Une fenêtre s'ouvre au premier étage de la maison devant laquelle
          ils dansent, et un homme en pyjama apparaît.
                         
           LE VOISIN RONCHON
           Hé, vous allez taire vos gueules, un peu, là, oui ?
                         
          Albert et Gabriel lui font, tous les deux ensemble, un bras
          d'honneur.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ti-la-la la-laaa...
                         
          Un autre homme, en pyjama, sort d'une maison voisine.
                         
           UN AUTRE VOISIN RONCHON
           C'est tout de même malheureux de se mettre dans un état
           pareil, croyez-moi !
                         
          Pour toute réponse, Albert hausse la voix.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ti-la-la la-laaa...
                         
          Il lui fait un bras d'honneur.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           La-la la-la...
                         
          Ils s'éloignent en dansant. L'homme rentre chez lui.
                         
          COURS DILLON - PARC - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          L'imposant portail du Cours Dillon, vu de la route. On entend
          Albert chanter.
                         
           ALBERT QUENTIN (voix off)
           La-la-la la-laaa... Ti-la-la la-laaa...
          Albert et Gabriel entre dans le champ en dansant, et s'approche du
          portail.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ti-la-la la-laaa... Ti-la-la la-laaa...
                         
          Contrechamp sur Albert et Gabriel, vus à travers les barreaux de
          la grille du portail, et qui regardent à l'intérieur du parc.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Bon, ben... A première vue, les défenses ont l'air assez
           faible.
                         
          Contrechamp et plan d'ensemble de l'imposant manoir du cours
          Dillon, vu à travers les arbres du parc.
                         
          Retour sur Gabriel et Albert, toujours les mains sur les barreaux
          de la grille et regardant à l'intérieur du parc.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Alors, inutile de contourner, on va prendre ça en force.
           Allez ! Je me mets en flèche, et puis tu me files le train.
                         
          Albert a déjà saisi les barreaux, prêt à escalader le portail.
          Gabriel lui prend le bras.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Hé !... Excuse-moi, Mais c'est pas à toi de prendre les
           commandes, il s'agit tout de même de ma fille.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           D'accord... D'accord !...
                         
          Gabriel commence à escalader le portail. Albert se retourne et se
          plaque le dos contre la grille. Gabriel lui met les deux pieds sur
          les épaules.
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ohh !... Oh, ben dis donc, ben t'es un faux maigre !
                         
          Contre-plongée sur le haut du portail et Gabriel, qui a maintenant
          la tête au niveau du sommet du portail, mais qui fait face à la
          route.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           C'est peut-être que j'ai la langue chargée.
                         
          Retour sur Albert.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh !... Ben qu'est-ce tu fous ? Tourne-toi de l'autre côté,
           voyons.
                         
          Albert se dégage, et fait deux pas vers la route. Gabriel cale ses
          pieds sur une barre horizontale de la grille.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Albert !
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Quoi ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Regarde !
                         
          Albert se retourne. Zoom arrière, découvrant Gabriel accroché, les
          bras en croix, au portail.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           C'est moi, le Christ !
                         
          Le portail s'ouvre lentement, et Gabriel se retrouve accroché à la
          porte de droite.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ah !.... Ah !... Ah !...
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Hé, Albert, hé, me laisse pas ! Albert !...
                         
          Albert se précipite et Gabriel lui tombe dans les bras.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh !... Oh !...
                         
          Gabriel se rétablit sur le sol.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Oh ben, ça roupille là-dedans, dis donc... Y a une
           sonnette...
                         
          Il se tourne vers Albert.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Y a une sonnette ?
                         
          Il met un doigt sur ses lèvres, s'approche de la cloche fixée au
          portail et tire vigoureusement sur le cordon, faisant tinter la
          cloche. Puis il se dirige vers le manoir, suivi par Albert.
                         
          Comme ils s'approchent de la bâtisse, on voit deux fenêtres
          d'angle s'éclairer au premier étage.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Oh, ben, les voilà qui se réveillent, tiens !
                         
          D'autres fenêtres s'éclairent, mais au rez-de chaussée.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ah ! Enfin ! Ah ben, dis donc !
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Ah, ben voilà !
                         
          Albert se met à crier :
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Hé, branle-bas de combat, là-dedans !... Branle-bas de
           combat, je te dis, là-dedans ! Hein !
          Plan rapproché sur la porte d'entrée du manoir.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Allez, comme en 14, investissons l'ouvrage.
                         
          Il appuie très longuement sur le bouton de la sonnette.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ben alors, on se fout de nous, oui ? Mais, ma parole, c'est
           le soufflet au Sultan ! Oh, Bon Dieu !
                         
          Il donne plusieurs coups de pied dans la porte.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Si j'avais un obusier de 37, je te ferais sauter ça, et
           puis vite fait !
                         
          Gabriel, qui regarde à travers les rideaux, l'arrête de la main.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Arrête !
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Quoi ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Ils envoient un plénipotentiaire.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ah ben, c'est pas trop tôt.
                         
          La porte s'entr'ouvre, et Georgette, l'infirmière de la
          directrice, apparaît.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           C'est vous, monsieur Quentin, qui faites tout ce raffut ?
          Albert la pousse et se faufile à l'intérieur du bâtiment, suivi
          par Gabriel.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mission exceptionnelle !
                         
          COURS DILLON - HALL D'ENTRÉE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Albert et Gabriel pénètrent dans le hall, pendant que Georgette
          referme la porte.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Monsieur Quentin, j'avais cru entendre dire que vous
           poursuiviez une convalescence souhaitable. Vous devriez
           avoir honte !
                         
          Gabriel grimpe sur l'un des fauteuils de cuir, et s'assoit sur le
          dossier. Il regarde Albert en riant.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Elle croit parler à ses niards ?
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mais il a raison ! Quartier-maître Quentin, du Corps
           Expéditionnaire d'Extrême-Orient !
                         
          Le hall d'entrée, vu en plongée depuis la galerie du premier
          étage. Attiré par la grosse voix d'Albert, un homme en robe de
          chambre vient s'accouder à la balustrade. Puis deux femmes, elles
          aussi en robe de chambre, apparaissent au bas de l'escalier.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           On vient reprendre livraison de la fillette de monsieur. Et
           si elle n'est pas livrée dans les trois minutes, je ne
           réponds pas de la réaction du papa !
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Le papa ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           C'est moi.
                         
          Une jeune fille, en nattes et chemise de nuit, vient s'accouder à
          la balustrade du premier étage.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           C'est nouveau, ça !
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Pas tellement, non.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Mais vous avez pourtant dit, l'autre jour que...
                         
          Venant de sa chambre à double porte battante, la directrice vient
          d'entrer dans la pièce sur sa chaise roulante.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Attention, les minutes tournent !
                          MADAME VICTORIA
           Who are they ? What's going on ? What does this people
           want ?
           (Traduction : Qui sont-ils ? Que se passe-t-il ? Que veut
           cet individu ?)
                         
          Retour au niveau du sol. Albert écarte les bras.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ahhh !... Ben si l'Anglais est déjà dans la place, alors je
           ne m'étonne plus de rien. !
                         
                          MADAME VICTORIA
           I... I don't understand. What do you mean ?
           (Traduction : Je... je ne comprends pas. Qu'est-ce que vous
           voulez dire ?)
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Tu vas voir comment je les traite, moi, les Anglais.
                         
          Gabriel saute de son fauteuil pour arrêter Albert qui s'avance,
          l'air menaçant, vers la directrice.
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Gaspille pas tes dons. Madame est française.
                         
          Il s'assoit - normalement ! - sur le fauteuil.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Tiens donc ! Comme le colonel Lawrence était arabe !
           Perfidie légendaire ! Mais pas avec moi. Je les connais,
           moi, tous vos trucs.
                         
                          MADAME VICTORIA
           I do not share this gentleman's opinion about England. But,
           most important, first we must ascertain whether this
           gentleman is really the father of our little Marie Fouquet.
           For the moment, gentlemen, it will be best for you to go.
           We can attend everything to-morrow morning.
           (Traduction : Je ne partage pas l'opinion de ce monsieur au
           sujet de l'Angleterre. Mais, plus important, nous devons,
           en premier lieu, nous assurer que ce monsieur est vraiment
           le père de notre petite Marie Fouquet. Pour le moment,
           messieurs, il serait préférable que vous partiez. On pourra
           s'occuper de tout cela demain matin.)
                         
          La voix de la directrice se durcit soudain
                         
                          MADAME VICTORIA
           And for the child's sake, I do hope that you will be more
           presentable. Georgette, will you see them to the door,
           please.
           (Traduction : Et pour le bien-être de l'enfant, j'espère
           fortement que vous serez plus présentables. Georgette,
           voulez-vous bien les raccompagner à la porte, s'il vous
           plait.)
                         
          La directrice tourne son fauteuil et se dirige vers la double
          porte battante.
          Gabriel se tourne vers Albert.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Elle a dit : à demain.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mais c'est Fachoda !
                         
          Gabriel se lève.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Dis donc, si on envisageait un repli ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mais pourquoi pas une retraite ?
                         
          Gabriel se dirige vers la porte. Albert reste sur place.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Moi, je trouve que c'est amener les couleurs un peu vite !
                         
          Il s'adresse à Georgette, tout en se dirigeant, lui aussi, vers la
          porte.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Estafette, faites savoir au chef de poste qu'on est
           d'accord pour remettre l'affaire à demain, mais demain
           matin, pas plus.
                         
          Il s'arrête alors qu'il est presque arrivé à la porte et se tourne
          vers Georgette.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et si, à dix heures, la fillette n'est pas à mon PC avec
           armes et bagages, et ben, vous entendrez parler des
           hussards de la mort ! Considérez ça comme un ultimatum.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Bien, monsieur Quentin, on transmettra.
                         
          Gabriel ouvre la porte et s'efface pour laisser passer Albert.
          Georgette les rejoint. Gabriel sort à son tour. Georgette ferme la
          porte derrière lui et donne deux tours de verrou.
                         
          COURS DILLON - PARC - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Albert et Gabriel viennent de sortir du bâtiment et se dirigent
          vers la sortie.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           T'as forcé un peu dans l'épouvante, mais t'as eu des
           moments romains.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Toujours. Quelle belle nuit, hein ?
                         
          Gabriel s'arrête.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           J'aimerais t'emmener en Andalousie, les nuits sont bleues.
          Albert se retourne.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ohh !... Mais en Chine aussi, monsieur, quand tu descends
           vers le Sud. Tu sais pas ce qu'il faudrait ?
                         
          Il tend les bras vers le ciel.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et ben, faudrait illuminer tout ça, peindre tout ça en
           rouge. Ben, on peut tout de même pas y foutre le feu...
           note bien qu'en y réfléchissant...
                         
          Gabriel se penche en avant, semblant en proie à une réflexion
          intense, un peu compliquée dans son état.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Tais-toi. Laisse-moi me rappeler... La féérie lumineuse...
           Le 14 juillet en boutique... Où est-ce que j'ai entendu ça,
           bon sang ? Parce que je l'ai entendu et vu... Si vous avez
           besoin de quoi que ce soit, je dis bien de quoi que ce
           soit... Un barbu... « Au Chic Parisien » !
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Landru !
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           C'est ça ! Il a une caisse, là, pleine de fusées, un stock
           à faire sauter Versailles.
                         
          Albert écarte les bras.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Embrasse-moi, mec !
                         
          Il le serre dans ses bras, et l'embrasse dans le cou.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Tiens, t'es mes vingt ans ! Nickelé, Champion du Monde ! On
           y va !
                         
          Ils se mettent à danser en se dirigeant vers la sortie du parc.
                         
           ALBERT QUENTIN & GABRIEL FOUQUET (ensemble)
           Ta-la-la la-la... Ta-la-la la-la...
                         
                         FONDU ENCHAINÉ
                         
          AU CHIC PARISIEN - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Les caisses de feu d'artifice sont ouvertes, et les fusées,
          qu'elles contiennent, ont certainement été répertoriées,
          puisqu'elles sont un peu en désordre. Sur un cageot, sont posées
          deux bouteilles de Beaujolais, une vide et une pleine. Les trois
          hommes sont en train de boire, Landru devant une caisse
          d'explosifs ouverte, Albert un peu en retrait derrière lui, et
          Gabriel assis sur une autre caisse. Ils reposent leurs verres.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Si vos pétards sont à la hauteur de votre Beaujolais, on va
           nous entendre du Havre !
                         
          Albert se ressert à partir de sa bouteille personnelle. Landru
          inspecte les mèches des fusées dans la caisse ouverte devant lui.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Oh-oh, pour péter, ça pètera, j'en réponds... comme de moi-
           même. Ça date pourtant de trente ans, mais inaltérable.
           Signé Ruggieri.
                         
          Il brandit deux fusées posées derrière lui. Gabriel saute de son
          perchoir.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Albert...
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Quoi ?
                         
          Gabriel soulève une caisse de fusées.
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           On pourra jamais porter ça à deux, il va falloir faire dix
           voyages, au moins.
                         
          Landru, les bras chargés de fusées, le regarde avec une certaine
          irritation.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Was ist das ? Il n'a jamais été question de jouer à ça sans
           moi, ne serait-ce que pour des raisons de survie. La
           pyrotechnie, messieurs, exige un savoir livresque et un
           tour de main absolument insoupçonnable.
                         
          Il empile son matériel dans une charrette à bras.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Bon, ben, allez, quoi, allons-y ! On n'oublie rien ?
                         
                          LANDRU
           Rien !
                         
          Il ouvre une caisse, dans laquelle il dépose les fusées qu'il
          avait en main.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Le programme est assuré. Vingt-trois marrons d'air, dix
           bombes étoilées multicolores, les éventails à surprise, dix
           phlox rotatifs, et un jardin suspendu.
                         
          Albert lève les bras vers le plafond.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Alors, là, messieurs, ça va être dantesque ! On va le
           repeindre, leur ciel !
                         
          Zoom avant sur la charrette remplie d'explosifs. On entend siffler
          une fusée.
          TIGREVILLE - RUE HÔTEL STELLA - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Contre-plongée sur le ciel au-dessus de Tigreville endormie. On
          entend siffler la fusée que l'on a déjà entendue sur l'image
          précédente, et des feux d'artifices éclatent dans le ciel.
                         
          Retour au niveau du sol. Devant l'hôtel, des touristes regardent
          le ciel, dont un officier anglais.
                         
                          L'OFFICIER ANGLAIS
           Splendid !
                         
          Nouvelle contre-plongée sur le ciel, montrant les feux d'artifices
          qui éclatent.
                         
          Autre contre-plongée au-dessus de l'hôtel Stella. Puis plusieurs
          contre-plongées en succession rapide, montrant divers angles du
          ciel entre les maison de Tigreville, tous illuminés par les feux
          d'artifice.
                         
          Plan moyen sur le Café Normand, d'où sort la patronne, enveloppée
          dans un châle blanc, suivie d'un client.
                          LE CLIENT
           Oh, merde, c'est tout de même pas le 14 juillet !
                         
          Il court vers la plage.
                         
                          MADAME ESNAULT
           Mai si, c'est bien un feu d'artifice, je le vois bien !
                         
          Tout le monde court vers la plage. Lucien sort, à son tour, du
          café et réajuste sa casquette. D'autres personnes courent dans la
          rue.
                         
          Nouvelle série de contre-plongées sur le ciel illuminé de
          Tigreville.
                         
          Retour vers Lucien, qui prend sa femme par le bras, et l'entraine
          vers la mer.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Ça vient de par là.
                         
          L'homme au béret, venant du bord de mer, rejoint Lucien et sa
          femme.
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Dis donc, y a Albert qui fait le con sur la plage avec un
           feu d'artifice. Faut voir ça.
                         
          Lucien part en courant dans le sens inverse de la mer.
                         
                          MADAME ESNAULT
           Lucien ! Fais attention ! Où vas-tu ?
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Là, regarde ça !
                         
          Plusieurs contre-plongées rapides sur le ciel illuminé.
          TIGREVILLE - LA GENDARMERIE - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Le brigadier Maurice et le gendarme Alexandre sortent de la
          gendarmerie et regardent vers le ciel. Tout le monde court dans la
          rue en direction de la plage.
                         
          Contre-plongée sur le ciel illuminé.
                         
          Retour au niveau du sol. Les deux gendarmes dévalent les marches
          du perron de la gendarmerie. Alexandre prend quand même le temps
          de fermer la porte.
                         
          Contre-plongée sur le ciel illuminé.

          Plan en contre plongée sur la façade de l'hôtel, montrant la
          fenêtre de la chambre d'Albert, à côté de l'enseigne. La fenêtre
          s'ouvre et Suzanne apparaît.
                         
          Contre-plongée sur le ciel illuminé.
          Plan en plongée vers la rue, comme vu de la fenêtre de la chambre
          d'Albert. Lucien arrive en courant, et lève la tête vers Suzanne.
                         
          Retour sur Suzanne, en chemise de nuit, qui regarde avec surprise
          toute l'agitation dans la rue.
                         
          Contrechamp et plan en plongée sur Lucien dans la rue.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Alors, madame Quentin, il paraît qu'Albert est sur la
           plage !
                         
          Il repart en courant vers la plage.
                         
          Autre plan de la rue avec les gens qui courent vers la plage.

          Les gens arrivent, en rangs serrés, et s'accoudent à la balustrade
          qui surplombe la plage. Sur la plage, en contrebas, on distingue
          les caisses de fusées, et des hommes debout à côté.
                         
           ALBERT QUENTIN (voix off provenant de la plage)
           Voilà les Balubas qui arrivent !
                         
           DES VOIX DANS LA FOULE
           Qu'est-ce qui font ? Il est cinglé !
                         
           ALBERT QUENTIN (voix off provenant de la plage)
           Et une verte !
                         
          Plan rapproché sur Gabriel allumant une fusée avec une mèche
          d'allumage. Il se rapproche d'Albert, qui regarde vers le ciel.
          Plan rapide sur le ciel illuminé.
                         
          Retour sur la plage.
                         
          Landru allume une fusée.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Une verte maintenant, Quentin !
                         
          La fusée part.
                         
          Plan rapide sur le ciel et la fusée qui éclate.
                         
          Retour sur la plage.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Et une rouge !
                         
          Il l'allume.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et maintenant, une tricolore ! On fait plus de détail.

          Retour vers la plage.
                         
          Albert et Gabriel s'approche de deux caisses de fusées reliées
          entre elle par un circuit de mèches.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           A vous de jouer, mon cher.
                         
          Gabriel écarte les bras.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Albert, j'en ferai rien. Quand il s'agit de faire sauter la
           ville, honneur à l'autochtone.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           L'autochtone n'en fera rien, tirez le premier !
                         
          Gabriel s'exécute et allume la caisse de fusées. Les deux hommes
          s'écartent. Les fusées commencent à partir en succession rapide.
                         
          Contre champ en plan d'ensemble de la foule massée derrière la
          balustrade. Les gens s'éloignent un peu devant la quantité de

          s'approchent de trois batteries de chandelles romaines.
                         
                          LANDRU
           A vos chandelles romaines !
                         
          Chaque homme est debout devant sa cible, mèche d'allumage à la
          main.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Présentez torches !
                         
          Les trois hommes lèvent les mèches au niveau de leur visage, comme
          s'ils saluaient avec un sabre de cavalerie.
                         
                          LANDRU
           A mon commandement, feu !
                         
          Chacun allume sa batterie, puis s'éloigne en courant. Les
          chandelles romaines partent en succession rapide.

          Sur la plage, plan d'ensemble des trois hommes qui s'approchent de
          trois mâts, supportant des sortes d'hélices, en fait des sortes de
          roues lumineuses, qu'en pyrotechnie, on appelle des « soleils ».
                         
                          LANDRU
           A nos morts !
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           A nos morts !
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           A nos morts !
                         
          Ils allument chacun la base d'un mât, puis ils s'éloignent, mèche
          levée, en chantant.
                         
           LANDRU, GABRIEL & ALBERT (ensemble)
           Ta-ta ta-la-la-la... Ta-ta ta-la-la-ta... Ta-ta ta-la-la-

          Plan d'ensemble de la foule, vue de dos sur la corniche au bord de
          la plage, avec les soleils qui tournent au-dessus de leurs têtes.
                         
          Plan rapproché sur les soleils qui tournent.
                         
          Retour sur la foule, avec les soleils au-dessus d'eux. Les deux
          gendarmes arrivent par derrière et écartent la foule.
                         
          Sur la plage, plan rapproché, en légère contre-plongée, des trois
          hommes qui regardent les soleils tourner.

           Hong-Kong, la Cucaracha, Singapour et la petite
           Tonkinoise !
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           La Puerta del Sol !
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et la fête continue !

          Contre-plongée sur la foule au bord de la balustrade, comme vue de
          la plage. Au premier rang, les deux gendarmes.
                         
                          MAURICE
           Arrêtez cette plaisanterie, je vais vous coffrer, moi !

                          LANDRU
           Ils ont amené les guignols !
                         
          Contre champ sur la foule et les gendarmes.
                         
                          MAURICE
           Je vous dis d'arrêter cette plaisanterie ! Oh mais...
                         
          Retour sur les trois hommes.
                         
                          LANDRU
           La délation, messieurs, réclame un châtiment. A nous les
           explosifs !
                         
          Ils partent en courant.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Joli temps pour les artilleurs !
                         
          Albert et Landru allument plusieurs fusées en même temps.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Aimable barbiflore, passez-moi les pétards !
                         
          Landru désigne une caisse.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Là, dans la caisse. C'est dans la boite.
                         
          Gabriel se penche sur la caisse.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Puisque vous n'avez rien de mieux.
                         
                          LANDRU
           La grenade offensive n'est pas courante en mercerie.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           On va tâcher de faire avec.
                         
          Il prend des fusées dans la caisse.
                         
          Rapide plan général sur le ciel illuminé, puis retour sur la
          plage.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Qu'est-ce qu'y a là-bas dedans ?
                         
          Il désigne quelque chose du doigt.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Attention ! Ça pète !
                         
          Il désigne la foule.
                         
          Plan d'ensemble de la foule, menée par les gendarmes, et qui
          descend le long de la rampe qui mène vers la plage.
                          MAURICE
           Pour la dernière fois, je vous somme de vous arrêter !
                         
          Retour sur la plage et les trois hommes.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Gendarme, faites évacuer les femmes et les enfants, je vais
           raser le littoral !
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Nous allons rayer la Normandie de la carte ! Feu !
                         
          Il lance sa fusée.
                         
          Plan moyen de la charrette de Landru, garée au pied de la rampe
          qui descend vers la plage. La fusée de Gabriel tombe dedans et
          allume les explosifs qu'elle contient. La foule, menée par les
          gendarmes, et qui était presque arrivée au bas de la rampe,
          s'arrête net, et revient en courant vers le haut de la rampe.
          Toutes les fusées, encore contenues dans la charrette, explosent
          les unes après les autres.
                         
          Plan d'ensemble de la foule qui remonte en désordre vers le haut
          de la rampe.
                         
          Retour sur la plage et les trois hommes. Albert pointe la foule du
                         DOIGT
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           L'ennemi est en fuite, mais maintenant une retraite
           s'impose, messieurs.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Chacun pour soi. Moi, je vais me baigner.
                         
          Il court vers la mer, une mèche d'allumage à la main.
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Qu'est-ce qu'on fait ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Descendons le Yang-Tsé-Kiang. C'est tout droit. Viens.
                         
          Ils s'éloignent en courant.

          Retour sur Albert et Gabriel qui marchent toujours sur la plage,
          s'éloignant des soleils, qui s'éteignent et s'arrêtent de tourner,
          l'un après l'autre.

          TIGREVILLE - BLOCKHAUS SUR LA PLAGE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Dans le blockhaus où Gabriel s'était réfugié pour ne pas être vu
          par Marie, Albert et Gabriel sont endormis, Albert, à moitié assis
          contre un mur, et Gabriel, allongé par terre en face de lui.
          Albert se réveille lentement.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh !... oh !...
                         
          Gabriel se relève lentement et se met en position assise.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Vous croyez pas qu'il serait temps de rentrer.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Rentrer où ? J'ai toujours entendu dire que, dans les cas
           de reniement, on entendait le coq chanter.
                         
          Albert se met debout.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oui, et ben, on parlera de ça plus tard, parce que j'ai un
           train à prendre.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Vous allez toujours à Blangy ?
                         
          Albert sort du blockhaus.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Hé oui, mon père a l'habitude que je sois là. Alors je
           serai là, pas brillant, mais là. Et vous, vous rentrez à
           Paris ?
                         
          Gabriel se met debout.
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           J'ai vu la mer, je ne peux pas aller plus loin.
                         
          Il sort, lui aussi, du blockhaus. Par l'ouverture, on les voit
          s'éloigner lentement tous les deux.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - PLAGE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Sur la promenade, au bord de la plage, se déroule une cérémonie
          officielle. Des soldats en uniforme français, anglais, américains,
          avec leurs drapeaux nationaux. Un officier anglais (ou
          américain ?) lit une déclaration, avec une très nette pointe
          d'accent anglais.
                         
                          OFFICIER ANGLAIS
           La France nous a toujours montré le chemin de la liberté.
                         
          Plusieurs soldats, au bord de la rambarde de pierre, se penchent
          pour regarder Albert et Gabriel, qui remontent l'escalier venant
          de la plage.
                         
                          OFFICIER ANGLAIS
           Liberté, liberté chérie, comme disait votre grand poète
           Victor Hugo. C'est au nom de cette liberté que sont tombés
           les victimes de la prodigieuse bataille dont cette petite
           plage française fut le théâtre tragique.
                         
          Albert et Gabriel sont maintenant arrivés en haut des marches, et
          s'éloignent tranquillement, sans un regard pour la cérémonie.
          L'assistance et les soldats, eux par contre, suivent les deux
          hommes du regard avec un certain intérêt. Un léger brouhaha, peu
          respectueux pour la cérémonie, s'élève d'ailleurs de la foule.
                         
                          OFFICIER ANGLAIS
           Tragique, mais glorieux. Qu'il me soit permis de remercier
           plus particulièrement cette année monsieur le maire et
           messieurs les conseillers municipaux pour le magnifique feu
           d'artifice...
                         
          Plan moyen d'Albert et Gabriel longeant la rangée de cabines de
          plage, d'un pas tranquille et un peu trainant.
                         
           OFFICIER ANGLAIS (voix off)
           ... qui a donné à notre pieuse réunion un éclat dont nous
           nous inspirerons désormais. C'est pourquoi je crie, du fond
           du coeur : Vive les États-Unis, Vive l'Angleterre, Vive la
           France !
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - VESTIBULE DE RÉCEPTION - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Marie Fouquet est assise sur une chaise en face du bureau de
          réception, une valise posée à côté d'elle. Elle n'est plus en
          uniforme, mais, par contre, elle porte le pull-over que lui a
          offert son papa. Elle feuillète un magazine. La porte s'ouvre
          lentement. Albert entre, suivi de Gabriel. Marie se lève.
                         
                          MARIE FOUQUET
           Papa ! Que je suis contente !
                         
          Elle monte debout sur la chaise pour embrasser son père. Albert
          referme la porte. Debout sur les premières marches de l'escalier,
          Suzanne regarde son mari.
                         
                          MARIE FOUQUET
           Alors, c'est vrai que tu m'emmènes ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Mais bien sûr que te t'emmène.
                         
          Elle l'embrasse encore, puis se frotte la joue.
                         
                          MARIE FOUQUET
           Dis donc, tu piques !
                         
          Albert se rapproche de Suzanne.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Alors, moi, personne m'embrasse, mais je pique aussi. Je
           vais me raser.
                         
          Il monte deux marches et s'arrête au niveau de Suzanne.
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Euh... bon... ben... Boh, euh... Je prendrai le train de
           quinze heures, quoi.
                         
          Derrière eux, Gabriel est en train d'aider Marie à remettre son
          manteau.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Je savais pas à quelle heure tu rentrerais, j'ai fait
           remonter ta valise, c'est idiot.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ben oui, oh...
                         
          Il monte l'escalier et passe devant Suzanne qui ne bouge pas, mais
          se retourne pour le suivre des yeux.
                         
          DEAUVILLE - PLACE DE LA GARE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Plan moyen de la DS break d'Albert sur le parking de la gare. Il y
          a des valises sur le toit. La porte arrière droite s'ouvre, et
          Gabriel sort, suivi de Marie. Devant eux, Albert sort aussi de la
          voiture. Il porte un manteau et un chapeau, prêt pour une visite
          au cimetière de son père. Gabriel et Albert récupèrent chacun
          leurs valises sur le toit, deux pour Gabriel, et une pour Albert.
          Suzanne, qui était au volant, fait le tour de la voiture. Marie
          s'approche d'elle.
                         
                          MARIE FOUQUET
           Au revoir, madame Quentin.
                         
          Elle lui serre la main.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Au revoir, ma petite Marie.
                         
          Elle se penche et l'embrasse. Gabriel pose une de ses valises, et
          tend la main à Suzanne
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Au revoir, madame, merci pour tout.
                         
          Ils se serrent la main. Gabriel se penche, récupère sa valise et
          s'éloigne avec Marie, qui lui prend la main. Suzanne et Albert se
          regardent.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Je t'attends mardi au train de six heures ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ben, bien sûr.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           T'oubliera pas ton changement à Lisieux ?
                         
          Quelques mètres plus loin, Gabriel a posé ses deux valises en
          attendant Albert.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Tss-tss !... N'aie pas peur.
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Oh, j'ai pas peur. Je regrette que la petite Marie n'ait
           pas vu le feu d'artifice. C'était formidable.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ils sont pas prêts d'en revoir un comme ça, va. Allez, au
           revoir.
                         
          Ils s'embrassent sur les deux joues. Gabriel a récupéré ses
          valises. Albert le rejoint.
                         
          Travelling arrière sur les trois voyageurs qui marchent vers la
          gare, Marie entre les deux hommes. Elle donne la main à son père,
          et timidement, elle tend la main à Albert, qui lui donne la main.
          Derrière eux, Suzanne les regardent s'éloigner. Albert se penche
          et regarde Marie en souriant.
                         
          Fondu enchainé.
                         
          TRAIN - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Plan moyen du compartiment, où ils ne sont que tous les trois,
          Albert et Marie à côté de la vitre, et Gabriel à côté de Marie.
          Marie craque une allumette pour la cigarette de son père. Gabriel
          se penche sur l'allumette pour allumer sa cigarette. Marie souffle
          l'allumette et la jette dans le cendrier sous la vitre. Marie
          regarde Albert.
                         
                          MARIE FOUQUET
           C'est où que tu changes de train ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ben, ça va pas tarder.
                         
                          MARIE FOUQUET
           T'as pas le temps de me raconter une autre histoire ? Juste
           une.
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ben, si tu veux, mais alors, c'est la dernière. Et puis
           elle est vraie, celle-là.
                         
          Il se penche en avant.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Alors, écoute. En Chine, quand les grands froids arrivent,
           dans toutes les rues des villes, on trouve des tas de
           petits singes égarés sans père, ni mère. On sait pas s'ils
           sont venus là par curiosité ou bien par peur de l'hiver,
           mais, comme tous les gens là-bas croient que même les
           singes ont une âme, ils donnent tout ce qu'ils ont pour
           qu'on les ramène dans leurs forêts, pour qu'ils retrouvent
           leurs habitudes, leurs amis.
                         
          Si Marie semble très attentive à l'histoire d'Albert, Gabriel,
          lui, sourit.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et c'est pour ça qu'on voit des trains pleins de petits
           singes qui remontent vers la jungle.
                         
          Albert se cale dans son siège.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ah, on arrive.
                         
          Par la vitre du compartiment, on voit un homme qui passe dans le
          couloir, une valise à la main.
                         
          Marie le regarde passer. Albert remet son chapeau, et se lève. Il
          se penche sur Marie, qui se lève.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Allez, au revoir, ma belle.
                         
          Ils s'embrassent. Gabriel se lève pour l'aider à attraper sa
          valise sur l'étagère au-dessus des sièges.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Non, non, ne vous dérangez pas.
                         
          Il descend sa valise et la pose sur le siège.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Allez, au revoir.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Au revoir.
                         
          Gabriel se lève légèrement. Les deux hommes se serrent la main.
                         
          Gabriel se rassoit. Albert sort dans le couloir.
                         
          GARE DE LISIEUX - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Plan d'ensemble du quai, en travelling avant, comme si la caméra
          était posée sur la locomotive, dont on voit l'avant en premier
          plan. Le train venant de Deauville entre en gare, puis il
          s'arrête.
                         
          TRAIN - INTÉRIEUR JOUR

          la vitre.
                         
          GARE DE LISIEUX - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Plan d'ensemble du quai avec la compartiment de Gabriel en premier
          plan. Gabriel se penche par la vitre de son compartiment. Marie
          apparaît à côté de lui. On voit Albert qui descend du train. Il ne
          se retourne pas vers Gabriel et Marie.
                         
                          MARIE FOUQUET
           Dis, papa, tu crois qu'il en a vu, des singes en hiver ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je pense qu'il en a vu au moins un.

           Lisieux. Les voyageurs pour Rouen, Azincourt (?), Blangy
           changent de train. Correspondance sur le même quai. Départ
           à dix heures...
                         
          Albert s'assoit sur un banc, tournant le dos au train qu'il vient
          de quitter. Il pose sa valise à côté de lui. Il enlève son
          chapeau, qu'il pose sur le banc, met les mains dans ses poches, et
          sort un bonbon de l'une d'entre elles. Il enlève lentement
          l'enveloppe protectrice, sort le bonbon et le met dans sa bouche.
          Derrière lui, le train redémarre. Gabriel et Marie sont toujours à
          la fenêtre de leur compartiment. Ils regardent Albert, qui, lui,
          ne tourne pas la tête pour les regarder.
                         
          Travelling en légère plongée. On a l'impression que la caméra est
          installée dans le compartiment de Gabriel. Sur le quai, Albert ne
          bouge pas, environnée par la fumée provenant de la locomotive. On
          passe devant Albert et la caméra pivote pour rester pointée sur
          lui. Puis on le voit s'éloigner lentement, toujours assis sur son
          banc.
                         
          Sur l'écran, apparaît en lettres majuscules blanches :

INT. CLOTHING STORE - AFTERNOON

Women's casual wear department. J.C. Penny.

Legend "1961"

An African-American man carrying two J.C. Penny shopping bags is ushered past the
department store managers and security guards on walkies that have gathered at
the entrance to the woman's dressing rooms.

								  CUT TO:

INT. DRESSING ROOM - AFTERNOON

A bed has been formed by a chair and three benches.

A STRIKING AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN in her twenties lays across it. Her face and
clothes are covered in sweat. Her skirt is stained.

She holds something wrapped in a soft sweatshirt on her chest. We can't see it,
but WE HEAR THE BABY CRYING.

She's just given birth.

There are three frazzled saleswomen in the dressing room with her. They watch her
with quiet smiles.

A fourth SALESWOMAN arrives ushering in the man with the shopping bags.

				 SALESWOMAN
		This is Mr. Mathison. He's
		a doctor.

DR. MATHISON looks over the scene and then directly at the striking woman.

				 DR. MATHISON
		You okay?

The woman nods, "Yes." Sweat trickles down her face. THE BABY'S PIERCING CRIES
ECHO IN THE SMALL ROOM.

				 SALESWOMAN
		An ambulance is on the way.

Dr. Mathison puts down his shopping bags and moves to her. He kneels down and
gestures for the bundle of sweatshirts in her arms.

				 DR. MATHISON
		Is there a name yet?

Beat. The woman smiles for the first time.

				 WOMAN
		Elijah.

She hands him the wrapped child. We can't see the baby, but THE PIERCING CRIES
SEEM TO GET LOUDER.

				 WOMAN
		Is he supposed to be crying
		like that?

The doctor lowers the baby to his lap and unwraps him.

The woman can't see her baby anymore. She watches Dr. Mathison as he looks down
and examines her child. Beat. Dr. Mathison doesn't look up for the longest time.

				 WOMAN
		Can I have him back?

THE BABY'S CRYING IS RELENTLESS. UNNERVING. Beat.

The doctor finally glances up. He looks shaken. He makes eye contact with the
woman for only a second. It's enough. A chill goes through her body.

He looks to the three saleswomen who were in the room.

				 DR. MATHISON
		What happened during the
		delivery?

His hard stare unsettles the women. The OLDER SALESWOMAN speaks up.

				 OLDER SALESWOMAN
		Nothing. It was very quick.
		The baby just wanted to come
		right out. There was no
		problems.

				 DR. MATHISON
		Did you drop him?

Everyone becomes very still. The mother looks like she stopped breathing. THE
BABY'S SCREAMING ENGULFS THE ROOM.

				 DR. MATHISON
		Did you drop this baby?

Beat.

				 OLDER SALESWOMAN
		Jesus Christ, no.

The BABY SCREAMS.

The doctor whispers something to himself, we can't hear. He looks up to the
saleswoman who brought him in.

				 DR. MATHISON
		Please inform the ambulance
		we have a situation...

Dr. Mathison turns back to the mother. Beat.

				 DR. MATHISON
		I've never seen this... It
		appears your infant
		sustained some fractures
		while in your uterus.
			(beat)
		His arms and legs are
		broken.

								FADE TO BLACK:

EXT. TRAIN STATION NEW JERSEY - DAY

LEGEND "PRESENT DAY"

A fountain of humanity bubbles up from the escalators to the train platform.

Businessmen take their last desperate drags of their cigarettes... Women
traveling with children herd their luggage and offspring into tight shapes as
they move... College students with backpacks look around dazed at the various
track numbers.

				 ANNOUNCER(o.s.)
		Last call track three,
		Amtrak Clocker making it's
		final stop at Philadelphia's
		thirtieth street station.
		First two passenger cars
		only. First two cars only.

A face inside the train watches the stream of passengers emerging from the
escalators. DAVID DUNNE, a man in his early forties, rest his temple against the
glass and quietly observes the movement outside.

The train starts to pull out.

								  CUT TO:

INT. PASSENGER CAR - DAY

David sits with his coat on his lap. He's wearing a tie. He doesn't look very
comfortable in it.

He feels a stare. He looks up to find a girl, six or seven years old, peering at
him from over the seat in front of him. She just gazes at him blankly.

He gives her a small forced smile. She doesn't react. David returns his head to
the window.

His eyes begin to shut with the lulling movement of the train.

				 WOMAN(o.s.)
		You alone?

David looks in the direction of THE VOICE. A WOMAN with dark hair and light blue
eyes stands in the aisle with two bags over her shoulder. She's wearing a tight
white t-shirt and jeans. She's beautiful.

David nods "yes."

The woman starts putting her bags on the shelf above the seats. She stretches to
get them up. Her toned stomach is exposed. She has a silver ring pierced through
her navel.

David has a gold ring on his hand. He fiddles with it. Beat. He gently slips off
his wedding band. It goes into his coat pocket.

The woman takes the seat next to him.

Beat. A LOUD VIOLENT BURST OF SOUND. The passenger car shakes as a passing
train barrels by two feet from David's window. It passes in a few seconds. The
car returns to a QUIET HUM.

David pulls a magazine out from the seat pocket in front of him.

He holds the woman's fashion magazine out.

				 DAVID
		Someone left these. You want
		one?

The woman looks over the one being offered and then points to the Sports
Illustrated peeking out of the seat pocket.

David pulls the magazine out and gives it to her.

				 DAVID
		You like sports?

				 WOMAN
		It's my field. I represent
		athletes. I'm an agent.

				 DAVID
		What a coincidence? I'm a
		male synchronized swimmer
		and I'm looking for
		representation.

				 WOMAN(smiling)
		Is that right?

				 DAVID
		But I'm afraid of water, so
		that's been holding my
		career back a little bit.

The woman laughs.

				 DAVID
		You represent someone in
		Philadelphia?

				 WOMAN
		I'm meeting a player from
		Temple University. He's a
		cornerback. You like
		football?

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Not really.

				 WOMAN
		This kid is six foot two,
		two hundred and forty
		pounds. He runs the fifty in
		under six seconds. He's
		going to be a God.

Beat. David studies the excitement in her eyes.

ANOTHER LOUD VIOLENT BURST OF SOUND. David waits till the opposing train passes.
The woman goes back to her magazine. Beat.

				 DAVID
		I'm David Dunne.

The woman looks up.

				 WOMAN
		Kelly.

She goes back to the magazine.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		How long are you staying in
		Philly?

KELLY looks up from her Sports Illustrated. Her striking blue eyes gaze at David.
Beat.

She holds up her hand. Taps the diamond ring on her finger.

				 KELLY(soft)
		I'm married.

				 DAVID(fake excitement)
		Great.

Beat.

				 KELLY
		Sorry.

				 DAVID(fake confusion)
		What are you talking about?

An awkward silence.

				 DAVID
		I think you got the wrong
		idea.

The woman stares at David. She looks down. Beat. Closes the magazine.

				 KELLY
		I'm going to find another
		seat.

Kelly gets up. She balances herself against a headrest as the train rumbles. She
starts to the back of the car.

David sits alone. He looks like he's drowning, but there's no water.

He feels a stare. He glances up. The little girl spies on him from between the
seats.

David leans towards the window to avoid eye contact. His hand reaches into his
coat and slides out his wedding band. He puts it back on.

His temple touches the glass. The vibration of the train begins to lull his eyes
closed... Beat.

David's head bounces lightly against the window.

The shaking of the glass never allows David's eyes to completely close.

He sits up when he realizes the shaking is getting stronger.

He looks out the window. The scenery blurs as it flies by. Beat.

David turns. Some of the other passengers start to react as they realize the
train is picking up speed.

The normal bumps of the tracks become amplified.

The WORRIED VOICES OF THE TRAVELERS START FILL THE CABIN.

The train goes faster.

AND THEN THE HIGH PITCHED METAL ON METAL SCREECHING STARTS AS THE TRAIN BEGINS TO
TAKE A CURVE.

David's eyes move to the seat in front of him. The little girl is no longer
watching him.

DAVID LOOKS TO THE PASSENGERS ACROSS FROM HIM. He sees the ground slowly drop
away in the windows behind them as THEIR SIDE OF THE TRAIN STARTS TO RISE...

THE PASSENGERS SCREAM AS THE AMTRAK PASSENGER TRAIN BEGINS TO TILT OFF THE
TRACK...

								  CUT TO:

INT. FAMILY ROOM - AFTERNOON

A boy, age ten, sits on his head on the family couch and watches television
upside down. His floppy brown hair spreads out in a circle in front of his red
face. He changes channels with a remote control.

He moves past the upside down cartoons and the upside down talk shows. He stops
on an upside down picture of a crashed train. Beat.

His knees come forward as he flips over. He tumbles slowly off the couch and onto
the carpet. JEREMY DUNNE gazes at the television screen... A LIVE AERIAL VIEW OF
A TRAIN WRECK SMOULDERING BELOW IS SEEN. Two trains are tangled like snakes.

Jeremy gets up and moves to a small table with a phone. Next to the phone is a
notepad. On it is written...

"Dad - Amtrak 177 - 3:40pm."

Jeremy looks at the television. At the bottom of the screen in red block letters
that move from right to left are words and numbers..."The 3:40 Amtrak 177 has
derailed... Amtrak Emergency number is 1-800-777-4322... The 3:40 Amtrak 177 has
derailed...Amtrak"

Jeremy doesn't take his eyes off the screen. He makes a small desperate noise
that no one hears.

								  CUT TO:

INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON

An elderly woman can't hold back any longer and SCREAMS. An embarrassed, tortured
helpless scream.

MEGAN DUNNE continues applying pressure to her arm which is being pushed back as
far as it will go.

She counts to three and eases off. She lays her arm back in her lap.

WE ARE IN A PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER. About a dozen people are on specialized
weight machines.

The elderly woman is seated on an exercise table and breathes slowly.

				 MEGAN
		You okay, Virginia?

Beat. VIRGINIA shakes her head, "No."

				 MEGAN
		I'll put something on the
		t.v. Maybe we'll find some
		almost naked guys to inspire
		you.

Megan reaches up to the t.v. monitor mounted on the wall. She turns it on and
starts flipping channels. She stops on ESPN where a swimming meet is underway.
Men in bikini swimsuits line the edges of the pool.

Virginia starts watching with great interest.

Megan's eyes move to the tiny print moving across the bottom of the screen. Her
face goes still as she reads the train number... 177.

								  CUT TO:

INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - AFTERNOON

DAVID DUNNE'S EYES SLOWLY OPEN. THE DULL WHITE OF THE OVERHEAD TUBE LIGHTING
BLINDS HIM AT FIRST.

He blinks his vision back. He realizes he's in a bed.

WE HEAR AGITATED VOICES, MOVEMENT.

David looks around. He's in an emergency room. There are a half dozen prep areas
and beds next to him. They're all empty.

DAVID FOLLOWS THE URGENT SOUNDS OF ACTIVITY TO A PREP AREA DIRECTLY ACROSS FROM
HIM.

He can only see glimpses of activity through the drawn curtain. A group of
emergency room personnel are treating a man whose body is twitching violently on
a gurney.

One of the group is a man who glances through the opening in the curtain. He
notices David sitting up from across the room.

THE MAN IN SCRUBS leaves the group and walks over.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		How are you feeling?

				 DAVID
		Okay.

He FLASHES A LIGHT in David's eyes.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		You are in the emergency
		room of the University of
		Pennsylvania Hospital. You
		were in a serious accident.
			(beat)
		How's your vision?

				 DAVID
		Fine.

David stares across as the scene with the other patients becomes more frantic and
disturbing.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		Where were you sitting on
		the train?

				 DAVID
		Against a window.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		In the passenger car?

				 DAVID
		Yes. Where are the rest of
		the passengers?

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		Was your family traveling
		with you?

				 DAVID
		No.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		Did you get up from your
		seat?

				 DAVID
		No.

David watches the other patient.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		You're certain you were in
		the passenger car?

David turns to the man.

				 DAVID
		Yes... Why are you looking
		at me like that?

Beat.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		Your train derailed... Some
		kind of malfunction... It
		took a curve way to fast. A
		second train collided with
		yours after it derailed. The
		debris is spread over one
		mile. It's unbelievable they
		said.
			(beat)
		They only found two people
		alive so far... You and him.

David looks to the other passenger now laying unnaturally still in the desperate
whirlwind of activity around him.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		The man's skull was cracked
		open and most of his left
		side was crushed.

Beat.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		And to answer your question,
		there are two reasons why
		I'm looking at you like
		this.

David turns and stares at the man.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		One, because it seems, in a
		few minutes, you will
		officially be the only
		survivor of this train

INT. EMERGENCY RECEPTION AREA - EVENING

David moves through the depressing milky corridors of the hospital. He opens a
set of double doors.

A room crammed with cameras and photographers explodes with movement.

A CHILD'S VOICE BREAKS THEIR NOISE.

				 JEREMY
		I told you!

Jeremy Dunne pushes forward through the mob of people and cameras. He bursts out
and runs to David. He wraps his arms around David's waist. David just stands
there, aware that the cameras are catching it all. He's overwhelmed.

Hospital staff and a couple police officers push the media back.

Jeremy tugs David to lean down. He does.

				 JEREMY
		They thought everybody on
		the train died.

David looks at his son's face. Wipes the tears on his cheek.

				 JEREMY
		I told them they were wrong.

A woman moves to them. David stands up and faces Megan Dunne.

				 JEREMY
		Mom even cried.

David looks at Megan's eyes.

				 JEREMY
		A lot.

Megan looks away.

				 MEGAN
		Not a lot.

They stand there for a moment. David looks shaken. Jeremy takes hold of his hand.

				 JEREMY
		Let's go home.

Megan nods. They move to the exit. The pack of cameras and reporters burst to
life as they leave the building. They jockey for position to get a last glimpse
of David Dunne.

								  CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

David eats a bowl of pasta alone in a modest kitchen. He stares at his hand.
Opens and closes it slowly. Beat.

He rises and puts the bowl away in the sink.

INT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT

David stops just before rising the stairs. He glances into a bedroom at the
bottom of the stairs. The doorway is half open. He makes eye contact with his
wife. Beat.

				 DAVID
		I don't think I got the job
		in New York.

				 MEGAN
		What does that mean?

				 DAVID
		I'm still going to New York.
		Just not this second.

				 MEGAN
		I don't want to drag this
		out too long for Jeremy.

				 DAVID
		I know.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		How about in the meantime,
		you don't sleep in the
		guestroom anymore?
			(beat)
		You sleep in our room. I'll
		sleep down here.

Beat.

				 MEGAN
		It stopped being our room a

		You should go up and get

Beat. Megan slowly closes the door to the guest bedroom.

								  CUT TO:

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

David looks at his son asleep in his bed.

				 DAVID
		Jeremy, why don't you go
		sleep with your mom?

				 JEREMY(eyes closed)
		I want to sleep here

				 DAVID
		I think it's be better if I
		was alone.

				 JEREMY(eyes closed)
		I won't make any noise.

				 DAVID
		How about your room then? If
		you get scared like before,
		you can come back in here?

Beat. Jeremy doesn't answer because he's asleep. David rubs his forehead and gets
up. He turns on the t.v., low volume, as he moves into the bathroom.

								  CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Hot water rushes over David's face as he stands in the shower. His attention is
drawn to the t.v. which is seen through the slightly open bathroom door.

He turns off the water to HEAR.

				 NEWS ANCHOR(t.v.)
		...Derailed approximately
		seven and half miles outside

David steps out of the shower. He sees a glimpse of Jeremy asleep in bed. David
shuts the door. Locks it.

He gets back into the shower and turns the water back on.

He closes his eyes. His face tightens up. He slowly hunches down and takes a seat
on the tiled floor of the shower. Water pours over him. Beat.

His muscular body begins to shake. Then we realize he's crying.

EXT. FAIR - DAY

LEGEND "1969"

A hazy afternoon. A fair has come into town. They have set up in the vast parking
lot of the local high school.

A line of women has formed in front of the portable bathrooms.

The striking African American woman we saw giving birth is now standing in line.
She is older and somehow more beautiful.

She stands with a skinny, almost ethereal looking African American boy. The boy
wears a metal brace on his leg. THE EIGHT YEAR OLD ELIJAH holds two oversized
stuffed animals in his arms. He looks back over his shoulder as THE SOUND OF
VOICES YELLING IN EXCITEMENT FILL THE AIR. His eyes dance over the many colorful
rides in the parking lot.

The door opens to one of the portable bathrooms. A woman steps out.

Elijah's mother touches his head and enters the three foot square plastic
bathroom. She turns back and gives him a look.

				 MOTHER
		We'll play the water pistol
		game next.

Elijah nods, "Yes" happily.

The mother closes the cubicle door. Elijah is left alone amongst the line of
women. They stare at him blankly. Their eyes moves over his leg brace. Elijah
doesn't like it. He moves away from the line.

A CRESCENDO OF CHEERS RISES IN THE AIR FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE FAIR. Elijah follows
the voices. He carries the stuffed animals through the crowds of people. CLICK.
CLICK. CLICK. His metal brace sounds as he walks.

For a moment, he sees nothing but bodies all around him.

He emerges amongst a huddle of teenagers who wait at a turnstile.

A man in a red and white striped coat takes their tickets and waves them in.

Elijah looks up and sees the sign above the turnstile... "The Hurricane."

He watches the teenagers giggle as they each into a grey cup-like seat. They pull
the metal bars down in front of them.

The man in the red and white stripes leaves the turnstile.

Elijah stares up at the multi-colored sign. Beat. He moves quickly. Ducks under
the turnstile and climbs onto the platform.

Elijah finds and empty circular seat. He slips inside the gray metal compartment
and sits. He pulls down the rusted metal bar in front of him.

He looks around at all the excited faces. His eyes fill with excitement too.

His small hands feel the cold metal of the interior of the compartment. His
expression changes.

Elijah looks to the stuffed animals in his arms. He presses them to check their
softness. He places the stuffed animals on either side of him on the seat. He's
wedged in between them. Feels good.

He reaches out and touches the hard rusted metal bar in front of him. Elijah
looks a little anxious. Beat.

He pulls off his sweater and wraps it around the bar. It goes around twice before
he ties the arms together. He checks its softness.

Elijah looks around the customized cup-like compartment he sits in. He smiles an
eight year old smile of pride.

AND THEN HE HEARS HIS MOTHER'S VOICE.

He searches around and finds her walking in the waves of people. He hears her
calling.

				 MOTHER
		Elijah...

She moves in his direction by chance. She finds herself at the entrance to The
Hurricane ride. She looks up at the sign above the turnstile. Her worried eyes
immediately start searching the young faces in the gray circular compartments.

Her eyes meet Elijah's. He waves. Her face goes very still.

A HUGE ROAR OF MACHINERY as the ride starts up.

Elijah yells to his mother as the platform starts running.

				 ELIJAH
		I won't get hurt momma! I'm
		safe!

HIS WORDS GET EATEN UP BY THE CHEERS OF THE TEENAGERS AND THE GRIND OF MACHINERY.

The platform spins. He sees a glimpse of his mother and the red and white striped
man. She's pointing at Elijah.

The platform turns... Elijah sees a flash of the red and white striped man's
angered face as he yells at the frantic woman next to him.

And then the ride speeds up.

The gray circular seats start to spin on their own. The teenagers CHEER.

Elijah's eyes fill with joy as the wind plays against his face.

Suddenly the ride changes directions. The cup-like seats get jerked. Everyone
grabs the metal bars to hold on.

Elijah laughs as he smashes into the stuffed animal on his right. It cushions him
and then falls to the floor of the compartment along with the other stuffed
animal.

Elijah's expression becomes tense as his compartment spins. His hands slide over
the rusted metal bar as the sweater unravels.

Elijah looks around... a sudden panic enters his eyes.

THE BLURRING IMAGE OF HIS MOTHER NOW IN A GROUP OF RED AND WHITE STRIPED MEN.

THE SOUND OF MACHINERY GRINDING IS HEARD as the ride changes directions
suddenly.

Elijah's hands rip away from the bar as he gets thrown to the side of the
compartment. His shoulder and arm takes the brunt of the impact. WE HEAR
SOMETHING CRACK.

TEENAGERS SCREAM IN EXCITEMENT. ELIJAH JOINS THEM WITH SCREAMS OF HIS OWN.

The ride spins its passengers. Elijah's small face looks up at the swirling
clouds in a mixture of agony and terror.

The ride changes directions.

Elijah is thrust forward. He hits the rusted metal bar square against his chest.
WE HEAR MORE CRACKS.

The world spins. Giggles and yells fill the air. Elijah slumps down onto the
floor of the compartment.

And then finally, the grind of the machinery slows and then comes to a gradual
stop.

THE TEENAGERS MOAN.

Elijah is facing directly up at the sky. The clouds now move slowly over him.

WE HEAR COMMOTION. AGITATED VOICES. HIS MOTHER'S DESPERATE VOICE.

				 MOTHER(o.s.)
		His bones... He's not
		well...

HER VOICE GETS LOUDER AS SHE MOVES CLOSER TO THE PLATFORM.

				 MOTHER(o.s.)
		Elijah baby...

Then her face appears as she finds the cup-like seat Elijah is in. She begins to
scream.

Elijah lays on the bottom of the compartment. One arm is clutching his chest. The
other is curved horrifically like an "s". His mouth is open. His eyes are
bulging. The last thing we HERE ARE THE SHORT DESPERATE BREATHS of an eight year
old child about to black out from the pain.

								FADE TO BLACK:

PRESENT: EXT. CHURCH - AFTERNOON

WE EMERGE FROM BLACK to find news vans and reporters lining the street across
from a church. They have been cordoned off by a handful of police. Mourners are
recorded as they emerge from their cars and enter the church.

David is among the arriving crowd.

				 MAN(o.s.)
		David Dunne!

At hearing his name, David turns back as he walks. He can't tell which reporter
called his name because all of them seem to react. A storm of camera movement as
the group jockeys for the best angle of his troubled face.

David passes a magnetic board as he enters the church. It reads, "Services for
the families and friends of train 177."

								  CUT TO:

INT. CHURCH - AFTERNOON

A PRIEST stands before a podium.

				 PRIEST

David sits amongst the mourners in the standing room only church. His eyes drift
to a woman two rows ahead of him. She's turned around, looking at him. Her eyes
are red  from crying.

David looks away. His eyes stop on an old man far to his left just a few seats
away. Father, mother and daughter stare silently.

David surveys the entire church... Desperate inconsolable eyes question his
existence from every direction.

David has to look down.

				 PRIEST
		...Jennifer Pennyman, third
		grade teacher at Jefferson
		Elementary.
			(beat)
		We pray for your soul.

								  CUT TO:

INT. BACK OF CHURCH - AFTERNOON

David and the priest who conducted the mass are alone in the mass preparation
room. The priest looks in his fifties, eyes tired, blood shot.

				 DAVID
		I used to play football in
		college. In my first year as
		quarterback, we went on this
		winning streak. It just went
		on and on. It didn't matter
		who we played... I'd always
		win.
			(beat)
		You get superstitious when
		something like that happens.
		You give things meaning.
		Like you wear the same color
		socks each game or you
		listen to the same B.B. King
		song before you leave the
		apartment. I wouldn't even
		untie the shoelaces on my
		cleats. I'd just slip them
		on and off so nothing would
		change... I gave things
		meaning that had no meaning.
			(beat)
		I'm here to make sure I'm
		not making shoelaces into
		something they're not again.
			(beat)
		I was the only person to
		survive that accident. The
		only one... It feels like it
		means something.

Beat.

				 PRIEST
		Are you a religious man,
		David?

David nods, "No."

The priest removes the sacred stoll from his around his neck and kisses it before
folding it carefully.

				 PRIEST
		Good. Because I'm going to
		talk to you as a man. Not as
		a man of the cloth.

				 DAVID
		Okay.

Beat. The priest turns to David.

				 PRIEST
		It was luck.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		What do you mean?

				 PRIEST
		Luck... Random... Without
		meaning.

David just sits awkwardly.

				 PRIEST
		Three years ago, my cousin
		died on a plane that crashed
		on take off at Philadelphia
		International airport. Do
		you remember that crash?

David nods, "Yes."

				 PRIEST
		I prayed and prayed and
		finally found some meaning
		in the event. It gave me
		peace... And then not quite
		a year later, an entire
		family from my parish burned
		to death in a hotel fire
		downtown...
			(beat)
		Again I prayed. Again I
		found  meaning.
			(beat)
		Just two days ago, my nephew
		rode with you on that train
		back from New York. He was
		traveling alone for the
		first time.

				 PRIEST
		I'm sorry if I can't react
		to your survival with the
		appropriate 'It was the hand
		of God. It was a miracle.'
		kind of answer... I'm fresh
		out of those right now.

David is shaken. Beat.

				 DAVID(soft)
		The metal of the watch I was
		wearing was crushed like a
		sledge hammer hit it.

Beat. The priest's eyes fill with emotion.

				 PRIEST
		My twelve year old nephew's
		neck was broken in four
		places... What's your point?
		You were chosen?
			(beat)
		I don't think so.

The priest turns and continues putting away artifacts from the mass. Silence
fills the back room.

								  CUT TO:

INT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON

No cameras greet his exit. No people anywhere.

David walks across the now empty parking lot. His car is the only one left.

He walks to the driver's side. Pulls out his keys. That's as far as he gets.

His eyes catch sight of the GRAY ENVELOPE tucked under the windshield wiper of
his car.

David moves forward and gently pulls it out. His name is typed on the front. He
turns it over. Two embossed words on the back.

				 "Limited Edition"

He opens the envelope. One line, handwritten, gazes at him from the gray index
card.

The line reads...

  "How many days of your life have you been sick?"

Nothing else is written.

David Dunne looks around the empty parking lot quietly.

								  CUT TO:

INT. EMPLOYEE LOCKER ROOM - MORNING

A poorly lit changing room. A row of metallic lockers sits against one wall. A
bench splits the room. A brown folding table with Dunkin Donuts boxes and bagels
on it is crammed in the corner. A puke colored concrete floor sets the tone.

David and three other large men are changing out of their street clothes. They
all put on the same yellow short sleeve shirts. The same two words are written on
all their backs...

"Stadium Security"

This ritual goes on without a word.

								  CUT TO:

INT. MAIN STADIUM CORRIDOR - MORNING

David walks along the massive curved wall around the outer rim of the stadium. As
he passes the different walkways we get glimpses of the enormous and empty
sixty-thousand seat football stadium on the inside.

David stops at a door marked "PERSONNEL".

								  CUT TO:

INT. PERSONNEL OFFICE - MORNING

David knocks on the door as he steps into the cramped reception room to the
personnel office.

The SECRETARY, an ancient woman with thick flabby arms never stops typing and
never looks up as she talks.

				 ANCIENT SECRETARY
		Yes?

				 DAVID
		Is Noel in?

				 ANCIENT SECRETARY
		No sir he is not.
			(beat)
		I read about you in the
		paper.

				 DAVID
		Oh.

				 ANCIENT SECRETARY
		I was in an accident once
		too. A horse almost trampled
		me to death.

				 DAVID
		Wow.

				 ANCIENT SECRETARY
		I had to put him down.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		That's a sad story.
			(beat)
		Do you think you could ask
		Noel something for me?

The ancient secretary's right hand immediately picks up a pen and positions it
over a blank pad. Her left hand keeps typing. She never looks up.

				 ANCIENT SECRETARY
		Proceed.

				 DAVID
		Ask if he can check how many
		sick days I've taken since
		I've worked here?

Beat.

				 ANCIENT SECRETARY
		Is that the entire message?

				 DAVID
		Yes.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. STADIUM FIELD - AFTERNOON

Rain falls in sheets in the stadium.

David stands at the entrance to a tunnel that empties out onto the field. He
stands in an imposing dark green rain poncho and hood. The poncho almost touches
the ground. The word 'security' on the back has almost faded away. We can barely
see David's face under the hood.

There is a football game in progress on the enormous field. The players seem
unusually small. There is no one in the stands. About four hundred people are on
the sidelines of the field watching the players. A soggy limping banner stretched
behind them declares, "The Pennslvania Elementary School Championships."

David's eyes scan the tiny figures on the field. His eyes come rest on a surge of
activity on the sidelines. Beat.

David steps out into the rain.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. SIDELINES - AFTERNOON

A handful of red faced fathers are yelling at each other. They're in each other's
rain soaked faces. The scene feels on the verge of physical violence.

David and another security guard jog over. David steps in the middle of the tight
circle. The men stop yelling in the presence of stadium security. Everyone just
stands in the rain glaring at each other. Beat.

				 DAVID
		You know what I think about
		to calm down? I think about
		those big fat, hundred and
		twenty pound turtles that
		live in the islands. Those
		suckers never get angry,
		never get in fights and live
		longer than all of us and
		all they do all is sit on
		the beach and hump other
		turtles.
			(beat)
		Why don't we take a second
		and think about the turtles?

Nobody moves. Rain washes over the agitated faces. A father breaks the moment.

				 FATHER
		Yeah Jerry why don't you
		think about the fat ass
		turtles... Like your fat ass
		son on the field
		jeopardizing the rest of our
		chances at a fucking
		championship.

David tenses. Everyone looks to JERRY. A bald man who stands just a foot away.
Jerry nods to himself. Looks like he's going to say something. Instead he lunges
forward and smashes a HEADBUTT to the man who spoke to him.

David tackles Jerry hard and fast. He drives him into the ground.

Blood starts rushing out of the nose of the dazed father who took the headbutt.

The other fathers start yelling and pushing each other. The remaining security
guard calls on his walkie for assistance.

David keeps Jerry immobilized in a powerful arm and head lock that holds the
man's enraged face hard into the wet surface of the field.

David's eyes are not on Jerry. They gaze out onto the field where twenty two
elementary school boys have stopped playing and are standing frozen, helmets off,
rain washing over their faces. They watch in horror as their parents attack each
other on the sidelines.

								  CUT TO:

INT. EMPLOYEE LOCKER ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

David is the last one left. He's showered and back in his street clothes. He sits
in the dimly lit room on the bench, lost in his thoughts when the door opens.

He turns to find a somewhat pregnant looking man with a tie step in. This is
NOEL.

				 DAVID
		Hey Noel.

Beat. He just stares.

				 NOEL
		Forty dollars.

David turns on the bench.

				 DAVID
		What?

				 NOEL
		You're getting a forty
		dollar raise per week...
		that's it.

Silence.

				 NOEL
		I checked. You were right.
		You've never taken a sick

			(beat)
		Five years, no sick days. I

		You made your point.

David is wide awake in his bed. He glances over. Jeremy is in deep sleep next to
him.

								  CUT TO:

INT. GUEST ROOM - NIGHT

David knocks again quietly. The guest bedroom door opens.

Megan looks up at David. She's just woken up.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Is Jeremy okay?

				 DAVID(low voice)
		He's asleep.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Oh.

Beat. They both stand awkwardly for a moment.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		I wanted to ask you a
		question. It'll sound
		strange, but just think
		about it for a second.

Megan nods, "Yes."

				 DAVID(low voice)
		When's the last time I was
		sick? You remember?

Megan tries to mask her reaction to the oddness of the question. Beat.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		I don't know. It's been a
		while.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		I haven't been sick this
		year. I know that.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Okay.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		Do you remember me getting
		sick?

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Not a specific day. What's
		this about?

				 DAVID (low voice)
		Megan, do you ever remember
		me getting sick?

Beat.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		In the three years we've
		been in this house?... In
		the old apartment?... Before
		Jeremy was born?... Before
		we were married?

Beat.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		...I can't remember.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		That's strange isn't it? Not
		remembering one fever... Or
		a cold... Or a sore throat.
		What do you think that
		means?

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		It means we're probably to
		tired to remember.

David becomes quiet as he thinks. Beat.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Is that what you wanted to
		ask me?

				 DAVID(low voice)
		Yes.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Is there anything else you
		wanted to ask me while I'm
		up?...

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		...When was the last time
		you wore pink? When was the
		last time you drank soup
		standing up? Final call for
		strange questions at two in
		the morning.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		No that's it.

David seems lost in his thoughts.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Maybe you should go up.
		Jeremy might see you're gone
		and get frightened.
			(beat)
		The train thing, really
		shook him up. He's scared
		something's going to happen
		to you. He doesn't want to
		let you out of his sight.

David stares at Megan. Beat.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		Yeah. I know.

There's silence for a bit.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		When was the last time I
		wore pink?

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		The Mitchell barbecue three
		years ago.

				 DAVID(realizing)
		Oh shit...

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Matching shirt and shorts.
		It was brutal.

David half-smiles as Megan turns and starts back into the guest room.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		Goodnight Megan.

Megan looks back at her husband. Just for a moment. Then she looks down.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Goodnight David.

Megan closes the door slowly shut.

								FADE TO BLACK:

INT. BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

WE EMERGE in a cramped sparse bedroom.

LEGEND "1974"

A thirteen year old Elijah sits in a chair with his arm in a sling. He watches a
small black and white television in the corner of the room.

WE HEAR FOOTSTEPS. Elijah's mother walks into the room. She looks around for a
moment, and then moves to the television. Turns it off.

The room GOES SILENT.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		No more sitting in this
		room. I've let it go on long
		enough.

				 ELIJAH
		I'm not going out anymore.
		I'm not getting hurt again.
		This was the last time. I
		told you.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		You can't do anything about
		that. You might fall between
		that chair and this
		television. If that's what
		God has planned for you,
		that's what's going to
		happen. You can't hide from
		it in your room.

Elijah just sits staring at the dark television screen.

				 ELIJAH
		They call me Mr. Glass at
		school. Cause I break like
		glass.

Elijah's face is tense. Unyielding. Beat.

Elijah's mother says the next words in almost a whisper.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		...You make this decision
		now to be afraid...
			(beat)
		And you'll never turn back
		your whole life. You'll
		always be afraid.

Elijah's eyes move from the television to his mother. He sees the emotion in her
face. Neither says anything for a while. Beat.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		...I got a present for you.

				 ELIJAH
		Why?

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		Forget why. Do you want it
		or not?

Elijah thinks it over. He nods, "Yes."

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		Well, go get it then.

				 ELIJAH
		Where is it?

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		On a bench, across the
		street.

Elijah looks at his mother with disbelief.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		You calling me a liar?

She points to the window. Beat. Elijah gets up and moves to the only window in
the room.

The view from his room looks out over a narrow street. On the other side of the
street is a public playground. A handful of children are playing on it.

There are three benches to one side of the swings. On one of them is a THIN
PACKAGE wrapped in brown paper with a bow on it.

Elijah looks to his mom who has joined him at the window.

				 ELIJAH
		Someone's gonna take it.

Beat.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		Then you better get out
		there soon.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. PLAYGROUND - AFTERNOON

Elijah walks across the playground. He's very wary of the other children running
about him.

He walks towards the bench with the present on it. Takes a seat. Puts the package
on his lap. It's flat. The edges of the bend down over his thin legs.

He undoes the white bow. He peels off the clear tape holding the brown paper
together. He unfolds the paper. Beat.

Elijah stares down at the single comic book in his lap.

He feels the shadow of his mother. She takes a seat next to him.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		I bought a whole bunch.
		They'll be one of these
		waiting for you, every time
		you want to come out here.

Beat.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		They said this one has a
		surprise ending.

Elijah looks to his mother. His intelligent piercing eyes take her in for a
moment.

He looks back down at his lap. He opens the first page...

						DISSOLVE TO:

INT. STORE - DAY

The same intelligent piercing eyes, twenty-five years older. Elijah has grown
into a handsome, regal looking man. He leans on a walking stick.

He's looking at an impressively framed charcoal sketch on a wall. Two figures are
depicted on the top of a building locked in fierce battle. One figure is
extremely muscular with a mask. The other is half human, half animal.

				 MAN
		This is from Fritz
		Champion's own library. This
		is before the first issue of
		the comic book hit the
		stands in 1968.

Elijah glances at the BUSINESS MAN standing next to him and then back to the
sketch.

				 ELIJAH
		It's a classic depiction of
		good versus evil. Notice the
		square jaw of Slayer -
		common in most comic book
		heroes. And the slightly
		disproportionate size of
		Jaguaro's body to his head.
		This again is common, but
		only in villains... The
		thing to notice about this
		piece... The thing that
		makes it very, very
		special... is its realistic
		depiction of its figures.
		When the characters
		eventually made it into the
		magazine they were
		exaggerated... as always
		happens.
			(beat)
		This is vintage.

The business man rubs his face. Gazes at the sketch. Beat.

				 BUSINESS MAN
		Wrap it up.

				 ELIJAH
		You've made a considerably
		wise decision.

Elijah starts to the back of the store which we now see is some type of art
gallery where all the framed pictures are images and sketches from comic books.

				 BUSINESS MAN
		My kid's gonna go berserk.

Elijah jams his walking stick into the extra thick carpet and stops. He turns.

				 ELIJAH
		Once again please?

				 BUSINESS MAN
		My son Jeb. It's a gift for
		him.

				 ELIJAH
		How old is Jeb?

				 BUSINESS MAN
		Four.

				 ELIJAH
		No.

Elijah starts back to the businessman shaking his head strongly.

				 ELIJAH
		No, no, no, no no... You
		need to go now.

				 BUSINESS MAN
		What did I say?

				 ELIJAH
		Do you see any Telletubbies
		around here?... Do you see
		a slender plastic tag
		clipped to my shirt with my
		name printed on it?... Do
		you see a little Asian child
		with a blank expression
		sitting outside in a
		mechanical helicopter that
		shakes when you put a
		quarter in it?... No?...
		Well that's what you see at
		a toy store? Any you must
		think this is a toy store,
		cause you're in here
		shopping for an infant named
		Jeb. One of us has made a
		gross error and wasted the
		other person's valuable
		time...

Elijah's eyes pierce through the shaken man.

				 ELIJAH
		This is an art gallery my
		friend. This is piece of
		art...

Elijah points at the sketch.

				 ELIJAH
		This is one of seventeen
		original drawings by Fritz
		Champion remaining in the
		world. It's value will
		triple every year... This
		piece is to be treasured. To
		be cherished... To be
		coveted by every single one
		of your banker friends that
		think they're better than
		you.

The business man stares at the sketch with large eyes. Beat.

				 BUSINESS MAN
		What if I kept it?

Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		I'm listening.

				 BUSINESS MAN
		I'll keep it in my office
		room.

				 ELIJAH
		What about Jeb?

				 BUSINESS MAN
		I have a lock on the door.

Elijah just stares.

				 ELIJAH
		Will it be near a window?

				 BUSINESSMAN
		No direct sunlight will fall
		on it.

Elijah eyes the man for many seconds. Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		Come back in three days.
		I'll think about it.

Elijah starts to the back. He passes the front door as two customers walk in.
Elijah talks over his shoulder to them.

				 ELIJAH
		We're by appointment only.

				 MAN
		I received a card from your
		store.

				 ELIJAH
		Congratulations, you have a
		mailbox... The sale isn't
		for two weeks.

				 MAN
		This one was under the
		windshield of my car.

Elijah turns and faces the customers for the first time. David Dunne stands with
Jeremy.

Elijah just stands staring for the longest time. Beat. He walks closer to them.
When Elijah speaks, his voice has a whispery quality to it.

				 ELIJAH
		You've never been sick?

				 DAVID
		I don't know for sure.
			(beat)
		...I don't think so.

David and Elijah quietly look at each other. Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		Well if this ain't a riddle
		worthy of the Riddler?

								  CUT TO:

EXT. LIMITED EDITION - LATE AFTERNOON

Three chairs have been placed on the walkway in front of the bay window of the
store. The words, "Limited Edition" are etched in the window.

David, Jeremy and Elijah are seated watching the people stroll by. Elijah's cane
is on his lap.

Jeremy sips a drink in a paper cup.

				 ELIJAH
		So let's get some of the
		usual questions out of the
		way. Why am I using a cane?
		Raise your hand if you were
		thinking that.

Jeremy raises his hand.

				 ELIJAH
		I fractured my leg. It's the
		fifth time I've done that
		particular bone. It didn't
		really heal well this time.

				 ELIJAH
		Raise your hand is you're
		wondering who the hell
		breaks the same bone five
		times?

Jeremy and David raise their hands.

				 ELIJAH
		I have something called
		Osteogenesis Imperfecta.
		It's a genetic disorder. I
		don't make this particular
		type of protein very well
		and it makes my bones very
		low in density, very easy to
		break. I've had fifty-four
		breaks in my life. I have
		the tamest version of the
		disorder... Type one.
			(beat)
		There are type two, type
		three, and type four. Type
		four's don't make it very
		long...
			(beat)
		That ends our lecture on the
		medical anomaly known as
		Elijah Price.

Elijah stares at his two rapt listeners.

				 ELIJAH
		How certain are you that you
		haven't been sick in your
		life?

				 DAVID
		Seventy-five percent.

				 ELIJAH
		Seventy-five percent? That's
		not nearly good enough for
		me. I'm extremely skeptical.

				 DAVID
		Skeptical about what?

				 ELIJAH
		Your answer to my question.
		It's one thing to have never
		been injured in your life,
		but to state that you've
		never taken ill, well that's
		a whole new level.

				 JEREMY
		Dad's been injured.

Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		What's he talking about?

				 DAVID
		In college. A car accident.

				 ELIJAH
		Was it serious?

David nods.

				 JEREMY
		He couldn't play football
		anymore.

Beat. Elijah looks shaken.

				 ELIJAH
		I assumed because of the
		train.

				 DAVID
		You assumed wrong.

Elijah closes his eyes. When his eyes open, the life force in them has
diminished. Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		It's over.
			(beat)
		You can go now.

Elijah uses his cane to get up and walk back through the doors of the store.

INT. LIMITED EDITION - LATE AFTERNOON

David and Jeremy enter the store. Elijah leans on a walking stick before one of
the framed sketches. He gazes at it quietly.

				 DAVID
		I think you skipped a couple
		steps.

Elijah turns.

				 DAVID
		You forgot the "Now I'm
		going to tell you what the
		hell is going on" step. See
		usually that comes before
		the, "It's over" Step. And
		it always, always comes
		before the "You can go"
		Step.
			(beat)
		What is over?

				 ELIJAH
		The life of an idea that has
		lived too long in my head.

David stares at Elijah impatiently.

				 ELIJAH
		There are probably only four
		or five individuals in the
		world who can claim more
		knowledge of comics than
		myself. I've spent a third
		of my life in a hospital bed
		with nothing else to do but
		read. I have studied the
		form intimately. I have seen
		the patterns in them... The
		references to social and
		cultural events and the
		atmosphere that surrounded
		them. I've come to believe
		that comics are our last
		link to the ancient way of
		passing on history.

				 ELIJAH
		The Egyptians drew pictures
		on walls about battles, and
		events. Countries all around
		the world still pass on
		knowledge through pictorial
		forms.
			(beat)
		I believe that comics, just
		at their core now... have a
		truth. They are depicting
		what someone, somewhere felt
		or experienced. Then of
		course that core got chewed
		up in the commercial machine
		and gets jazzed up, made
		titillating - cartooned for
		the sale rack.

Elijah gazes at David.

				 ELIJAH
		This city has had its share
		of disasters. Well
		publicized ones. It was
		around the time of that
		plane crash, when it first
		entered my head. And there
		it stayed, as I waited and
		watched the news over the
		years...
			(beat)
		And then one day I see a
		news report on a train
		accident and its sole
		survivor who was
		miraculously unharmed.
			(soft)
		And just like that, an idea
		blossoms into the flower of
		possible reality.

				 DAVID
		What was your idea Elijah?

Beat.

				 ELIJAH(soft)
		If there is someone like me
		in the world, and I'm at one
		end of the spectrum...
		Couldn't there be someone
		the opposite of me, at the
		other end?
			(beat)
		A person who can't be hurt
		like the rest of us. A kind
		of person they were talking
		about in those stories.

Elijah points at the framed comic sketches.

				 ELIJAH(soft)
		A person they believed was
		put here to protect the rest
		of us. Guard us.

				 JEREMY
		You thought my dad was a
		real-

				 DAVID
		Jeremy don't take another
		sip of that drink.

Jeremy looks down at the paper cup in his hands.

				 DAVID
		Throw it in the trashcan
		near the door and wait for
		me outside. Do it now
		please.

David waits for Jeremy to exit the store. Beat.

				 DAVID
		At the church... You were
		following me weren't you?

				 ELIJAH
		Technically no. I gambled
		that you would attend the
		church service. I just
		waited for you.

David glares at Elijah.

				 DAVID
		What's this about? This is
		obviously some scam. Is this
		where you tell me one of
		those pictures is like an
		investment?

				 ELIJAH
		You've misunderstood.

				 DAVID
		I see guys like you all the
		time in my work. You find
		someone you think is
		emotionally vulnerable and
		you tell them a fantastic
		story, utterly convincing...
		and somewhere in there, you
		slip it in... 'I just need
		your credit card number','I
		just need a small down
		payment.'

David shakes his head. He smiles out of frustration. Beat.

				 DAVID
		Did you know that this
		morning was the first
		morning I can remember, that
		I didn't open my eyes and
		feel that sadness... Do you
		know what I'm talking about?
		That little bit of sadness?
			(beat)
		I thought the person that
		wrote that note had an
		answer for me. For why I
		survived that train. For why
		my life feels so out of
		balance...
			(beat)
		But I guess that's what you
		were counting on.

Elijah stares carefully at David. Beat. David glances over to the entrance.
Jeremy watched through the window concerned.

				 DAVID
		I'm going to leave now.
			(beat)
		Good luck with your sale.

Elijah watches David walk towards the front door.

				 ELIJAH
		What type of job do you have
		David?

David opens the door. He looks back at Elijah.

				 ELIJAH
		You mentioned you've met
		'guys like me' in your work.
			(beat)
		What type of job would that
		be?

Beat.

				 DAVID
		I work at the stadium as a
		security guard.

Beat. David closes the door behind him. Elijah watches through the window as
Jeremy takes David's hand as they cross the street.

Elijah gazes out the window in a bit of a daze.

								  CUT TO:

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

ALL LIGHTS ARE OUT EXCEPT THE SMALL BEDSIDE LAMP ON DAVID'S SIDE.

David sits up in bed staring at a torn section of newspaper in his hands.

Jeremy is asleep horizontally with his legs over David's legs.

David doesn't blink as he gazes at the headline silently...

  "TRAIN CRASH DEATH TOLL CONFIRMED AT 131 DEAD. 1 SURVIVOR"

Beat. David slides out from under his son's legs. Jeremy stirs but doesn't wake
up.

David moves to the darkness of the corner of the room. He opens a closet door.

A NAKED HANGING BULB GOES ON as David yanks a chain. David steps inside the
narrow closet and closes the door slightly so the LIGHT FROM THE BULB DOESN'T
FALL ON JEREMY.

There's just enough room to stand and look around. David reaches up and pulls a
small travel bag out of the way. David stretches as he feels on the top shelf.

His hand comes down with something wrapped in a t-shirt. He unwraps it. It's a
handgun.

He stares at it for a beat before wrapping it back up and replacing it to the
highest shelf.

He stretches even more. Reaches farther back. WE HEAR SOMETHING SLIDE ON THE
SHELF AS HE PULLS IT FORWARD.

He pulls down a folder jammed with clippings. He opens the folder to reveal a
young David in football uniform holding his helmet in the air victoriously. The
word "Champion" is written over his head. David flips through the top clippings
- all are images and stories of David and football.

He turns the pile over. Goes to the last clipping. This piece of paper is folded
over three times, unlike the others. He opens it.

It's a newspaper headline. It reads...

"CAR ACCIDENT LEAVES TWO INJURED"

David puts the new headline next to the old one... They look like a set. Even the
font is similar.

David stares at the old headline. Stares hard at the photo of the bent and
heavily damaged car laying upside down in the middle of the highway... The bulb
seems to flicker. David is utterly still.

SOMEONE KNOCKS AT THE BEDROOM DOOR. David gets startled.

He puts back the clippings. Stuffing the new one inside with them. He replaces it
back to the top shelf and leaves the closet.

ANOTHER SOFT SET OF KNOCKS as David moves across the bedroom. He opens the door.

Megan stands in the darkened hall. Beat.

				 DAVID(whisper)
		Hi.

Megan nods. Beat.

				 MEGAN(whisper)
		I've come to a decision.

				 DAVID(whisper)
		Oh.

Beat.

				 MEGAN(whisper)
		Let me just ask you
		something okay? And you can
		be totally honest. I'm
		prepared for any answer. It
		won't affect me...

David nods, "yes."

				 MEGAN(whisper)
		Have you been with anyone?
		Since we started having
		problems? The answer won't
		affect me.

Beat. David stares at his wife.

				 MEGAN(whisper)
		It won't affect me either
		way.

Beat. David doesn't say anything. He just nods, "No."

Megan's face starts to tremble. She starts crying. Tears roll over her very
affected face. She tries to wipe them away, but there's too many. Beat.

				 MEGAN(soft)
		...My decision is... I'd
		like to start again. Pretend
		we're at the beginning.
			(beat)
		It's a big deal you walked
		away from that train. It's
		a second chance.
			(beat)
		If you want to ask me out
		sometime, that would be
		okay.

Megan nods and walks down the stairs as she wipes her face. David watches her
disappear into the shadows.

						DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  VETERAN'S STADIUM - AFTERNOON

Sunday afternoon. The cavernous stadium opens up into a picture perfect blue sky.
The Philadelphia Eagles pro football players are in uniform and doing stretches
on the field. The opposing team warms up on the other end of the field.

The sixty thousand seats are already half filled as fans stream in on every level
of the stadium.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. ENTRANCE GATE 27B - AFTERNOON

A line of ticket holders snakes towards two turnstiles where stadium crew are
ripping tickets.

David Dunne stands to one side with two other security guards.

The fans moving through the turnstiles are clad in all types of Eagles
paraphernalia. A group of girls carries a homemade banner that David reads as he
tilts his head sideways. "We sleep with quarterbacks," is written in block
letters.

David stares at a woman carrying a newborn infant in her arms. The baby is
wearing an eagles uniform.

The WALKIE TALKIE on David's hip bursts to life. He pulls it off his hip an
listens.

				 WALKIE
		Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got
		a guy at gate 17C with a
		bogus ticket. Says he knows
		you. He won't tell me his
		name.

				 DAVID(into walkie)
		What's he look like?

				 WALKIE
		He's got the most beautiful
		eyes... The hell kind of
		question is that? He's a
		guy.

				 DAVID(into walkie)
		Send him packing. I'm not
		walking all the way over
		there.

				 WALKIE
		Consider him packed. I
		didn't like his attitude...
		Struttin around with a cane
		and shit.

Beat.

				 DAVID(into walkie)
		Hold up Jenkins...

								  CUT TO:

EXT. ENTRANCE GATE 17C - AFTERNOON

David finds Elijah waiting to the side as the crowds funnel through the gate.
Elijah offers his hand as he walks up. David doesn't take it.

				 ELIJAH
		They said I couldn't get in
		with my ticket.

Elijah offers him the ticket. David inspects it.

				 DAVID
		It's for last week's game.

				 ELIJAH
		I've come to understand
		that...
			(beat)
		An ill advised purchase in
		the parking lot.

David hands Elijah back the ticket.

				 DAVID
		What do you want?

				 ELIJAH
		Not money.
			(beat)
		But I appreciate your
		healthy cynicism in the
		manner. It will be wise for
		both of us to proceed with
		greatest caution.

				 DAVID
		We're not proceeding
		anywhere together.

				 ELIJAH
		We've already begun.

David looks around.

				 DAVID
		One more time. What is it
		you want?

Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		Why is it, do you think,
		that of all the professions
		in the world... you chose
		protection?

				 DAVID
		Are you for real?

				 ELIJAH
		You could have poured coffee
		in Starbucks, you could have
		learned to install track
		lighting in office
		buildings, you could have
		told people their horoscopes
		on the internet... You could
		have been one of ten
		thousand things... but in
		the end, you chose to
		protect people. You made
		that decision... and I find
		that very, very interesting.
			(beat)
		Now all I need is your
		credit card number.

Beat. Elijah smiles.

				 ELIJAH
		That last part was a joke.

David fights it. But he smiles anyway. Beat.

				 DAVID
		I got this job because my
		college coach called the guy
		who manages the stadium.
		There's no hidden meaning to
		it.

David's walkie makes NOIES on his hip.

				 DAVID
		They need me at the gate.

David stares at Elijah leaning on his walking stick.

				 DAVID
		Did you really want to see
		the game? I can get you in.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. ENTRANCE GATE 27B - AFTERNOON

The line of fans outside the gate has tripled in size and intensity.

David and Elijah move along the line towards the turnstiles.

				 DAVID
		It gets heaviest ten minutes
		before kickoff.

David bumps a guy in line wearing an army jacket. David looks backs at him and
continues walking.

David moves to a security guard near the turnstiles.

				 DAVID
		Why don't we pat down?

David walks to his post near the gate and faces the crowd. Elijah moves next to
him.

				 DAVID
		Just give me a minute.

				 ELIJAH
		Is there a problem?

				 DAVID
		That guy in green. Sometimes
		people carry weapons in
		here. Then they drink too
		much. They're team isn't
		doing so well, bad things
		happen... We do random pat
		downs of the crowd to
		discourage people from
		carrying.
			(beat)
		If he's carrying, he'll step
		out of line.

Elijah observes as a security team pats down random males as they move through
the turnstiles.

The GREEN ARMY JACKETED MAN moves forward in the line. His face is blank as he
watches the pat down ahead of him. He's twenty people from the turnsstile.

David eyes him. Fifteen people away... Ten...

The man coughs and steps out of the line. Elijah watches the green army jacket
melt into the thick part of the crowd and disappear as it moves away from the
stadium.

								  CUT TO:

INT. STADIUM TUNNEL - AFTERNOON

AN UNLIT arched concrete passageway. The SUNLIGHT from the stadium streams in
causing long shadows.

Elijah stands waiting in the ground tunnel by himself.

THE THUNDEROUS CHEERS OF THE SIXTY THOUSAND FANS IN THE STADIUM ECHOES FROM THE
FIELD INTO THE TUNNEL.

David enters the tunnel and joins Elijah. He hands him a ticket.

				 DAVID
		I got you a seat in the
		seven hundred level.
			(points straight up)
		It's nose-bleed territory,
		but at least you won't get
		spit on.

				 ELIJAH
		How did you know that man
		you bumped was carrying a
		weapon?

				 DAVID
		Probably the army jacket.
		Those guys carry hunting
		knives and stuff for show.

				 ELIJAH
		You thought he was carrying
		a knife?

Beat.

				 DAVID
		I thought he was carrying
		something.

				 ELIJAH
		But not a knife?

				 DAVID
		I got this picture of a
		silver handled gun tucked in
		his pants.
			(beat)
		Like on t.v.

Elijah stares at David. THE STADIUM CHEERS BOUNCE OFF THE GRAY WALLS.

				 ELIJAH
		You have good instincts when
		it comes to things like
		that?

				 DAVID
		Like what?

				 ELIJAH
		Telling when people have
		done something wrong?

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Yes.

				 ELIJAH
		Have you ever tried to
		develop it?

				 DAVID
		I don't know what you're
		asking?

				 ELIJAH
		You're skill.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Listen. I got to be on the
		sidelines during the game...
		You can get to your seat by
		taking the stairwell at-

				 ELIJAH
		Characters in comic books
		are often attributed special
		powers. X-ray vision, things
		of that sort.

David exhales slowly as he stares at Elijah.

				 DAVID
		Okay, I don't want to play
		this game anymore.

				 ELIJAH
		It's an exaggeration of the
		truth. Maybe it's based on
		something as simple as
		instinct. Like being able to
		touch someone and tell
		whether they've done
		something wrong... Or the
		level of what they've done
		wrong.

				 DAVID
		The guy might not have been
		carrying anything.

				 ELIJAH
		Or he might have been
		carrying a silver handled
		gun tucked in his pants.

David's WALKIE ERUPTS WITH NOISE.

				 DAVID
		I have to go now.

				 ELIJAH
		One last question.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Quick.

				 ELIJAH
		The car accident you were
		in... Was there anyone else
		involved?

The two men stand very still in the tunnel.

				 DAVID
		Yes. My wife Megan. She was
		in the car with me.

David turns and starts down the hall. David talks back over his shoulder.

				 DAVID
		Have a good life Elijah and
		try to buy your tickets at
		an authorized sales
		location.

Elijah watches as the silhouetted figure of David Dunne jogs down the darkness of
the tunnel.

								  CUT TO:

INT. CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

We are inside a customized car. The dashboard is covered in some sort of thin
foam padding. The steering wheel and gear shift have the same padding. Every
corner and hard surface has been safe guarded. Elijah sits behind the wheel of
his car in the parking lot of the stadium. He sits as thoughts crash at his head.
Beat.

He finally reaches for the keys and starts up the car. He looks into the rearview
mirror and sees the man in the GREEN ARMY JACKET pass behind his car.

Elijah quickly turns and sees the man moving through the parked cars heading out
of the parking lot.

Elijah takes a deep breath and turns off the engine.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON

Elijah's walking stick makes RHYTHMIC CLICKS on the concrete parking lot.

The figure in the army jacket seems to move farther away with every step.

Elijah starts breathing harder. He pushes himself to move faster. He avoids the
hard chrome bumpers and tailpipes that jut out from the cars as he quickens his
pace through the lot.

He gains on the army jacket.

				 ELIJAH(calls out)
		Hold up for a second!

The man in the army jacket turns as he reaches a subway entrance that marks the
end of the parking lot. He looks back at Elijah for a beat. Doesn't like what he
sees. He disappears into the subway entrance.

Elijah quickens into a jog now. He hasn't done this in a while and it's painful.
He makes it with great strain to the subway.

He looks into the entrance...

A steep flight of stairs leads to the subway floor. The tail of the army jacket
is glimpsed before it disappears.

Elijah breathes hard as he takes hold of the railing.

				 ELIJAH(calls out)
		I just want to ask you
		something!

Elijah's VOICE ECHOES down the stairs. No response.

Elijah starts his descent.

THE SOUND OF A SUBWAY PULLING IN ROARS UP THE STAIRS.

Elijah has to move fast. He takes the steps with less and less hesitation. He's
moving with great agility... and then his foot catches on a step.

His hand slips away from the railing...

He falls down the remaining part of the stairs. The FIRST SICKENING CRACK is
heard when his hand reaches out to stop his fall.

The SECOND CRACK IS MORE LIKE A CRUNCH AS HIS LEG LANDS AWKWARDLY ON THE METAL
STAIRS.

He comes to a stop in a pile on the dirty gum stained floor of the subway
landing. His jaw is locked in a HORRIFIC SCREAM THAT GETS EATEN BY THE ROAR OF
THE SUBWAY TRAIN PULLING IN.

His contorted anguished face sees the turnstiles of the subway upside down. The
green army jacketed man looks back at Elijah with a blank expression pushing
through the turnstile.

The last thing Elijah sees before he blacks out, is the tail of the man's coat
riding up as he move through the turnstile. The SILVER HANDLE OF A GUN peeks out
from the belt of his pants.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. BUS STOP - DUSK

David's neighborhood turns crimson as the day comes to an end. The Septa bus
pulls to a stop in front of a public high school. David steps off, still in his
security clothes. The bus pulls away as he hears his SON'S VOICE.

David turns to the high school football field behind him. A group of children are
having a touch football game. Jeremy runs out from the huddle across the field to
David.

				 JEREMY
		Was it sold out?

David nods, "No."

				 DAVID
		You know how mad your mom
		would be if she knew you
		were playing football?

Jeremy nods.

				 JEREMY
		Are you going to tell?

David nods, "No."

				 JEREMY
		You want yo play the last
		downs? We got a big guy like
		you. You can play on
		opposite sides.

David looks to the fields to see a very muscular college age man in sweats who
stands with the other children.

				 JEREMY
		He's Potter's cousin. He's
		the starting corner back for
		Temple University.

David stares at his son.

				 JEREMY
		He going pro in the draft.
		They say he can run the
		fifty-

				 DAVID
		In under six seconds.
			(beat)
		I've heard.

David watches the cornerback being surrounded by kids. He's letting a couple of
the kids feel his flexed bicep.

				 DAVID
		I'm going to go in.

				 JEREMY
		Just play one set of downs.
		I told them you were great.

				 DAVID
		Why'd you do that?

				 JEREMY
		Just one-

				 DAVID
		Jeremy.
			(beat)
		I'm going in. I have to do
		some things.

				 JEREMY
		What things?

				 DAVID
		I'm going to work out.

				 JEREMY
		I'll help you.

				 DAVID
		There's nothing to do.

Jeremy turns back to the children and waves.

				 JEREMY(yells)
		I can't play! I'm working
		out with my dad!

Jeremy turns back to his father and takes his hand. David looks down at his son
who waits patiently.

The basement is dominated by storage boxes and Christmas decorations. An old
bench press and weights are in a cluttered corner.

David sits and turns at the end of the bench as Jeremy laboriously carries and
places fifteen a pound weight on the bar. David talks over his shoulder.

				 DAVID
		Why don't you rest now? I'll
		take it from here. You've
		been a big help.

Jeremy goes to the opposite side of the bar and starts to put on another weight.

				 JEREMY
		You think you could beat up
		Mike Tyson? I mean before he
		started wiggin out and
		eating people's ears?

				 DAVID
		No.

				 JEREMY
		What if you worked out
		everyday for six months? You
		think you could beat him
		then?

				 DAVID
		No.

				 JEREMY
		What if you only ate foods
		that were good for you and
		you worked out everyday for
		a year?

Jeremy is breathing hard as he puts the safety collars on the barbell and comes
around to David's end of the bench. David lays back.

				 DAVID
		No.

David takes hold of the barbell. Beat. He takes a deep breath.

The weight comes off the armrests of the bench. David lowers it to his chest and
pushes it back up. He does just one more rep with serious strain. He puts the
weight back on the armrest and sits up.

				 DAVID
		How much did you put on
		there?

David twists around and looks back at the barbell. He counts up the black metal
circles. He turns back to Jeremy.

				 DAVID
		You put too much. That's two
		hundred and fifty pounds.

				 JEREMY
		How much can you lift?

David looks back at the weights.

				 DAVID
		That's the most I've ever
		lifted.
			(beat)
		That could have been
		dangerous Jeremy. Why don't
		you go upstairs and let me
		finish up?

Jeremy starts back to the barbell.

				 JEREMY
		I'll take it off. I'll help
		you right.

He slips off the safety collar.

				 JEREMY
		You think you could have
		beaten up Bruce Lee?

David hears the SOUND OF THE WEIGHTS SLIDING OFF THE BAR BEHIND HIM.

				 DAVID
		No.

				 JEREMY
		I mean if you knew karate?

				 DAVID
		No Jeremy.

				 JEREMY
		What if he wasn't aloud to
		kick and you were really mad
		at him?

Jeremy is breathing hard again as he finishes with the weights and comes around
to David.

David lays back.

				 DAVID
		No.

David takes hold of the bar. Lifts it off the armrest. Brings it down. His arms
are straining hard again. He raises it and lowers it two time; it takes a sizable
effort. The weights bang down onto the armrest.

David sits up.

				 DAVID
		How much did you take off?

				 JEREMY
		I lied.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		You added?

Jeremy nods, "Yes" slowly.

David turns completely around and looks at the barbell. He counts the black discs
on the steel bar. Beat.

Nobody says anything for a long time.

				 JEREMY(soft)
		How much is it?

				 DAVID(soft)
		Two hundred and seventy.

David just stares at the black steel circles on the metal bar. Jeremy comes and
sits on the bench next to his father. They both stare at the weight. Beat.

				 JEREMY(dead serious)
		Let's put more.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Okay.

								  CUT TO:

INT. BASEMENT - EARLY EVENING

David's fingers wrap around the cold metal of the bar. He leans his head forward
and looks to Jeremy.

				 DAVID
		Why don't you move back a
		bit? Just to be safe.

Jeremy moves back to the bottom of the stairs leading up to the house. He waits.

Another deep breath as David heaves. The weight CLINKS as it comes off the arm
rest. David is full out straining now as he lowers and raises it. His arms begin
to tremble as he lifts it for the second time. BANG the weight lands back safely
onto the rest.

David sits up. He looks at his son whose eyes are wide. Beat.

				 JEREMY
		More?

Beat. David nods, "Yes."

								  CUT TO:

INT. BASEMENT - EARLY EVENING

An enormous amount of black discs sits on the bar. David's hands are gripping the
metal.

He talks to Jeremy who stands in his position at the bottom of the stairs without
looking at him.

				 DAVID
		You should never try
		anything like this. You know
		that right?

Jeremy nods, "Yes."

				 DAVID
		What do you do if something
		happens?

				 JEREMY(soft)
		Get mom.

David nods, "yes" before starting his deep breathing. He takes one last breath.
CLINK the weights comes off the rest. His arms are trembling immediately now. His
face is locked in a grimace as he brings the bar down to his chest and back up
again two times before dropping it onto the armrest.

He slowly sits up.

				 DAVID
		How many did you put on that
		time?

				 JEREMY(soft)
		All of it.

				 DAVID
		There's no more left?

Jeremy nods, "no" in a slight daze. Beat. David looks around his basement.

				 DAVID
		What else can we use?

								  CUT TO:

INT. BASEMENT - EARLY EVENING

A set of two unopened MAB satin finish paint cans are dangling by their metal
handles on the outside of each side of the weights.

The fours cans sway a little as the bar is heaved off of David's chest. His arms
are shaking hard. He raises the weight to it's apex and brings it down again. It
touches his chest and rises up again. David's red strained face exhales
powerfully as he straightens his arms.

The bar lands on the armrest with A CRASH. The paint cans make METAL SQUEAKS as
they swing to stillness, one at a time. Beat.

David sits up and turns back to the weights. His mouth moves as he calculates the
discs and the cans.

His lips stop moving. Beat.

				 JEREMY(soft)
		How much is it?

David doesn't react.

				 JEREMY(soft)
		How much is it dad?

It takes a second for David to register the question. He looks to his son. Beat.

				 DAVID(soft)
		About three hundred and
		forty.

David turns and looks at his son. Jeremy's mouth is slightly open. He gazes at
his dad. Awe in his tiny eyes.

INT. BATHROOM - EVENING

David sits on the edge of the bathroom tub. He's just showered and wearing jeans
and a t-shirt. He sits still with his elbows resting on his knees, staring at the
white tiles of the floor.

THE PHONE RINGS.

David gets up and walks out of the bathroom. He picks up the phone and stands in
the bathroom doorway.

				 DAVID
		Yeah, hello.

				 WOMAN(on phone)
		Is David Dunne there?

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Megan?

				 MEGAN(on phone)
		Yes. Is this David?

				 DAVID
		Yeah? Megan where are you
		calling from?

				 MEGAN(on phone)
		My name is Megan Inverso. We
		went to college together.

David looks at the phone. The lights for line ONE and line TWO are glowing RED.
David squints his eyes as he pieces together the situation. Beat.

He moves back into the bathroom. The cord stretches as he takes his seat on the
edge of the bathtub.

				 DAVID
		I remember you.

				 MEGAN(on phone)
		I was hoping you would call
		me, but... Anyway I decided
		not to wait.
			(beat)
		I was thinking, it might be
		nice to go to dinner

Beat.

		Yeah it might be nice.

We hear A SOUND ON THE OTHER END OF THE PHONE. A SOUND MUCH LIKE AN EXHALE.

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - LATE EVENING

The local Chinese restaurant. Red and gold plastic dragons hang from the ceiling.
A couple late-nighters are at the bar. Megan and David are two of a handful of
people left dining in the restaurant. They're a little dressed up. Megan looks
kind of stunning.

				 DAVID
		...When you work with
		clients on machines, do they
		sometimes just jump up a
		level or two? Do something
		they didn't know they were
		capable of?

				 MEGAN
		Not often, but it is
		possible. Most people get
		scared when they see the
		shadow of their limits. They
		don't know how long the
		shadow really is. They don't
		know how far away the real
		limits are standing... They
		stop out of fear.

David nods as he takes it in. Beat. He looks down at his plate and twirls his lo
mein onto a fork. Megan watches him.

				 MEGAN
		This is kind of strange
		isn't it?

David nods, "yes" before taking the bite.

				 MEGAN
		We're not even acting like
		ourselves.

David touches his mouth with his napkin.

				 MEGAN
		Like that. Your mouth's
		dirty. You tapped your
		napkin to your lips. You
		only do that when you're
		with someone you don't know.

David looks down at his napkin.

				 DAVID
		What do I do when I'm around
		someone I know?

				 MEGAN
		You use your sleeve.

They both smile at each other. Beat.

				 WOMAN(o.s.)
		Megan?

David and Megan look over to the only other table of late night diners as they
get up from their table. A woman about Megan's age walks over to her.

				 WOMAN
		I thought it was you.

				 MEGAN
		Hi.
			 (to David)
		This is Claire. Her son is
		in Jeremy's class. Claire
		and I worked on the school
		food drive together.

				 DAVID
		Hello.

CLAIRE smiles as she stares at David. She turns to Megan.

				 CLAIRE(mouths)
		He's cute.

Claire turns back to David.

				 CLAIRE
		I'm very happy about this.
		Megan mentioned to me she
		was considering dating
		again.

Megan becomes still.

				 CLAIRE(to David)
		I'm sorry, what's your name?

Beat. David doesn't look up.

				 DAVID
		David.

				 CLAIRE
		David?

				 MEGAN
		This is my husband.

Beat. All three people become frozen in silence.

Claire looks to Megan.

				 CLAIRE(soft)
		I am so sorry.

Megan nods.

Claire quietly walks away form the table and joins her group as they leave the
restaurant. Beat.

Megan and David are the last one's left. They sit silently in their booth. Megan
looks at David's face. He's shaken.

He slowly takes a sip of water and then taps his mouth with napkin.

INT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

It's late. NO LIGHTS ARE ON EXCEPT THE ONE IN THE HALL. The babysitter has black

				 DYED HAIR GIRL
		He ate about six of those
		chocolate covered doughnut
		holes with his milk. He said
		he only had three, but I

				 DAVID
		Okay.

David is not paying attention to the girl. He watches as his wife takes off her
coat and heads to the guest room. She turns before entering the room. David and
his wife make eye contact.

				 MEGAN(soft)
		Goodnight.

David nods. Megan goes into her room. The guest door closes softly.

David finds the babysitter looking at him with an odd expression.

				 DYED HAIR GIRL
		My parents sleep in separate
		beds.

David reaches into his wallet and hands the girl money.

				 DAVID
		Thank you.

David opens the front door for her.

		By the way, Jeremy went to

		His room?

The baby sitter nods with a smile as she walks out the front door.

				 JEREMY(whispered)
		I'm not scared.

Jeremy opens his eyes.

Beat. Jeremy's eyes start to shut.

		You could have lifted more.

Jeremy Dunne falls asleep. David Dunne stands in the darkness of his son's room.
Posters of comic book heroes don the walls around him.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Elijah's cheek rests against two pristine white pillows. He looks exhausted. His
eyes are fixed on some abstract point in the room. WE HEAR SOUNDS OF A HOSPITAL.

The torso of a PHYSICIAN can be seen on the other side of the bed. We hear him
speak but never see his face.

				 PHYSICIAN(o.s.)
		...fracture of the proximal
		phalanx of the little finger
		as well as multiple

Beat.

				 PHYSICIAN(o.s.)
		Who does?

				 ELIJAH
		Kids.

Elijah just keeps staring.

				 PHYSICIAN(o.s.)
		Shall I continue?

Beat. Elijah's head nods the slightest bit up and down.

				 PHYSICIAN(o.s.)
		Pins were placed throughout

A CO-WORKER finds Megan working with an elderly gentleman who's laboring on a
stationary bike.

				 JANIS
		Your ten o'clock is here.
		The hospital discharged him

				 MEGAN
		Thanks.

The co-worker takes Megan's position by the elderly man.

Megan crosses the physical therapy center. A man in a wheel chair waits by her
office. She walks up to him with a smile.

				 MEGAN
		Elijah right?

Elijah's leg is immobilized by a metal brace and held straight. Under his shirt
we see the wrappings around his ribs. His left pinky is in a splint. He smiles

INT. STADIUM LOCKER ROOM - LATE MORNING

David Dunne stands in security uniform by a set of double doors that leads into
the players locker room.

Three walls of the locker room are lined with shiny lockers. One side of the room
has benches and massage tables. The far end of the room has work out equipment.

About twenty players and trainers are scattered throughout the spacious room lost
in their own pre-game rituals.

David watches as a massive muscular player takes a seat on the massage table and
removes his dress shirt. His body is covered in old bruises. He lays down,
wincing a bit from the pain. A trainer begins to massage him.

David just stares at the battered athlete. His gaze moves across the room. Beat.

David stares at something in the crowded room then he starts towards it.

He moves through the room of players and trainers. He moves to the one area of
the large room not occupied by anyone.

David comes to a step at the foot of an Olympic bench press. Racks and racks of
free weights sit behind the press.

David looks down at the thick silver bar. Three large black plates are on either
side. Six in all.

David looks back and glances at the double doors where he should be standing.
Beat. He looks to the twenty or so players and trainers in the room. Some of the
players have headphones on. Some are staring into space. A couple are on cell
phones...

No one notices David Dunne as he reaches for a forty-five pound black plate off
the weight rack.

The huge disc slides onto the bar with almost NO SOUND...

A matching forty-five pound disc goes on the other side...

And then David adds another. He matches it on the other side...

THE BENCH CREAKS just the slightest bit as David takes a seat.

No one notices the security guard lay back on the bench.

David's hands take hold of the shiny bar.

He closes his eyes...

David's arms become tense. He pushes against the weight. It doesn't move.

His face turns deep red. He opens his eyes and stares at the bar as he keeps
training. His face and arms are shaking... He keeps staring... focusing.

And then, without any fanfare, the bar lifts off the arm rest.

The weight hovers over David. He lowers it to his chest for a second time. His
arms aren't shaking anymore. He pushes the weights back up.

He carefully brings the bar back to the arm rest. It touches down with the
smallest of CLINKS.

David's fingers uncurl from the bar.

David lets out two slow soft breaths as he counts the thick black discs.

				 DAVID(whispers)
		Four ten... four
		forty-five...
			(beat)
		Five hundred.

Beat. David sits up in a daze.

He finds the entire room of athletes and trainers staring at him. Some of the
players have stood up. Everyone stares as David Dunne with the same quiet
disbelief in their eyes.

Megan is taken off guard by the question. She stares at Elijah. Beat.

				 MEGAN
		Twelve years.

				 ELIJAH
		How did you get together?

Elijah smiles warmly. Megan smiles softly back.

				 MEGAN
		A car accident.

Elijah smiles even bigger.

				 ELIJAH
		Now you're going to have to
		tell me more.

				 MEGAN
		...See my husband was a big
		football star in college and
		we were in an accident
		together. Our car flipped on
		an icy road. We were both
		injured. He couldn't play
		football anymore.
			(beat)
		If that hadn't happened, we
		wouldn't have been together.

				 ELIJAH
		How so?

				 MEGAN
		Football wasn't the kind of
		life I wanted... For ten
		years I'd be by the phone
		waiting for a call telling
		me he broke his neck in a
		practice game. And if it
		wasn't that call, it would
		be a call telling me he blew
		out his knee or suffered his
		third concussion. I've seen
		way too much of it in my
		job... I can barely take it
		when my clients are in pain.
			(beat)
		I don't hate the game. I
		admire the amount of skill
		it involved and, like
		everyone else, I was in awe
		of how he could play it, but
		I couldn't give him my heart
		and then have something
		happen to him. And it always
		does with that game.
			(beat)
		It's not a thing many people
		would understand.

				 ELIJAH
		You and my mother would have

		Any way, fate stepped in and

Beat.

				 MEGAN
		Sort of.

Eleven football players in white and green battle eleven football players in blue

David stands at the lip of a tunnel that opens out onto the upper section of the
second level. Waves of people move from their seats through the tunnel to the
bathrooms and concession stands and back again.

David stares to the side away from the movement, his shoulder leaned up against
the wall. He looks over at the constant movement of spectators through the
tunnel.

Beat. His shoulder leaves the wall. He STEPS OUT into the stream of people.
Shoulders and arms bump into him and brush by him as they move.

David's eyes are looking down - his expression still - like he's listening.

He continues into the dead center of the tunnel. He's in the heaviest part of the
movement now. Fans continue to brush against him as they pass.

And then it happens... A stocky woman bumps into him.

David seems lost in his thoughts. He looks up at the nurse.

				 DAVID
		Yes I am.

EXT. BUS STOP - AFTERNOON

David and Jeremy are seated on a bench at a Septa bus stop. No one else is
waiting with them.

Jeremy talks without making eye contact with his dad.

				 JEREMY(soft)
		It was Potter and another
		guy I play football with.
		They were messing with this
		Chinese girl. She's kind of
		fat. She doesn't talk to
		anybody.
			(beat)
		I tried to make them stop.
		They kept pushing me down
		and wouldn't let me get up.

Beat. Jeremy's VOICE STARTS TO TREMBLE SOFTLY.

				 JEREMY(soft)
		I thought maybe cause you
		were my dad, I thought I
		might be like you.

Jeremy finally looks up. Tears in his eyes.

				 JEREMY(soft)
		I'm not like you.

David moves closer to Jeremy on the bench.

				 DAVID
		You are like me. We both can
		get hurt. I'm just an
		ordinary man.
			(beat)
		I'm not what you think I am.

Jeremy just stares at his father. Beat.

				 JEREMY
		Why do you keep saying that?

								  CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN - EVENING

David stares at his bowl of pasta. He sits alone in the kitchen. Beat.

He gets up, slides the pasta in the trash and moves to the sink.

David is rinsing out the bowl when Megan walks in. David turns off the water.

				 MEGAN
		He's just laying in bed.
		He's pretty upset. He won't
		talk.

				 DAVID
		He's dealing with a lot of
		things.
			(beat)
		I think he needs to find
		answers himself.

Beat.

				 MEGAN
		It's weird to hear you tell
		me about Jeremy.
			(beat)
		A good weird.

David looks at Megan. They stand silently in an awkward pause. Beat.

				 DAVID
		Would you like to try going-

				 MEGAN
		Yes.

				 DAVID
		-out again.

Beat. David smiles.

				 DAVID
		But if we see another mother
		from Jeremy's school, me
		name is Juan. I always
		wanted to be a Juan.

Megan smiles softly back. Beat.

				 MEGAN
		Oh. Elijah Price came to
		visit me at the center
		today.

				 DAVID
		Jesus.

Megan sees David's shocked expression.

				 MEGAN
		He didn't do anything. He
		just told me his theory...
		It's sad when patients get
		like that. They loose
		reality.

				 DAVID(whisper)
		Jeremy what the hell are you
		doing?

Megan suddenly realizes David is looking over her shoulder.

Megan turns around. She SCREAMS.

Jeremy is standing in the doorway to the kitchen. He's crying hard. In his
outstretched hands is the HAND GUN FROM DAVID'S CLOSET. It's pointed directly at
David.

				 JEREMY(crying)
		You don't believe. I'll show
		you... You can't get hurt.

				 MEGAN(realizing)
		-Oh my God.

				 DAVID
		-Jeremy did you load that
		gun?

Jeremy nods, "Yes." Crying harder now.

				 JEREMY(crying)
		-You won't get hurt...

				 DAVID
		-Elijah was wrong.

				 MEGAN
		-Sometimes when people are
		sick or hurt for a long
		time, like Elijah, they're
		mind gets hurt too.

David shoots a tense glance at Megan.

				 MEGAN
		-They start to think things
		that aren't true. He hold me
		what he thought about your
		father. It isn't true.

				 JEREMY(crying)
		-I'll show you.

David starts moving a little to his right. Jeremy follows him with the barrel of
the handgun. David stops moving.

				 DAVID
		-You know the story about
		the kid who almost drowned
		in the pool?

Jeremy stops moving.

				 DAVID
		-That was me they were
		talking about. I almost
		died. That was me.

				 JEREMY(crying)
		-You're lying.

				 DAVID
		-I'm not. I just didn't
		connect it.

				 MEGAN
		-Jeremy, your father was
		injured in college - you
		know that. You know all
		about that.

Jeremy's small face tenses. Confusion mixes with the desperation on his face.

				 MEGAN
		-Don't do it. He'll die
		Jeremy.

Beat. Jeremy looks up, tears streaming down his cheeks.

				 JEREMY(crying)
		-I'll just shoot him once.

				 DAVID
		-Jeremy listen to what-

Jeremy starts pressing the trigger. The hammer clicks back.

				 JEREMY
		-Don't be scared.

				 DAVID
		-Jeremy if you pull that
		trigger I'm going to leave!
		I'm going to go to New York.

Jeremy freezes. David flashes a desperate glance at Megan then back to Jeremy.

				 DAVID
		You're right... If you shoot
		me, that bullet is going to
		bounce off me and I won't
		get hurt... but then I'm
		going to go upstairs and
		pack. And then leave to New
		York.

Beat.

				 JEREMY(crying)
		-Why?

Jeremy's hands are trembling. He starts to close his eyes as he raises the gun
level with David's chest.

				 DAVID(loud)
		Jeremy!

Jeremy's eyes open.

				 DAVID(loud)
		You're about to get into big
		trouble! I'm your father and
		I'm telling you to put that
		gun down right now God damn
		it!
			(beat)
		One!...
			(beat)
		Two!...

Jeremy puts the gun down on the floor in front of him and stands up.

Megan leans against the refrigerator and slides down to a sitting position on the
tiled floor.

David walks over and picks up the gun. He unloads the bullets in his hand. David
bends down very slowly and takes a seat on the kitchen floor.

Jeremy is the last to sit down. He takes a seat in the doorway of the kitchen.
Beat. He wipes his eyes with the back of his hand. Beat.

				 JEREMY(soft)
		...You didn't have to yell.

The Dunne family sits in silence on the floor of their kitchen.

EXT. LIMITED EDITION - AFTERNOON

People move up and down the streets outside the storefronts. David is one of
them. He waits to cross the street. He sees movement inside the Limited Edition
window.

INT. LIMITED EDITION - AFTERNOON

Elijah opens the door. It takes him a bit, because of the wheelchair.

David stares at Elijah's damaged condition. Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		Joined a rugby league.
		Turned out to be a bad idea.
			(beat)
		Come here I want to show you
		something.

Elijah wheels over to one of the framed sketches on the wall. It's a charcoal
drawing of a muscular figure shielding himself from a blow about to be delivered.
A huge ominous shadow is covering him, as if something unspeakable and evil is
just out of frame.

				 ELIJAH
		Look at this. I just noticed
		this today.

David steps in close and studies the drawing.

				 ELIJAH
		This is from the Sentryman
		series. A color version of
		this was actually used in
		the second issue.

Elijah points up to the drawing's face.

				 ELIJAH
		Look at this eyes. What do
		you see?

David looks right at the intense eyes of the drawing.

				 ELIJAH
		It's fear.
			(beat)
		He was scared. They were
		being honest in the
		beginning you see. They let
		him be human.
			(beat)
		They turned him into a
		garden variety hero later...
		Then he was brave all the
		time.

Elijah turns to David.

				 ELIJAH
		I followed the guy in the
		army jacket.

David becomes still as his words register.

				 ELIJAH
		He had a silver handled gun
		tucked in the back of his
		pants.
			(beat)
		Were you really injured in
		that car accident in
		college?

David looks unsteady all of the sudden.

				 ELIJAH
		Because I think you faked
		it. I think you took the
		opportunity to end your
		career - no questions asked.
			(beat)
		And I think you did it, of
		all things, for a women...
			(beat)
		Not only do you have the
		physical traits of a hero,
		down somewhere in there, you
		have the moral code of one
		too. You were ready to
		sacrifice everything for
		what's right. Where can you
		find that these days?
			(beat)
		Only thing you didn't realize
		is that you were giving up
		a part of yourself when you
		gave up football. The
		physical part. And you need
		that part desperately to
		feel balance again...
			(beat)
		You can have it back now.
			(beat)
		This was all just make
		believe before. What if
		there was someone the
		opposite of me? What if?...
			(beat)
		I now believe you are the
		genuine article Mr. David
		Dunne. The kind of person we
		knew existed, from our
		history.

Elijah points to the room full of pictures.

				 ELIJAH
		It's time for someone like
		you.
			(beat)
		Bad is winning. I can feel
		it.

Elijah looks at David with deep admiration. His voice cracked a little at the end
of his words. Beat.

David doesn't take his hands out of his pockets.

				 DAVID(rattled)
		I must have felt some lump
		in his back when I bumped
		him. Most guns have a black
		or silver handle. I had a
		fifty-fifty shot at the
		color.

				 ELIJAH
		That's not what I witnessed
		David.

				 DAVID
		Stop messing with my life
		Elijah. My son almost shot
		me last night. He wanted to
		prove you were right.

				 ELIJAH
		I never said you couldn't be
		killed. I never said that.

				 DAVID
		You have a problem, Elijah.
		My wife is right. Somewhere
		along the line one of your
		bones broke and your mind
		just broke with it.

Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		Are you finished?

				 DAVID
		No. And I have been sick. I
		spent a week in a hospital
		when I was a boy recovering
		from pneumonia and almost
		drowning.

				 DAVID
		Two skinny eight year old
		kids were playing around the
		pool. They were dunking me.
		I swallowed water. They
		didn't know it and they
		almost killed me.
			(beat)
		Heroes don't get killed like
		that. Normal people do.

Beat. Elijah seems shaken for the first time. David stares at him coldly.

				 DAVID
		I don't want to see you
		again okay.
			(soft)
		Now I'm finished.

David turns and starts for the entrance. The BELL OF THE DOOR CLANGS as David
Dunne leaves the store.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON

David exits the Limited Edition and moves down the street lost in this thoughts.
He bumps a man in a jacket and tie walking in the opposite direction.

FLASH CUT: THE SAME MAN STANDS IN A BAGGY SWEATER. AGAINST A PARKED CAR HE'S
HOLDING SOMETHING SHINY AND METALLIC IN HIS HANDS. HE INSERTS IT IN THE HALF INCH
GAP BETWEEN THE GLASS OF THE DRIVER'S WINDOW AND THE DOOR. THE DOOR UNLOCKS.

THE MAN LOOKS AROUND QUIETLY BEFORE ENTERING THE CAR.

SLAM CUT BACK TO THE PRESENT:

David looks over his shoulder at the conservative looking man in a shirt and tie
walking down the street.

David Dunne is shaken. He turns and keeps walking.

								  CUT TO:

INT. JEREMY'S ROOM - NIGHT

A superhero action figure and a plastic villain do battle on Jeremy's desk.

David sits dressed up in a white shirt and dress pants. He holds the villain.
Jeremy holds the superhero.

Megan enters the room in a beautiful brown dress.

				 MEGAN
		The sitter's here.

David nods, "yes." Megan studies his tense expression.

				 MEGAN
		We can do this another time
		if you want? I'm fine with
		anything.

David looks from the action figures, to his son's face to the face of his wife.
They both have the same quiet anxious expression. Beat.

				 DAVID
		But I put cologne on.

Megan smiles.

				 MEGAN
		Is that what that smell is?

Jeremy giggles.

								  CUT TO:

INT. DOWNTOWN COMIC BOOK STORE - NIGHT

An overweight man in sweats and a ponytail counts the cash in the register. We
are in a low-end comic book store. The walls are lined with shelves of comic
books. The more expensive issues are kept in a glass case.

THE PONYTAIL MAN looks at his watch and then to far back of the store where one
head is visible behind a low rack.

				 PONYTAIL MAN
		Hey man it's twenty after.
		It's time to close. I gotta
		head.

The top of the man's head doesn't move. Beat.

				 PONYTAIL MAN
		You better not be jacking
		off to the Japanese comics.
		I swear to God.

No response. Ponytail man closes his register and walks towards the back.

As he gets closer to the customer, he realizes that the man is in a wheelchair.
The Ponytail man walks ups to Elijah.

				 PONYTAIL MAN
		Listen man, I didn't know
		you were in-
			(beat)
		Just choose something all
		right?

Elijah doesn't react. He sits in his chair in a quiet daze. Ponytail man leans
over.

				 PONYTAIL MAN
		Hello. You understand
		English?

Ponytail man makes fake sign language gestures in front of Elijah's face.

				 PONYTAIL MAN
		Look man, I'm just gonna
		wheel you out. You can think
		about things outside on the
		sidewalk. I gotta get some
		chicken in me, you know what
		I'm saying?

Beat. The Ponytail man shakes his head moves behind Elijah. He starts wheeling
him towards the front of the store. They move down a narrow aisle of comics.

Elijah suddenly grabs the left wheel and turns the chair. His immobilized left
leg hits a rack of comic books. A handful of comics tumbles to the ground.

				 PONYTAIL MAN
		Shit.

The ponytail man straightens the wheelchair and starts down the aisle again.
After a couple of feet, Elijah jerks and grabs the other wheel sending the
wheelchair ramming violently into the opposite wall. Comics are knocked free and
fall onto the wheel chair and the nearby ground.

				 PONYTAIL MAN
		Dude, I don't care if you
		are in a wheelchair. If you
		do that again, I'm calling
		Five-O.

Beat. The Ponytail man takes Elijah's silence as a, "Yes." He straightens the
chair.

They move down the aisle. All is quiet... and then Elijah jerks the wheelchair to
the left again. His metal brace and the wheelchair crash into two racks. Elijah
gets covered in comics.

				 PONYTAIL MAN
		That's it crackerjack!
		You're going to sit your ass
		in jail now.

The Ponytail man moves to the front counter.

Elijah sits in a trance - slightly hunched over. His eyes stare at a comic book
in his lap. His expression changes for the first time.

The Ponytail man finishes dialing. He looks over to Elijah as he waits for a
voice on the other end. Elijah raises a single comic book in his hand.

				 ELIJAH
		How much is this one?

								  CUT TO:

INT. RESTAURANT BAR - NIGHT

LATE EVENING. A trendy restaurant. Not enough light to read the menus.

David and Megan are on stools at one end of the bat. They sip their drinks as
they appear in deep thought.

				 DAVID
		...I think rust.

				 MEGAN
		Rust?

				 DAVID
		As a color, not as rust. You
		know, a rust colored paint
		or wood?

Megan leans slightly closer.

				 MEGAN
		I didn't know that. Mine's
		still brown.

				 DAVID
		My turn. What's your
		favorite song?

				 MEGAN
		Soft and Wet, by the Artist
		Formerly Known as Prince.

				 DAVID
		What was that?

				 MEGAN
		We're supposed to be honest.

Beat. David brings his stool closer.

				 DAVID
		Soft and Wet. That's very
		interesting.

				 MEGAN
		My turn.
			(beat)
		When was the first time the
		thought popped into your
		head that we might not make
		it?

David's grin slowly fades.

				 DAVID
		That's not the game.

Megan moves her stool closer. They're only a foot or so apart.

				 MEGAN
		It's a second date. There
		aren't any rules.

Beat. David sips his drink slowly.

				 DAVID
		I'm not sure.

				 MEGAN
		Think carefully?

				 DAVID
		What about the game?

				 MEGAN
		It's finished. I won.

Beat. David glances at Megan. She waits for his answer.

				 MEGAN
		Maybe it wasn't a specific
		moment, maybe it-

				 DAVID
		I had a nightmare one night
		and I didn't wake you up so
		you could tell me it was
		okay.
			(beat)
		I think that was the first
		time.
			(beat)
		Does that count?

				 MEGAN(soft)
		That counts.

Beat. Megan takes her glass up to her lips. Doesn't take a sip. Brings it back
down.

				 MEGAN
		Do you knowingly keep Jeremy
		and me at a distance?

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Yes.

Megan's face tenses. She's on the verge of getting upset.

				 MEGAN
		Why?

				 DAVID
		I don't know Megan.

				 MEGAN
		It's like you resent us
		David. Resent the life you
		have.

Beat. David doesn't answer.

				 MEGAN
		You know even if it meant we
		couldn't be together, I
		would never have wished that
		injury on you? What you
		could so physically was a
		gift. I would never have
		wished it to go away.

Megan's eyes glaze with water. Beat.

				 MEGAN
		You know that right?

David takes a sip with a trembling hand. David's eyes look up and make eye
contact with Megan's. He stares at her for the longest time.

				 DAVID(soft)
		I know.

Husband and wife sit close together in the corner of the bar on their second
date.

								  CUT TO:

INT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

Megan stands next to David as he pulls out his wallet. The babysitter with the
black dyed hair and Buddy Holly glasses stands ready to leave in the doorway.

				 DYED HAIR GIRL
		You got two calls. One came
		through while I was on the
		line - I wasn't talking too
		long. There was an emergency
		with my sister. She tried to
		do her own perm and now she
		looks like-

				 DAVID
		Who called through?

Megan tries to hide her smile.

				 DYED HAIR GIRL
		Someone from New York.

The smile instantly fades.

				 DYED HAIR GIRL
		About a security job at a
		museum. They want to hire
		you.
			(beat)
		I didn't know you guys were
		moving to New York. Thanks
		for telling me.

				 MEGAN
		We're not moving.

				 DYED HAIR GIRL
		Oh.
			(beat)
		I let the answering machine
		pick up the other call.

The babysitter fixes her Buddy Holly glasses as she looks at the two suddenly
quiet faces.

David hands her the money. She opens the door. It's started to rain.

				 DYED HAIR GIRL
		Great.

The babysitter covers her head with her jacket and runs down the walkway. David
closes the door. Beat.

				 MEGAN
		Look let's be honest here.
		We're just at the beginning.
		I don't expect you or I to
		change the course of where
		our lives were headed
		because of two dates.
			(beat)
		If you do go to New York, we
		can still develop this.
		We'll just be forced to take
		it slow. And in the end,
		that's definitely better.
			(beat)
		This is our second time
		around David. I don't expect
		us to get carried away.
			(beat)
		I guess congratulations is
		the right thing to say.

Megan takes off her coat as she moves to the guest bedroom. She disappears
inside. The door closely behind her.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Only the COUNTER LIGHT is on in the kitchen. David stands by the phone.

ELIJAH'S VOICE IS HEARD ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE.

				 ELIJAH(on tape)
		...David. It's Elijah. It
		was so obvious. It's
		referred to over and over.
		That's the key you see. The
		repetition across time. That
		means at some point it was
		all based on common thought,
		a common event - a fact.
			(beat)
		It was this one issue that
		brought it back for me...
		Century Comics
		One-Seventeen. That's where
		this group, the Coalition of
		Evil, tried to ascertain the
		weakness of every superhero.

				 ELIJAH(on tape)
		...Because they all have
		one.
			(beat)
		Just like you.
			(beat)
		The cells that make up your
		muscles and your bones react
		to forces that act upon it,
		slightly different from than
		mine. That's clear... Your
		cells react to bacteria and
		viruses slightly differently
		than mine... That's also
		clear...But for some reason,
		you and I react the exact
		same way to water. We
		swallow it, we choke. We
		swallow too much of it, we
		drown. However unreal it may
		seem, we are connected, you
		and I, we are on the same
		curve... just on opposite
		ends.

				 ELIJAH
		The point of all this is, we
		now know something we
		didn't... You have a
		weakness... Water. It's your
		krpytonite.
			(beat)
		You hearing me David? Call
		me back... I got rugby
		practice in an hour.

THE SOUND OF ELIJAH HANGING UP IS HEARD. THE ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS AS IT TURNS

David hits a button on the answering machine. It makes a WHIRRING SOUND before
ANNOUNCING.

				 MACHINE
		Message erased.

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

The master bedroom is very narrow. A bathtub and toilet are at one end. Two
identical sinks sit opposite each other.

David sits on the edge of the tub. His shirt is unbuttoned. He sits in a daze
staring at the tiled floor.

His eyes slowly move to a small white and red box laying on its side under one of
the sinks.

David rises and picks it up.

It's a BOX OF BAND AIDS. David looks up to Megan's sink. Perfume and lotions sit
on its edge.

David opens her mirrored cabinet. He starts to put the band aid box back, he
hesitates.

His eyes begin to roam the cabinet shelves. They stop on certain items... A
CONTAINER OF TYLENOL... A LOTION FOR DRY SKIN... A BOTTLE OF ALLERGY DROPS...
COUGH SYRUP...  A TUBE OF MUSCLE PAIN OINTMENT...

David just stands quietly for a beat before turning and looking across to his own
identical mirrored medicine cabinet.

There are three things on the shelf... DISPOSABLE RAZORS. SHAVING CREAM. AND
COLOGNE.

David's mouth opens just a little bit as he stares.

								  CUT TO:

INT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT

ALL THE LIGHTS ARE OUT.

David moves through the darkness down the stares in jeans and a sweatshirt.

He moves to the coat closet. Pulls out the dark green rain poncho. The word
"security" is almost faded away.

He opens and closes the front door with virtually NO SOUND.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. THIRTIETH STREET STATION - NIGHT

Rain falls like gunfire from the sky.

David's car pulls into the massive rain station parking lot.

David steps out and pulls the hood of the poncho over his head.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. METAL STAIRS - NIGHT

A steel fence leads to a set of stairs that travel down to the dozens of
interconnected tracks below. David walks down about forty feet. A fenced gate
with a lock stops his progress.

David looks through the fence down to the tracks. Just to the side is a
construction site. Cranes and lifts and various equipment stand idle in the area
next to the section of train wreckage that has been brought to the station
grounds for dismantling and salvaging. The bent shapes of the train pieces can
only be glimpsed in outlines as they sit in the darkness, hundreds of feet away
from the immaculately lit train station.

Beat. A HUGE METALLIC CRACK ECHOES THROUGH THE TRAIN YARD as David kicks open the
fence door that holds him back from going down.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. TRAIN WRECKAGE - NIGHT

Frightening twisted pieces of metal glisten in the rain. David walks along the
body of the caved-in passenger car.

The passenger car is split in two. Just before the tear, along the window line,
the windows have been crushed in. A huge hole has been ripped below the windows
exposing the ravaged interior.

David stands before this heavily damaged area of the car. He just stares at the
wreckage. Water falls off the rim of his hood in front of his face.

His eyes drift over the ominous pieces of deformed metal. He takes a couple slow
breaths as THE SOUNDS OF HARSH RAIN FADE AWAY TO SILENCE.

								  CUT TO:

FLASHBACK: EXT. STREET - NIGHT

SILENCE. BLACK. OUR VISION CLEARS TO REVEAL the glazed icy top of a street.

THE SOUND OF DISTANT FIRE COMES INTO THE SILENCE.

A TWENTY YEAR OLD DAVID DUNNE rises to his feet from the ground where he was
laying amongst the fragmented pieces of windshield. He looks down at himself. His
football jacket is torn. So are his jeans... He's trembling slightly, but not
bleeding.

HE LOOKS UP TOWARDS THE NOISES.

About thirty feet away is a Honda, upside down, wrapped around a telephone pole.
It's front is on fire.

Through one of the crushed door windows, WE SEE A WOMAN'S HAND.

Young David heads toward his car. He slips a couple of times on the slick iced
surface of the road.

He kneels down next to the inverted car. He looks in the crushed window frame.

THE FACE OF A TWENTY YEAR OLD MEGAN IS UPSIDE DOWN. She is unconscious.

				 DAVID
		Megan...

She doesn't answer. Her body is twitching as it sits pinned behind the wheel.

David pulls at the handle of the mangled door. It's wedged tight. It won't move.

The heat from the fire is tremendous.

David's powerful arms keep pulling with all their strength.

WE HEAR THE CREAK OF METAL... THE DOOR BENDS UNNATURALLY AND THEN PRACTICALLY
RIPS OPEN.

David leans into the car and unbuckles Megan. He works her out underneath the
steering column. He slides out. Her leg is bleeding.

David picks her up and carries her to the grass next to the road. He lays her
down gently.

				 DAVID
		Megan?

He just stares at her. She doesn't respond.

A LIGHT WASHES OVER THEM. David turns to see a truck approaching up the road.
David waves frantically. The truck slows.

David turns back to Megan. Her eyes are open.

Tears fall from David's face as he moves the hair out of her eyes. She looks at
David.

				 MEGAN(soft)
		I thought I was dead.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Me too.

The driver of the truck slips and slides his way over to David.

				 DRIVER
		Is she all right?

				 DAVID
		I think her leg is
		fractured.

				 DRIVER
		Are you injured?

Beat. David looks at Megan who lays shivering in the grass. He looks back at the
driver.

				 DAVID(soft)
		My shoulder's hurt.

The driver nods.

				 DRIVER
		Hold on. I got a C.B. in the
		truck.

The driver moves back to his truck.

David takes Megan's hand in his and waits in the grass by the sight of their car
on fire.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

The wheels of Elijah's wheelchair move down the hall as he follows the SOUND OF
THE PHONE RINGING.

He follows THE SOUND to a PHONE RINGING in the storage room of the store. There
are shelves and shelves of comic books. Thousands of them filed away in neat
piles.

Elijah picks up the phone a little out of breath.

				 ELIJAH
		Hello.

				 DAVID'S VOICE
		Elijah?

Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		David?

Nothing is said on the other line for a couple of beats. WE HEAR THE ECHOED DIN
OF A LARGE ROOM FILLED WITH PEOPLE AND MOVEMENT IN THE BACKGROUND.

				 DAVID'S VOICE
		What am I supposed to do?

Elijah closes his eyes. His face fills with strength.

								  CUT TO:

INT. THIRTIETH STREET STATION PHILADELPHIA - NIGHT

The interior of the station is a mystical sight. One huge cavernous room, a
football field in size, lined on both sides with giant pillars that rise into a
misty hand painted ceiling.

				 ELIJAH(v.o.)
		David, it's okay to be
		afraid. Because this part
		won't be like a comic
		book... Real life doesn't
		fit into little boxes that
		were drawn for it.

David stands in a quiet corner and watches the faces of passengers arriving and
departing late night trains. Even at the late hour, there is heavy traffic
throughout the station.

				 ELIJAH(v.o.)
		Go to where people are...
		You won't have to look very
		long.

David stares out at the midnight travelers. Beat. He starts towards them.

He passed the towering black statue standing at the far end of the station. It
watches over the whole building. It's in the form of an angel lifting a soldier
to heaven.

David moves through the first group of people - a crisscross of arriving
passengers from tracks one and two. They brush by him and lightly bump him as
they move.

FLASH CUT: WE ARE NO LONGER IN THE TRAIN STATION. A BLOND WOMAN IN HER TWENTIES
STANDS AT A COUNTER IN A CROWDED STORE.

SHE SLIDES THE SILVER BRACELET AND EARRINGS SHE WAS LOOKING AT OFF THE GLASS
COUNTER AND INTO HER PURSE. NO ONE SEES.

SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

David turns and glances at the blonde woman as she walks away from him towards
the exit of the train station. He doesn't stop moving.

David heads towards the densest part of the floor. The area near the information
board. Sleepy friends and tired family members stand and wait. A steady
spider-like web of movement flows as six  tracks let out on either side.

David moves to the center. His rain poncho almost touches the marble floor. Lines
of passengers emerging from trains below the main level move steadily on either
side of him.

David looks down and gently turns the palms of his hands out as they at his side.
His finger tops graze the jackets and clothes of the passengers walking by.

Dozens and dozens of people pass. Nothing happens. Then a man in a crumpled shirt
and slicked back hair brushes by...

FLASH CUT: THE SLICKED BLACKED HAIRED MAN LEANS OUT THE WINDOW OF A TRUCK. HE'S
HOLDING A BOTTLE OF BEER.

				 SLICKED HAIR MAN
		Go back to Africa!

THE SLICKED HAIR MAN THROWS THE BOTTLE WITH FORCE AS HE PASSES A CLACK FAMILY
WALKING ON THE SIDEWALK. THE BOTTLE SHATTERS AS IT HITS A WOMAN IN THE GROUP.

SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

David's eyes dart up as the slicked haired man turns the corner at the
information booth. He watches him for a beat.

FLASH CUT: WE ARE IN A BEDROOM. A YOUNG MAN IN HIS LATE TEENS LOOKS DOWN AT A
GIRL LAYING IN A PILE OF OVERCOATS ON A BED. THERE IS LOUD MUSIC AND LAUGHTER
COMING FROM SOMEWHERE DOWNSTAIRS.

				 TEENAGER
		What's your name? I think
		you drank too much.

THE GIRL MOANS SOMETHING INAUDIBLE AS SHE ROLLS ON HER SIDE. HER SKIRT RIDES UP
HER THIGH.

THE YOUNG MAN STARES AT HER AND THEN GETS UP. HE MAKES SURE NO ONE IS LOOKING
BEFORE CLOSING THE DOOR. HE LOCKS IT FROM THE INSIDE.

SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

David watches the teenager with baggy jeans hanging off his hip. He walks and
greets a group of identically dressed friends.

Beat. David turns his hands back in. He seems shaken. He takes a couple of deep
breaths as he gathers himself.

Then David steps back to look around. HE BUMPS the shoulder of a man standing
behind him.

David takes a sudden breath like someone punched him in the solar plexus.

FLASH CUT: AN ENORMOUS MAN WITH GLASSY EYES STANDS BEFORE A SCREEN SIDE DOOR.
HE'S BALDING. THE HAIR HE DOES HAVE IS SHOULDER LENGTH. HIS ECLIPSING SHADOW
FALLS ON THE CONSERVATIVE LOOKING MAN WHO STANDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN
DOOR INSIDE THE HOUSE.

				 GLASSY EYED MAN
		Can I come in?

				 MAN IN HOUSE
		Who are you?

				 GLASSY EYED MAN
		I like your house. Can I
		come in?

				 MAN IN HOUSE
		What is this?
			(beat)
		No you can't come in.

Beat.

				 GLASSY EYED MAN
		Are you sure?

The enormous glassy eyed man takes hold of the screen door handle. He turns it.
The man inside the house grabs the door handle on the inside to stop him.

				 MAN IN HOUSE
		What are you doing?

The man inside the house uses all his strength to keep the door from opening...
It opens slowly anyway.

SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

David stands frozen in the train station. His face is almost unreadable.

David is standing less than a foot away from the man he bumped. They're standing
shoulder to shoulder. David's eyes slowly move from the ground over his right and
then finally onto the man.

He's huge. At least three inches taller than David. His shoulders are massive.
He's wearing a one piece ORANGE UNIFORM.

The man in the orange uniform leans over a trashcan next to him and removes the
full trash bag within it. He replaces it with a fresh one. He throws the full
trash bag into a gray plastic bin with wheels and starts pushing it.

David watches the man head across the floor towards a double door marked "Station
Maintenance Staff Only".

Four identical gray bins sit outside the door. The huge man disappears with his
bin inside.

David waits. He just stares hard at the double doors. Nothing happens for the
longest time... No one comes out. David makes a decision. He starts towards the
doors.

And then they open.

The huge glassy eyed man in orange emerges carrying a bag over his shoulder. He's
wearing a baseball hat with his uniform now. He heads toward a back exit.

David lets him get about twenty feet away before deciding to follow him.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

The man in the orange uniform walks in the driving rain down a residential city
block. Almost all the lights in the middle class homes he's passing are off at
this late hour. No one is out walking except him and David Dunne fifty feet
behind.

The orange figure turns the corner onto a block of modest stand alone homes. The
uniformed man walks slower in this block. He looks around carefully as he moves.

He turns into a driveway of one of the homes. He stops and pulls a wad of mail
out of the mailbox.

David stands with the hood of his security coat covering his head and face. He
stands in the shadows and watches silently as the man in the orange uniform looks
over his massive shoulder before turning a knob and entering the white paneled
house through a familiar side door with a screen on it.

								  CUT TO:

INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT

The side door opens with almost no sound. The hooded figure of David Dunne steps
into a narrow laundry room. THE SOUND OF A TELEVISION IS HEARD FROM ANOTHER ROOM.

A very large pile of unopened mail sits in a mound on the clothes dryer. Two or
three days worth.

David shuts the door very slowly.

								  CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

THE SOUNDS OF CHEERING FROM THE TELEVISION IN THE NEXT ROOM SPILL INTO THE
KITCHEN.

David stares out from under his hood at the mess.

Cabinets are left open. Empty cans of food sit on the counter with a handful of
unwashed dishes. The breakfast table is the eeriest thing in the room. It sits
frozen with a plate of half-eaten, now moldy eggs at one setting and two bowls of
colorful cereal in another. The cereal has dissolved in the old milk. Two
cockroaches are crawling in the bowl.

David moves slowly to a door in the kitchen. It's slightly open. As David gets
closer, he shields his face from the strong smell. He pulls the door open
quietly.

A SHAFT OF KITCHEN LIGHTS FALLS DOWN THE STAIRS INTO THE BASEMENT. At the bottom
of the stairs is a MAN'S BODY. The same man who answered the door in the
flashback lays partly in the shadow, partly in the light. His crumpled tie lies
folded over itself on his still chest.

								  CUT TO:

INT. FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

A BOXING MATCH BLARES ON THE TELEVISION. Empty beer bottles and coke cans sit in
a pyramid on the coffee table.

David steps into the unoccupied room. His movements are slow and tense.

THUDS OF HEAVY FOOTSTEPS COME FROM THE CEILING OF THE ROOM. David looks up and
follows the SOUND AS IT MOVES AROUND ABOVE HIM.

David moves to the stairs as SOMEONE GETS KNOCKED OUT ON THE TELEVISION.

								  CUT TO:

INT. GIRL'S ROOM - NIGHT

Three closed doors converge on a landing. David opens the closest one.

It's a young girl's room. Posters of boy bands are on her wall. Clothes are
everywhere. The room is empty.

A NOISE COMES FROM THE HALF OPEN BATHROOM DOOR ATTACHED TO THE BEDROOM.

								  CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

A slightly overweight girl, probably fourteen years old is tied by her wrists
with a phone cord to the metal towel rack in her bathroom. She sits with her arms
pointed upward over her head. He knees tucked up to her chest.

Next to her is her younger brother. A skinny boy, maybe twelve. He's tied and
seated in the same way.

Their heads are leaned back against their arms. They're completely listless. Eyes
half mast. They watch as the door to the bathroom opens and the dark hooded
figure of David Dunne steps in. His long dark slowing rain poncho still dripping
water. He stands in the doorway for a moment before moving towards them.

They don't react in anyway as David reaches for the phone cord and unties them.
They're arms flop to their laps as they gaze up at the figure leaning over them.
They boy blinks once slowly.

David takes a step back and stares at them from under his hood.

				 DAVID
		You need to leave now.

								  CUT TO:

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

An exercise bike in the corner of the bedroom has been turned into a clothes
hanger long ago. The t.v. across the bed has framed family photos displayed on
top of it.

David's shadow passes over them as he moves towards the open bathroom on the
other side of the bedroom.

A woman is tied to the bathroom door handle. She sits on the tiled floor slumped
against the door. Her eyes stare blankly at the ground. She has considerable
bruises on her face and arms.

David stands before her.

				 DAVID(soft)
		Where is he?

The woman doesn't answer, but a SOUND COMES FROM THE SCREEN DOOR nearby. The
curtains draping the screen door move with the wind from outside.

David crosses the room and pushes aside the curtain. It leads to a small balcony.
An empty lawn chair is the only thing on it.

David steps onto the balcony and looks down.

The rain still pours down unmercifully. It comes down on a black tarp that covers
a pool in the backyard.

David turns to go back inside.

A BLURR OF ORANGE ATTACKS HIM.

The collision is sudden and explosive. The huge man drives his shoulder into
David's chest and takes him off his feet. David's body flips over the railing.

The dark green rain poncho flaps in the wind as he falls two stories directly
towards the black tarp.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. POOL - NIGHT

David lands on his stomach with a TREMENDOUS SLAP onto the nylon black tarp.

There's a thin layer of rain water on the tarp's surface. David is laying on his
cheek. Half his face is covered in water.

Beat. David's exposed eye looks around in a daze. The surface of  the tarp gets
pounded by the rain.

David uses his hands to push his body off the tarp. His hands sink into the water
as his pressure pushes the tarp down.

THE FIRST SOUNDS OF NYLON SLIDING AGAINST CONCRETE START.

David stops pushing. His vision catches the corner of the swimming pool as the
tarp slides out from under the sand bags that hold it in place.

The tarp sags. David becomes utterly still. THE SOUND CONTINUES ANYWAY.

One by one the tarp starts sliding out from under the sand bags all around the
edge of the pool.

And then without warning, the tarp caves in. It folds around David as he and the
tarp get pulled UNDER THE COLD DARK WATER.

								  CUT TO:

EXT.  UNDER WATER - NIGHT

David's body is tangled in the pool cover. His legs and arms thrash against the
constricting black tarp. He's drowning.

GLIMPSES OF LIGHT FROM THE HOUSE PIERCE THE DARKNESS UNDER WATER. THE BLURRED
IMAGE OF A DISTANT FIGURE HIGH ABOVE ON A BALCONY FLICKERS AND DISAPPEARS.

The last of the tarp slides out from under the sandbags that old it in place
around the edge of the pool.

The rain keeps falling.

The tarp moves like it's alive underwater. It shifts and wraps David tighter with
every movement.

GLIMPSES OF LIGHT AGAIN. TWO SMALL FIGURES NOW STAND IN A BLURRED SILHOUETTE NEAR
THE EDGE OF THE POOL. FLASHES OF SOMETHING SHINY THEY'RE HOLDING... A ROD OR
POLE... IT'S SHAKY NEBULOUS IMAGE WAIVERS IN THE AIR ABOVE THE SURFACE.

David's only free hand reaches for the light. It catches the silver pole.

The tangled mass of David and the tarp are pulled slowly towards the edge of the
pool. David's head and shoulders emerge from the darkness. He takes hold of the
pool's edge.

Huge desperate breaths as he pulls his body out from the water and the grasp of
the tarp. He hauls himself onto the ground.

He sits hunched over in a dark mass, his head down under his hood. The rain
poncho covering him like a blanket. Beat.

He rises to his feet. The water rushes off of him. His breathing is slowing,
calming.

He stands in a silhouette from the light of the house. He turns and looks to the
two small figures standing near the edge of the pool.

The children from the bathroom stand still in the rain. They're holding an
aluminum pole with a brush head for cleaning the pool. They stare up at the
hooded figure.

No one says anything.

								  CUT TO:

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

The man in the orange one-piece uniform stands over the woman tied to the door
handle of the bathroom. His back is to us. He's drinking from a beer bottle as he
looks down at her.

He doesn't notice the third presence come into the room. He doesn't hear him move
closer. Right behind him.

The man in orange takes another sip of his beer, not realizing an arm is reaching
over him... He doesn't get to swallow the sip in his mouth.

David Dunne's powerful arm wraps around the man's thick neck. David's hands clamp
together like and iron vise. He squeezes.

The man's beer bottle crashes to the ground as his neck begins to get crushed.

David yanks back hard, pulls the man off balance. The man's legs push back
violently, sending both of them backwards across the room. They come to a hard
stop as David's back gets RAMMED INTO THE BEDROOM WALL.

The huge man in orange pulls away and then SLAMS DAVID harder against the wall.
David's arm remains locked around his throat.

The man becomes frantic. His face turning dark red. He clutches at David's arm.
He spins, taking David with him into another wall. The IMPACT IS TREMENDOUS. The
room shakes. David holds on. His face bent low and hidden under his hood.

And then the man in orange throws a powerful elbow back. It lands hard right in
David's side. David groans. The huge man delivers another one. Savage, desperate
blows. WE HEAR THE IMPACT OF EACH ONE WITH DAVID'S BODY. And David never lets go.

The elbows slow and then stop. The legs of the man in orange start to buckle.

David pulls him back onto his heels. He turns him in a half circle. All of his
tremendous weight is hanging from David's arm now. David LETS OUT A YELL AS HE
APPLIES ALL HIS STRENGTH. The man's legs stop kicking.

David keeps turning him. The man's body goes completely limp. David's just
dragging two hundred and seventy-five pounds of weight in a circle over the
carpet now.

David slowly comes to a stop. He stands there with his arm wrapped around the
man's neck....The man's limbs dangle down to the ground. Beat.

David's hands let go of each other. His arm slips out from under the man's jaw.
The man in orange crumples to the ground like a rag doll. The only SOUND IN THE
ROOM IS DAVID'S HEAVY BREATHING. Beat.

He moves to the woman slumped against the door. He starts to untie the phone
cords that bind her wrists to the handle. He whispers to her.

				 DAVID(soft)
		It's over now.
			(beat)
		Your children are fine.
		They're getting help.

He unties her wrists. Her arms stay above her head where they were.

				 DAVID(soft)
		I'm going to go now.

He stares at the woman whose eyes stare blankly at him. She sits unnaturally
still against the door with her arms above her head. The mascara that has run
down her face and dried, has tracks where countless tears have rolled down.

David moves his hand near her mouth and nose. He checks for the feeling of breath
against his hand. Beat.

He rises up. Removes his hood. David Dunne stands silently in the master bedroom
of someone's house and gazes at the dead woman frozen in a slumped position
against her bathroom door.

								  CUT TO:

INT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT

The front door opens to SILENCE. The silhouetted figure of David steps into the
darkness of his home.

								  CUT TO:

INT. CLOSET - NIGHT

The dark green faded security poncho gets hung back on its hook in the closet
next to the family winter coats.

								  CUT TO:

INT. JEREMY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

David enters the quiet of Jeremy's room. Jeremy lays sound asleep. David stares
down at the shadowy figure of his son.

He pulls the blanket over the boy's small shoulder.

								  CUT TO:

INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

David sits on the edge of the empty bed in the darkness of his room.

He doesn't makes a sound. He doesn't move an inch. He is so still, he seems to
disappear into the shadows of the room.

								  CUT TO:

INT. GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

Megan stirs in her sleep. She shifts her head on the pillow.

Then her body RISES INTO THE AIR.

She starts to wake as she floats across the room. She opens her eyes and sees
David close by. He's carrying her in her arms. He moves up the stairs with her.
No words are spoken.

								  CUT TO:

INT. THEIR BEDROOM - NIGHT

They enter their bedroom. David lays her down gently on her side of the bed.

She watches as he walks out of sight. He lays down right behind her.

He covers her with his arm... His hand is shaking. Beat. He speaks softly.

				 DAVID(soft)
		I had a bad dream.

David tucks his head in close to hers and closes his eyes.

Megan lays stunned in her husband's arms. Beat.

				 MEGAN(soft)
		It's over now.

She closes her eyes too as the tears start coming.

						DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. STREET - DAY

Downtown Philadelphia.

People move up and down the sidewalks in front of the storefronts. David Dunne is
among them.

He crosses the street in front of The Limited Edition. The front doors of the
store are open.

A banner over the door reads, "Annual Sale."

								  CUT TO:

INT. LIMITED EDITION - DAY

The compact store is crowded with customers.

David spots Elijah with a group of people before a framed painting of a comic
hero.

David moves to a less crowded area of the store and waits. He turns and looks at
a framed sketch.

Beat. An older woman walks over from a near by picture and joins David.

				 WOMAN
		...See the villain's eyes.
		They're larger than the
		other characters'. They
		insinuate a slightly skewed
		perspective of how they see
		the world. Just off normal.

David stares at the drawing.

				 DAVID
		He doesn't look very
		threatening.

				 WOMAN
		That's what I said to my
		son. He said, there's always
		two kinds. The soldier
		villain who fights the hero
		with his hands, and then
		there's the real threat. The
		brilliant and evil arch
		enemy who fights the hero
		with his mind.

David turns and looks at the striking and beautiful African American woman in her
sixties who stands next to him.

				 DAVID
		Are you Elijah's mother?

The woman turns and looks at David for the first time.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		I am. I'm helping him with
		the sale.

				 DAVID
		It's a pleasure to meet you.
		I'm David Dunne.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		He's spoken of you. He says
		you're becoming friends.

				 DAVID
		We are.

David looks across the store at Elijah talking with the customers.

				 DAVID
		He's doing well today.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		I'm very proud of him.
			(beat)
		He's been through a lot in
		his life. A lot of ups and
		downs, a lot of bad spells.
		A couple I'd thought had
		broken him... I mean
		emotionally.
			(beat)
		They were bad... But he made
		it. Yes he did.

				 DAVID
		He's kind of a miracle.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		Yes he is.

They both watch Elijah from across the room.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		I'll tell him you're here.

David watches as Elijah's mother walks across the store and waits for Elijah to
finish talking.

David turns back to the framed sketch. He looks at it with his hands in his
pockets. Beat.

David's stare turns into a gaze. His gaze turns into stillness.

THE SKETCH is of a withered man with large tense eyes. He sits in the shadows.
He's seated in some type of machine. There are lots of buttons and levers on the
machine. The machine has wheels.

David turns from the sketch. He looks across the room to Elijah seated in his
wheelchair. Elijah's large eyes stay focused on the customer's as he finishes
negotiating.

David turns back to the sketch. He looks at it with growing confusion. The more
you look at drawing, the more the machine the man is seated in looks like a
wheelchair.

David looks back across the store. Elijah and his mother are talking. Elijah has
spotted David.

Beat. Elijah starts across the crowded store towards David. He wheels up to him.

				 ELIJAH
		Did you see this?

Elijah has a newspaper on his lap. He holds it up.

There's a drawing on the front page. It's a hooded figure shielding two huddled
children behind him.

				 ELIJAH(soft)
		It has begun.

David stares quietly at the sketch of himself.

				 ELIJAH
		When I saw it this morning.
		I felt a part of the world
		again.

Elijah looks down at the newspaper.

David hesitates and then reaches forward.

He reaches past the paper... And TOUCHES ELIJAH'S ARM.

FLASHCUT: AN AIRPORT GATE. ELIJAH IS STANDING AT THE WINDOW LOOKING OUT ONTO THE
AIRFIELD. HE'S CRYING.

SIRENS START SOUNDING THROUGHOUT THE AIRPORT.

WAITING PASSENGERS START GETTING UP AND MOVING TO THE WINDOWS.

				 MAN
		What's going on?

Elijah speaks to no one in particular as he stares out the window with tortured
eyes.

				 ELIJAH
		A plane just crashed.

								  CUT TO:

FLASH CUT: ELIJAH AND AN ELDERLY MAN IN A UNIFORM ARE SEATED IN A HOTEL BAR.

				 ELDERLY MAN
		I've worked here twenty-five
		years. I know all its
		secrets.

				 ELIJAH
		Secrets?

				 ELDERLY MAN(whispers)
		Like if there was ever a
		fire on floors one, two, or
		three... Everyone in this
		hotel would be burned alive.

ELIJAH LOOKS UP FROM HIS DRINK.

								  CUT TO:

FLASHCUT: ELIJAH LEAVES THE ENGINEERING ROOM OF AN AMTRAK TRAIN. HE PASSES THE
ENGINEER WHO HAS JUST ARRIVED WITH COFFEE.

				 ENGINEER
		Passengers aren't allowed in
		there.

Elijah doesn't answer and doesn't turn around as he exits train 177.

SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

David takes two unsteady steps back. Elijah has tears in his eyes as he gazes
down at the newspaper. He looks up to David.

				 ELIJAH(low voice)
		I almost gave up hope. There
		were so many times I
		questioned myself. I've made
		so many sacrifices but it's
		all been worth it.
			(beat)
		There are millions and
		millions or mediocre people
		in the world David. Isn't it
		great that we aren't one of
		them?

David looks like he stopped breathing as he backs up in the store.

Customers step between him and Elijah. Elijah becomes obscured and then blocked
from view.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - DAY

David emerges from the store slowly. He braces himself against a parked car and
then keeps on walking in a nightmarish daze.

WE PULL BACK as David Dunne blends in with dozens and dozens of ordinary people,
walking on an ordinary street, in an ordinary city.

INT. CLOTHING STORE - AFTERNOON

Women's casual wear department. J.C. Penny.

Legend "1961"

An African-American man carrying two J.C. Penny shopping bags is ushered past the
department store managers and security guards on walkies that have gathered at
the entrance to the woman's dressing rooms.

								  CUT TO:

INT. DRESSING ROOM - AFTERNOON

A bed has been formed by a chair and three benches.

A STRIKING AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN in her twenties lays across it. Her face and
clothes are covered in sweat. Her skirt is stained.

She holds something wrapped in a soft sweatshirt on her chest. We can't see it,
but WE HEAR THE BABY CRYING.

She's just given birth.

There are three frazzled saleswomen in the dressing room with her. They watch her
with quiet smiles.

A fourth SALESWOMAN arrives ushering in the man with the shopping bags.

				 SALESWOMAN
		This is Mr. Mathison. He's
		a doctor.

DR. MATHISON looks over the scene and then directly at the striking woman.

				 DR. MATHISON
		You okay?

The woman nods, "Yes." Sweat trickles down her face. THE BABY'S PIERCING CRIES
ECHO IN THE SMALL ROOM.

				 SALESWOMAN
		An ambulance is on the way.

Dr. Mathison puts down his shopping bags and moves to her. He kneels down and
gestures for the bundle of sweatshirts in her arms.

				 DR. MATHISON
		Is there a name yet?

Beat. The woman smiles for the first time.

				 WOMAN
		Elijah.

She hands him the wrapped child. We can't see the baby, but THE PIERCING CRIES
SEEM TO GET LOUDER.

				 WOMAN
		Is he supposed to be crying
		like that?

The doctor lowers the baby to his lap and unwraps him.

The woman can't see her baby anymore. She watches Dr. Mathison as he looks down
and examines her child. Beat. Dr. Mathison doesn't look up for the longest time.

				 WOMAN
		Can I have him back?

THE BABY'S CRYING IS RELENTLESS. UNNERVING. Beat.

The doctor finally glances up. He looks shaken. He makes eye contact with the
woman for only a second. It's enough. A chill goes through her body.

He looks to the three saleswomen who were in the room.

				 DR. MATHISON
		What happened during the
		delivery?

His hard stare unsettles the women. The OLDER SALESWOMAN speaks up.

				 OLDER SALESWOMAN
		Nothing. It was very quick.
		The baby just wanted to come
		right out. There was no
		problems.

				 DR. MATHISON
		Did you drop him?

Everyone becomes very still. The mother looks like she stopped breathing. THE
BABY'S SCREAMING ENGULFS THE ROOM.

				 DR. MATHISON
		Did you drop this baby?

Beat.

				 OLDER SALESWOMAN
		Jesus Christ, no.

The BABY SCREAMS.

The doctor whispers something to himself, we can't hear. He looks up to the
saleswoman who brought him in.

				 DR. MATHISON
		Please inform the ambulance
		we have a situation...

Dr. Mathison turns back to the mother. Beat.

				 DR. MATHISON
		I've never seen this... It
		appears your infant
		sustained some fractures
		while in your uterus.
			(beat)
		His arms and legs are
		broken.

								FADE TO BLACK:

EXT. TRAIN STATION NEW JERSEY - DAY

LEGEND "PRESENT DAY"

A fountain of humanity bubbles up from the escalators to the train platform.

Businessmen take their last desperate drags of their cigarettes... Women
traveling with children herd their luggage and offspring into tight shapes as
they move... College students with backpacks look around dazed at the various
track numbers.

				 ANNOUNCER(o.s.)
		Last call track three,
		Amtrak Clocker making it's
		final stop at Philadelphia's
		thirtieth street station.
		First two passenger cars
		only. First two cars only.

A face inside the train watches the stream of passengers emerging from the
escalators. DAVID DUNNE, a man in his early forties, rest his temple against the
glass and quietly observes the movement outside.

The train starts to pull out.

								  CUT TO:

INT. PASSENGER CAR - DAY

David sits with his coat on his lap. He's wearing a tie. He doesn't look very
comfortable in it.

He feels a stare. He looks up to find a girl, six or seven years old, peering at
him from over the seat in front of him. She just gazes at him blankly.

He gives her a small forced smile. She doesn't react. David returns his head to
the window.

His eyes begin to shut with the lulling movement of the train.

				 WOMAN(o.s.)
		You alone?

David looks in the direction of THE VOICE. A WOMAN with dark hair and light blue
eyes stands in the aisle with two bags over her shoulder. She's wearing a tight
white t-shirt and jeans. She's beautiful.

David nods "yes."

The woman starts putting her bags on the shelf above the seats. She stretches to
get them up. Her toned stomach is exposed. She has a silver ring pierced through
her navel.

David has a gold ring on his hand. He fiddles with it. Beat. He gently slips off
his wedding band. It goes into his coat pocket.

The woman takes the seat next to him.

Beat. A LOUD VIOLENT BURST OF SOUND. The passenger car shakes as a passing
train barrels by two feet from David's window. It passes in a few seconds. The
car returns to a QUIET HUM.

David pulls a magazine out from the seat pocket in front of him.

He holds the woman's fashion magazine out.

				 DAVID
		Someone left these. You want
		one?

The woman looks over the one being offered and then points to the Sports
Illustrated peeking out of the seat pocket.

David pulls the magazine out and gives it to her.

				 DAVID
		You like sports?

				 WOMAN
		It's my field. I represent
		athletes. I'm an agent.

				 DAVID
		What a coincidence? I'm a
		male synchronized swimmer
		and I'm looking for
		representation.

				 WOMAN(smiling)
		Is that right?

				 DAVID
		But I'm afraid of water, so
		that's been holding my
		career back a little bit.

The woman laughs.

				 DAVID
		You represent someone in
		Philadelphia?

				 WOMAN
		I'm meeting a player from
		Temple University. He's a
		cornerback. You like
		football?

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Not really.

				 WOMAN
		This kid is six foot two,
		two hundred and forty
		pounds. He runs the fifty in
		under six seconds. He's
		going to be a God.

Beat. David studies the excitement in her eyes.

ANOTHER LOUD VIOLENT BURST OF SOUND. David waits till the opposing train passes.
The woman goes back to her magazine. Beat.

				 DAVID
		I'm David Dunne.

The woman looks up.

				 WOMAN
		Kelly.

She goes back to the magazine.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		How long are you staying in
		Philly?

KELLY looks up from her Sports Illustrated. Her striking blue eyes gaze at David.
Beat.

She holds up her hand. Taps the diamond ring on her finger.

				 KELLY(soft)
		I'm married.

				 DAVID(fake excitement)
		Great.

Beat.

				 KELLY
		Sorry.

				 DAVID(fake confusion)
		What are you talking about?

An awkward silence.

				 DAVID
		I think you got the wrong
		idea.

The woman stares at David. She looks down. Beat. Closes the magazine.

				 KELLY
		I'm going to find another
		seat.

Kelly gets up. She balances herself against a headrest as the train rumbles. She
starts to the back of the car.

David sits alone. He looks like he's drowning, but there's no water.

He feels a stare. He glances up. The little girl spies on him from between the
seats.

David leans towards the window to avoid eye contact. His hand reaches into his
coat and slides out his wedding band. He puts it back on.

His temple touches the glass. The vibration of the train begins to lull his eyes
closed... Beat.

David's head bounces lightly against the window.

The shaking of the glass never allows David's eyes to completely close.

He sits up when he realizes the shaking is getting stronger.

He looks out the window. The scenery blurs as it flies by. Beat.

David turns. Some of the other passengers start to react as they realize the
train is picking up speed.

The normal bumps of the tracks become amplified.

The WORRIED VOICES OF THE TRAVELERS START FILL THE CABIN.

The train goes faster.

AND THEN THE HIGH PITCHED METAL ON METAL SCREECHING STARTS AS THE TRAIN BEGINS TO
TAKE A CURVE.

David's eyes move to the seat in front of him. The little girl is no longer
watching him.

DAVID LOOKS TO THE PASSENGERS ACROSS FROM HIM. He sees the ground slowly drop
away in the windows behind them as THEIR SIDE OF THE TRAIN STARTS TO RISE...

THE PASSENGERS SCREAM AS THE AMTRAK PASSENGER TRAIN BEGINS TO TILT OFF THE
TRACK...

								  CUT TO:

INT. FAMILY ROOM - AFTERNOON

A boy, age ten, sits on his head on the family couch and watches television
upside down. His floppy brown hair spreads out in a circle in front of his red
face. He changes channels with a remote control.

He moves past the upside down cartoons and the upside down talk shows. He stops
on an upside down picture of a crashed train. Beat.

His knees come forward as he flips over. He tumbles slowly off the couch and onto
the carpet. JEREMY DUNNE gazes at the television screen... A LIVE AERIAL VIEW OF
A TRAIN WRECK SMOULDERING BELOW IS SEEN. Two trains are tangled like snakes.

Jeremy gets up and moves to a small table with a phone. Next to the phone is a
notepad. On it is written...

"Dad - Amtrak 177 - 3:40pm."

Jeremy looks at the television. At the bottom of the screen in red block letters
that move from right to left are words and numbers..."The 3:40 Amtrak 177 has
derailed... Amtrak Emergency number is 1-800-777-4322... The 3:40 Amtrak 177 has
derailed...Amtrak"

Jeremy doesn't take his eyes off the screen. He makes a small desperate noise
that no one hears.

								  CUT TO:

INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON

An elderly woman can't hold back any longer and SCREAMS. An embarrassed, tortured
helpless scream.

MEGAN DUNNE continues applying pressure to her arm which is being pushed back as
far as it will go.

She counts to three and eases off. She lays her arm back in her lap.

WE ARE IN A PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER. About a dozen people are on specialized
weight machines.

The elderly woman is seated on an exercise table and breathes slowly.

				 MEGAN
		You okay, Virginia?

Beat. VIRGINIA shakes her head, "No."

				 MEGAN
		I'll put something on the
		t.v. Maybe we'll find some
		almost naked guys to inspire
		you.

Megan reaches up to the t.v. monitor mounted on the wall. She turns it on and
starts flipping channels. She stops on ESPN where a swimming meet is underway.
Men in bikini swimsuits line the edges of the pool.

Virginia starts watching with great interest.

Megan's eyes move to the tiny print moving across the bottom of the screen. Her
face goes still as she reads the train number... 177.

								  CUT TO:

INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - AFTERNOON

DAVID DUNNE'S EYES SLOWLY OPEN. THE DULL WHITE OF THE OVERHEAD TUBE LIGHTING
BLINDS HIM AT FIRST.

He blinks his vision back. He realizes he's in a bed.

WE HEAR AGITATED VOICES, MOVEMENT.

David looks around. He's in an emergency room. There are a half dozen prep areas
and beds next to him. They're all empty.

DAVID FOLLOWS THE URGENT SOUNDS OF ACTIVITY TO A PREP AREA DIRECTLY ACROSS FROM
HIM.

He can only see glimpses of activity through the drawn curtain. A group of
emergency room personnel are treating a man whose body is twitching violently on
a gurney.

One of the group is a man who glances through the opening in the curtain. He
notices David sitting up from across the room.

THE MAN IN SCRUBS leaves the group and walks over.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		How are you feeling?

				 DAVID
		Okay.

He FLASHES A LIGHT in David's eyes.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		You are in the emergency
		room of the University of
		Pennsylvania Hospital. You
		were in a serious accident.
			(beat)
		How's your vision?

				 DAVID
		Fine.

David stares across as the scene with the other patients becomes more frantic and
disturbing.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		Where were you sitting on
		the train?

				 DAVID
		Against a window.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		In the passenger car?

				 DAVID
		Yes. Where are the rest of
		the passengers?

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		Was your family traveling
		with you?

				 DAVID
		No.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		Did you get up from your
		seat?

				 DAVID
		No.

David watches the other patient.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		You're certain you were in
		the passenger car?

David turns to the man.

				 DAVID
		Yes... Why are you looking
		at me like that?

Beat.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		Your train derailed... Some
		kind of malfunction... It
		took a curve way to fast. A
		second train collided with
		yours after it derailed. The
		debris is spread over one
		mile. It's unbelievable they
		said.
			(beat)
		They only found two people
		alive so far... You and him.

David looks to the other passenger now laying unnaturally still in the desperate
whirlwind of activity around him.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		The man's skull was cracked
		open and most of his left
		side was crushed.

Beat.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		And to answer your question,
		there are two reasons why
		I'm looking at you like
		this.

David turns and stares at the man.

				 MAN IN SCRUBS
		One, because it seems, in a
		few minutes, you will
		officially be the only
		survivor of this train
		wreck.
			(beat)
		And two, because you don't
		have a scratch on you. You
		didn't break one bone.

								  CUT TO:

INT. EMERGENCY RECEPTION AREA - EVENING

David moves through the depressing milky corridors of the hospital. He opens a
set of double doors.

A room crammed with cameras and photographers explodes with movement.

A CHILD'S VOICE BREAKS THEIR NOISE.

				 JEREMY
		I told you!

Jeremy Dunne pushes forward through the mob of people and cameras. He bursts out
and runs to David. He wraps his arms around David's waist. David just stands
there, aware that the cameras are catching it all. He's overwhelmed.

Hospital staff and a couple police officers push the media back.

Jeremy tugs David to lean down. He does.

				 JEREMY
		They thought everybody on
		the train died.

David looks at his son's face. Wipes the tears on his cheek.

				 JEREMY
		I told them they were wrong.

A woman moves to them. David stands up and faces Megan Dunne.

				 JEREMY
		Mom even cried.

David looks at Megan's eyes.

				 JEREMY
		A lot.

Megan looks away.

				 MEGAN
		Not a lot.

They stand there for a moment. David looks shaken. Jeremy takes hold of his hand.

				 JEREMY
		Let's go home.

Megan nods. They move to the exit. The pack of cameras and reporters burst to
life as they leave the building. They jockey for position to get a last glimpse
of David Dunne.

								  CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

David eats a bowl of pasta alone in a modest kitchen. He stares at his hand.
Opens and closes it slowly. Beat.

He rises and puts the bowl away in the sink.

INT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT

David stops just before rising the stairs. He glances into a bedroom at the
bottom of the stairs. The doorway is half open. He makes eye contact with his
wife. Beat.

				 DAVID
		I don't think I got the job
		in New York.

				 MEGAN
		What does that mean?

				 DAVID
		I'm still going to New York.
		Just not this second.

				 MEGAN
		I don't want to drag this
		out too long for Jeremy.

				 DAVID
		I know.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		How about in the meantime,
		you don't sleep in the
		guestroom anymore?
			(beat)
		You sleep in our room. I'll
		sleep down here.

Beat.

				 MEGAN
		It stopped being our room a
		long time ago.
			(beat)
		You should go up and get
		some rest.

Beat. Megan slowly closes the door to the guest bedroom.

								  CUT TO:

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

David looks at his son asleep in his bed.

				 DAVID
		Jeremy, why don't you go
		sleep with your mom?

				 JEREMY(eyes closed)
		I want to sleep here
		tonight.

				 DAVID
		I think it's be better if I
		was alone.

				 JEREMY(eyes closed)
		I won't make any noise.

				 DAVID
		How about your room then? If
		you get scared like before,
		you can come back in here?

Beat. Jeremy doesn't answer because he's asleep. David rubs his forehead and gets
up. He turns on the t.v., low volume, as he moves into the bathroom.

								  CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Hot water rushes over David's face as he stands in the shower. His attention is
drawn to the t.v. which is seen through the slightly open bathroom door.

He turns off the water to HEAR.

				 NEWS ANCHOR(t.v.)
		...Derailed approximately
		seven and half miles outside
		Philadelphia. It came to
		rest on its side on the
		northbound tracks. It is
		train officials belief that
		some if not most of the
		passengers were still alive
		at this time.

				 NEWS ANCHOR(t.v.)
		The momentary peace lasted
		only a few seconds. A Boston
		bound freight train on the
		northbound tracks was
		seconds away from passing
		train 177 when it derailed.
		The impact happened at about
		three-fifteen p.m. The first
		of the two occupied
		passenger cars was severed
		in half and sent careening
		in two directions. The
		second of the passenger cars
		was crushed and dragged for
		four hundred feet. Six crew
		members were on the freight.
		One hundred and eighteen
		passengers and seven crew
		members were on the
		passenger train... There is
		one reported survivor.
			(beat)
		Rescue teams will be working
		for the next forty-eight
		hours removing bodies and
		debris.

David steps out of the shower. He sees a glimpse of Jeremy asleep in bed. David
shuts the door. Locks it.

He gets back into the shower and turns the water back on.

He closes his eyes. His face tightens up. He slowly hunches down and takes a seat
on the tiled floor of the shower. Water pours over him. Beat.

His muscular body begins to shake. Then we realize he's crying.

								FADE TO BLACK:

EXT. FAIR - DAY

LEGEND "1969"

A hazy afternoon. A fair has come into town. They have set up in the vast parking
lot of the local high school.

A line of women has formed in front of the portable bathrooms.

The striking African American woman we saw giving birth is now standing in line.
She is older and somehow more beautiful.

She stands with a skinny, almost ethereal looking African American boy. The boy
wears a metal brace on his leg. THE EIGHT YEAR OLD ELIJAH holds two oversized
stuffed animals in his arms. He looks back over his shoulder as THE SOUND OF
VOICES YELLING IN EXCITEMENT FILL THE AIR. His eyes dance over the many colorful
rides in the parking lot.

The door opens to one of the portable bathrooms. A woman steps out.

Elijah's mother touches his head and enters the three foot square plastic
bathroom. She turns back and gives him a look.

				 MOTHER
		We'll play the water pistol
		game next.

Elijah nods, "Yes" happily.

The mother closes the cubicle door. Elijah is left alone amongst the line of
women. They stare at him blankly. Their eyes moves over his leg brace. Elijah
doesn't like it. He moves away from the line.

A CRESCENDO OF CHEERS RISES IN THE AIR FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE FAIR. Elijah follows
the voices. He carries the stuffed animals through the crowds of people. CLICK.
CLICK. CLICK. His metal brace sounds as he walks.

For a moment, he sees nothing but bodies all around him.

He emerges amongst a huddle of teenagers who wait at a turnstile.

A man in a red and white striped coat takes their tickets and waves them in.

Elijah looks up and sees the sign above the turnstile... "The Hurricane."

He watches the teenagers giggle as they each into a grey cup-like seat. They pull
the metal bars down in front of them.

The man in the red and white stripes leaves the turnstile.

Elijah stares up at the multi-colored sign. Beat. He moves quickly. Ducks under
the turnstile and climbs onto the platform.

Elijah finds and empty circular seat. He slips inside the gray metal compartment
and sits. He pulls down the rusted metal bar in front of him.

He looks around at all the excited faces. His eyes fill with excitement too.

His small hands feel the cold metal of the interior of the compartment. His
expression changes.

Elijah looks to the stuffed animals in his arms. He presses them to check their
softness. He places the stuffed animals on either side of him on the seat. He's
wedged in between them. Feels good.

He reaches out and touches the hard rusted metal bar in front of him. Elijah
looks a little anxious. Beat.

He pulls off his sweater and wraps it around the bar. It goes around twice before
he ties the arms together. He checks its softness.

Elijah looks around the customized cup-like compartment he sits in. He smiles an
eight year old smile of pride.

AND THEN HE HEARS HIS MOTHER'S VOICE.

He searches around and finds her walking in the waves of people. He hears her
calling.

				 MOTHER
		Elijah...

She moves in his direction by chance. She finds herself at the entrance to The
Hurricane ride. She looks up at the sign above the turnstile. Her worried eyes
immediately start searching the young faces in the gray circular compartments.

Her eyes meet Elijah's. He waves. Her face goes very still.

A HUGE ROAR OF MACHINERY as the ride starts up.

Elijah yells to his mother as the platform starts running.

				 ELIJAH
		I won't get hurt momma! I'm
		safe!

HIS WORDS GET EATEN UP BY THE CHEERS OF THE TEENAGERS AND THE GRIND OF MACHINERY.

The platform spins. He sees a glimpse of his mother and the red and white striped
man. She's pointing at Elijah.

The platform turns... Elijah sees a flash of the red and white striped man's
angered face as he yells at the frantic woman next to him.

And then the ride speeds up.

The gray circular seats start to spin on their own. The teenagers CHEER.

Elijah's eyes fill with joy as the wind plays against his face.

Suddenly the ride changes directions. The cup-like seats get jerked. Everyone
grabs the metal bars to hold on.

Elijah laughs as he smashes into the stuffed animal on his right. It cushions him
and then falls to the floor of the compartment along with the other stuffed
animal.

Elijah's expression becomes tense as his compartment spins. His hands slide over
the rusted metal bar as the sweater unravels.

Elijah looks around... a sudden panic enters his eyes.

THE BLURRING IMAGE OF HIS MOTHER NOW IN A GROUP OF RED AND WHITE STRIPED MEN.

THE SOUND OF MACHINERY GRINDING IS HEARD as the ride changes directions
suddenly.

Elijah's hands rip away from the bar as he gets thrown to the side of the
compartment. His shoulder and arm takes the brunt of the impact. WE HEAR
SOMETHING CRACK.

TEENAGERS SCREAM IN EXCITEMENT. ELIJAH JOINS THEM WITH SCREAMS OF HIS OWN.

The ride spins its passengers. Elijah's small face looks up at the swirling
clouds in a mixture of agony and terror.

The ride changes directions.

Elijah is thrust forward. He hits the rusted metal bar square against his chest.
WE HEAR MORE CRACKS.

The world spins. Giggles and yells fill the air. Elijah slumps down onto the
floor of the compartment.

And then finally, the grind of the machinery slows and then comes to a gradual
stop.

THE TEENAGERS MOAN.

Elijah is facing directly up at the sky. The clouds now move slowly over him.

WE HEAR COMMOTION. AGITATED VOICES. HIS MOTHER'S DESPERATE VOICE.

				 MOTHER(o.s.)
		His bones... He's not
		well...

HER VOICE GETS LOUDER AS SHE MOVES CLOSER TO THE PLATFORM.

				 MOTHER(o.s.)
		Elijah baby...

Then her face appears as she finds the cup-like seat Elijah is in. She begins to
scream.

Elijah lays on the bottom of the compartment. One arm is clutching his chest. The
other is curved horrifically like an "s". His mouth is open. His eyes are
bulging. The last thing we HERE ARE THE SHORT DESPERATE BREATHS of an eight year
old child about to black out from the pain.

								FADE TO BLACK:

PRESENT: EXT. CHURCH - AFTERNOON

WE EMERGE FROM BLACK to find news vans and reporters lining the street across
from a church. They have been cordoned off by a handful of police. Mourners are
recorded as they emerge from their cars and enter the church.

David is among the arriving crowd.

				 MAN(o.s.)
		David Dunne!

At hearing his name, David turns back as he walks. He can't tell which reporter
called his name because all of them seem to react. A storm of camera movement as
the group jockeys for the best angle of his troubled face.

David passes a magnetic board as he enters the church. It reads, "Services for
the families and friends of train 177."

								  CUT TO:

INT. CHURCH - AFTERNOON

A PRIEST stands before a podium.

				 PRIEST
		Sarah Elaston, social worker

		father of six. We pray for

		Drexel University. We pray
		for your soul.

David sits amongst the mourners in the standing room only church. His eyes drift
to a woman two rows ahead of him. She's turned around, looking at him. Her eyes
are red  from crying.

David looks away. His eyes stop on an old man far to his left just a few seats
away. Father, mother and daughter stare silently.

David surveys the entire church... Desperate inconsolable eyes question his
existence from every direction.

David has to look down.

				 PRIEST
		...Jennifer Pennyman, third
		grade teacher at Jefferson
		Elementary.
			(beat)
		We pray for your soul.

								  CUT TO:

INT. BACK OF CHURCH - AFTERNOON

David and the priest who conducted the mass are alone in the mass preparation
room. The priest looks in his fifties, eyes tired, blood shot.

				 DAVID
		I used to play football in
		college. In my first year as
		quarterback, we went on this
		winning streak. It just went
		on and on. It didn't matter
		who we played... I'd always
		win.
			(beat)
		You get superstitious when
		something like that happens.
		You give things meaning.
		Like you wear the same color
		socks each game or you
		listen to the same B.B. King
		song before you leave the
		apartment. I wouldn't even
		untie the shoelaces on my
		cleats. I'd just slip them
		on and off so nothing would
		change... I gave things
		meaning that had no meaning.
			(beat)
		I'm here to make sure I'm
		not making shoelaces into
		something they're not again.
			(beat)
		I was the only person to
		survive that accident. The
		only one... It feels like it
		means something.

Beat.

				 PRIEST
		Are you a religious man,
		David?

David nods, "No."

The priest removes the sacred stoll from his around his neck and kisses it before
folding it carefully.

				 PRIEST
		Good. Because I'm going to
		talk to you as a man. Not as
		a man of the cloth.

				 DAVID
		Okay.

Beat. The priest turns to David.

				 PRIEST
		It was luck.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		What do you mean?

				 PRIEST
		Luck... Random... Without
		meaning.

David just sits awkwardly.

				 PRIEST
		Three years ago, my cousin
		died on a plane that crashed
		on take off at Philadelphia
		International airport. Do
		you remember that crash?

David nods, "Yes."

				 PRIEST
		I prayed and prayed and
		finally found some meaning
		in the event. It gave me
		peace... And then not quite
		a year later, an entire
		family from my parish burned
		to death in a hotel fire
		downtown...
			(beat)
		Again I prayed. Again I
		found  meaning.
			(beat)
		Just two days ago, my nephew
		rode with you on that train
		back from New York. He was
		traveling alone for the
		first time.

				 PRIEST
		I'm sorry if I can't react
		to your survival with the
		appropriate 'It was the hand
		of God. It was a miracle.'
		kind of answer... I'm fresh
		out of those right now.

David is shaken. Beat.

				 DAVID(soft)
		The metal of the watch I was
		wearing was crushed like a
		sledge hammer hit it.

Beat. The priest's eyes fill with emotion.

				 PRIEST
		My twelve year old nephew's
		neck was broken in four
		places... What's your point?
		You were chosen?
			(beat)
		I don't think so.

The priest turns and continues putting away artifacts from the mass. Silence
fills the back room.

								  CUT TO:

INT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON

No cameras greet his exit. No people anywhere.

David walks across the now empty parking lot. His car is the only one left.

He walks to the driver's side. Pulls out his keys. That's as far as he gets.

His eyes catch sight of the GRAY ENVELOPE tucked under the windshield wiper of
his car.

David moves forward and gently pulls it out. His name is typed on the front. He
turns it over. Two embossed words on the back.

				 "Limited Edition"

He opens the envelope. One line, handwritten, gazes at him from the gray index
card.

The line reads...

  "How many days of your life have you been sick?"

Nothing else is written.

David Dunne looks around the empty parking lot quietly.

								  CUT TO:

INT. EMPLOYEE LOCKER ROOM - MORNING

A poorly lit changing room. A row of metallic lockers sits against one wall. A
bench splits the room. A brown folding table with Dunkin Donuts boxes and bagels
on it is crammed in the corner. A puke colored concrete floor sets the tone.

David and three other large men are changing out of their street clothes. They
all put on the same yellow short sleeve shirts. The same two words are written on
all their backs...

"Stadium Security"

This ritual goes on without a word.

								  CUT TO:

INT. MAIN STADIUM CORRIDOR - MORNING

David walks along the massive curved wall around the outer rim of the stadium. As
he passes the different walkways we get glimpses of the enormous and empty
sixty-thousand seat football stadium on the inside.

David stops at a door marked "PERSONNEL".

								  CUT TO:

INT. PERSONNEL OFFICE - MORNING

David knocks on the door as he steps into the cramped reception room to the
personnel office.

The SECRETARY, an ancient woman with thick flabby arms never stops typing and
never looks up as she talks.

				 ANCIENT SECRETARY
		Yes?

				 DAVID
		Is Noel in?

				 ANCIENT SECRETARY
		No sir he is not.
			(beat)
		I read about you in the
		paper.

				 DAVID
		Oh.

				 ANCIENT SECRETARY
		I was in an accident once
		too. A horse almost trampled
		me to death.

				 DAVID
		Wow.

				 ANCIENT SECRETARY
		I had to put him down.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		That's a sad story.
			(beat)
		Do you think you could ask
		Noel something for me?

The ancient secretary's right hand immediately picks up a pen and positions it
over a blank pad. Her left hand keeps typing. She never looks up.

				 ANCIENT SECRETARY
		Proceed.

				 DAVID
		Ask if he can check how many
		sick days I've taken since
		I've worked here?

Beat.

				 ANCIENT SECRETARY
		Is that the entire message?

				 DAVID
		Yes.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. STADIUM FIELD - AFTERNOON

Rain falls in sheets in the stadium.

David stands at the entrance to a tunnel that empties out onto the field. He
stands in an imposing dark green rain poncho and hood. The poncho almost touches
the ground. The word 'security' on the back has almost faded away. We can barely
see David's face under the hood.

There is a football game in progress on the enormous field. The players seem
unusually small. There is no one in the stands. About four hundred people are on
the sidelines of the field watching the players. A soggy limping banner stretched
behind them declares, "The Pennslvania Elementary School Championships."

David's eyes scan the tiny figures on the field. His eyes come rest on a surge of
activity on the sidelines. Beat.

David steps out into the rain.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. SIDELINES - AFTERNOON

A handful of red faced fathers are yelling at each other. They're in each other's
rain soaked faces. The scene feels on the verge of physical violence.

David and another security guard jog over. David steps in the middle of the tight
circle. The men stop yelling in the presence of stadium security. Everyone just
stands in the rain glaring at each other. Beat.

				 DAVID
		You know what I think about
		to calm down? I think about
		those big fat, hundred and
		twenty pound turtles that
		live in the islands. Those
		suckers never get angry,
		never get in fights and live
		longer than all of us and
		all they do all is sit on
		the beach and hump other
		turtles.
			(beat)
		Why don't we take a second
		and think about the turtles?

Nobody moves. Rain washes over the agitated faces. A father breaks the moment.

				 FATHER
		Yeah Jerry why don't you
		think about the fat ass
		turtles... Like your fat ass
		son on the field
		jeopardizing the rest of our
		chances at a fucking
		championship.

David tenses. Everyone looks to JERRY. A bald man who stands just a foot away.
Jerry nods to himself. Looks like he's going to say something. Instead he lunges
forward and smashes a HEADBUTT to the man who spoke to him.

David tackles Jerry hard and fast. He drives him into the ground.

Blood starts rushing out of the nose of the dazed father who took the headbutt.

The other fathers start yelling and pushing each other. The remaining security
guard calls on his walkie for assistance.

David keeps Jerry immobilized in a powerful arm and head lock that holds the
man's enraged face hard into the wet surface of the field.

David's eyes are not on Jerry. They gaze out onto the field where twenty two
elementary school boys have stopped playing and are standing frozen, helmets off,
rain washing over their faces. They watch in horror as their parents attack each
other on the sidelines.

								  CUT TO:

INT. EMPLOYEE LOCKER ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

David is the last one left. He's showered and back in his street clothes. He sits
in the dimly lit room on the bench, lost in his thoughts when the door opens.

He turns to find a somewhat pregnant looking man with a tie step in. This is
NOEL.

				 DAVID
		Hey Noel.

Beat. He just stares.

				 NOEL
		Forty dollars.

David turns on the bench.

				 DAVID
		What?

				 NOEL
		You're getting a forty
		dollar raise per week...
		that's it.

Silence.

				 NOEL
		I checked. You were right.
		You've never taken a sick

			(beat)
		Five years, no sick days. I
		get it. You want a raise.
		You made your point.

The room is still. Beat.

				 NOEL
		All right fifty dollars and
		that's the god damn limit.
			(beat)
		Are we done here?

Beat. David nods, "Yes."

								  CUT TO:

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

LIGHTS OUT.

David is wide awake in his bed. He glances over. Jeremy is in deep sleep next to
him.

								  CUT TO:

INT. GUEST ROOM - NIGHT

David knocks again quietly. The guest bedroom door opens.

Megan looks up at David. She's just woken up.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Is Jeremy okay?

				 DAVID(low voice)
		He's asleep.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Oh.

Beat. They both stand awkwardly for a moment.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		I wanted to ask you a
		question. It'll sound
		strange, but just think
		about it for a second.

Megan nods, "Yes."

				 DAVID(low voice)
		When's the last time I was
		sick? You remember?

Megan tries to mask her reaction to the oddness of the question. Beat.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		I don't know. It's been a
		while.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		I haven't been sick this
		year. I know that.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Okay.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		Do you remember me getting
		sick?

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Not a specific day. What's
		this about?

				 DAVID (low voice)
		Megan, do you ever remember
		me getting sick?

Beat.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		In the three years we've
		been in this house?... In
		the old apartment?... Before
		Jeremy was born?... Before
		we were married?

Beat.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		...I can't remember.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		That's strange isn't it? Not
		remembering one fever... Or
		a cold... Or a sore throat.
		What do you think that
		means?

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		It means we're probably to
		tired to remember.

David becomes quiet as he thinks. Beat.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Is that what you wanted to
		ask me?

				 DAVID(low voice)
		Yes.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Is there anything else you
		wanted to ask me while I'm
		up?...

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		...When was the last time
		you wore pink? When was the
		last time you drank soup
		standing up? Final call for
		strange questions at two in
		the morning.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		No that's it.

David seems lost in his thoughts.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Maybe you should go up.
		Jeremy might see you're gone
		and get frightened.
			(beat)
		The train thing, really
		shook him up. He's scared
		something's going to happen
		to you. He doesn't want to
		let you out of his sight.

David stares at Megan. Beat.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		Yeah. I know.

There's silence for a bit.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		When was the last time I
		wore pink?

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		The Mitchell barbecue three
		years ago.

				 DAVID(realizing)
		Oh shit...

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Matching shirt and shorts.
		It was brutal.

David half-smiles as Megan turns and starts back into the guest room.

				 DAVID(low voice)
		Goodnight Megan.

Megan looks back at her husband. Just for a moment. Then she looks down.

				 MEGAN(low voice)
		Goodnight David.

Megan closes the door slowly shut.

								FADE TO BLACK:

INT. BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

WE EMERGE in a cramped sparse bedroom.

LEGEND "1974"

A thirteen year old Elijah sits in a chair with his arm in a sling. He watches a
small black and white television in the corner of the room.

WE HEAR FOOTSTEPS. Elijah's mother walks into the room. She looks around for a
moment, and then moves to the television. Turns it off.

The room GOES SILENT.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		No more sitting in this
		room. I've let it go on long
		enough.

				 ELIJAH
		I'm not going out anymore.
		I'm not getting hurt again.
		This was the last time. I
		told you.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		You can't do anything about
		that. You might fall between
		that chair and this
		television. If that's what
		God has planned for you,
		that's what's going to
		happen. You can't hide from
		it in your room.

Elijah just sits staring at the dark television screen.

				 ELIJAH
		They call me Mr. Glass at
		school. Cause I break like
		glass.

Elijah's face is tense. Unyielding. Beat.

Elijah's mother says the next words in almost a whisper.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		...You make this decision
		now to be afraid...
			(beat)
		And you'll never turn back
		your whole life. You'll
		always be afraid.

Elijah's eyes move from the television to his mother. He sees the emotion in her
face. Neither says anything for a while. Beat.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		...I got a present for you.

				 ELIJAH
		Why?

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		Forget why. Do you want it
		or not?

Elijah thinks it over. He nods, "Yes."

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		Well, go get it then.

				 ELIJAH
		Where is it?

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		On a bench, across the
		street.

Elijah looks at his mother with disbelief.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		You calling me a liar?

She points to the window. Beat. Elijah gets up and moves to the only window in
the room.

The view from his room looks out over a narrow street. On the other side of the
street is a public playground. A handful of children are playing on it.

There are three benches to one side of the swings. On one of them is a THIN
PACKAGE wrapped in brown paper with a bow on it.

Elijah looks to his mom who has joined him at the window.

				 ELIJAH
		Someone's gonna take it.

Beat.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		Then you better get out
		there soon.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. PLAYGROUND - AFTERNOON

Elijah walks across the playground. He's very wary of the other children running
about him.

He walks towards the bench with the present on it. Takes a seat. Puts the package
on his lap. It's flat. The edges of the bend down over his thin legs.

He undoes the white bow. He peels off the clear tape holding the brown paper
together. He unfolds the paper. Beat.

Elijah stares down at the single comic book in his lap.

He feels the shadow of his mother. She takes a seat next to him.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		I bought a whole bunch.
		They'll be one of these
		waiting for you, every time
		you want to come out here.

Beat.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		They said this one has a
		surprise ending.

Elijah looks to his mother. His intelligent piercing eyes take her in for a
moment.

He looks back down at his lap. He opens the first page...

						DISSOLVE TO:

INT. STORE - DAY

The same intelligent piercing eyes, twenty-five years older. Elijah has grown
into a handsome, regal looking man. He leans on a walking stick.

He's looking at an impressively framed charcoal sketch on a wall. Two figures are
depicted on the top of a building locked in fierce battle. One figure is
extremely muscular with a mask. The other is half human, half animal.

				 MAN
		This is from Fritz
		Champion's own library. This
		is before the first issue of
		the comic book hit the
		stands in 1968.

Elijah glances at the BUSINESS MAN standing next to him and then back to the
sketch.

				 ELIJAH
		It's a classic depiction of
		good versus evil. Notice the
		square jaw of Slayer -
		common in most comic book
		heroes. And the slightly
		disproportionate size of
		Jaguaro's body to his head.
		This again is common, but
		only in villains... The
		thing to notice about this
		piece... The thing that
		makes it very, very
		special... is its realistic
		depiction of its figures.
		When the characters
		eventually made it into the
		magazine they were
		exaggerated... as always
		happens.
			(beat)
		This is vintage.

The business man rubs his face. Gazes at the sketch. Beat.

				 BUSINESS MAN
		Wrap it up.

				 ELIJAH
		You've made a considerably
		wise decision.

Elijah starts to the back of the store which we now see is some type of art
gallery where all the framed pictures are images and sketches from comic books.

				 BUSINESS MAN
		My kid's gonna go berserk.

Elijah jams his walking stick into the extra thick carpet and stops. He turns.

				 ELIJAH
		Once again please?

				 BUSINESS MAN
		My son Jeb. It's a gift for
		him.

				 ELIJAH
		How old is Jeb?

				 BUSINESS MAN
		Four.

				 ELIJAH
		No.

Elijah starts back to the businessman shaking his head strongly.

				 ELIJAH
		No, no, no, no no... You
		need to go now.

				 BUSINESS MAN
		What did I say?

				 ELIJAH
		Do you see any Telletubbies
		around here?... Do you see
		a slender plastic tag
		clipped to my shirt with my
		name printed on it?... Do
		you see a little Asian child
		with a blank expression
		sitting outside in a
		mechanical helicopter that
		shakes when you put a
		quarter in it?... No?...
		Well that's what you see at
		a toy store? Any you must
		think this is a toy store,
		cause you're in here
		shopping for an infant named
		Jeb. One of us has made a
		gross error and wasted the
		other person's valuable
		time...

Elijah's eyes pierce through the shaken man.

				 ELIJAH
		This is an art gallery my
		friend. This is piece of
		art...

Elijah points at the sketch.

				 ELIJAH
		This is one of seventeen
		original drawings by Fritz
		Champion remaining in the
		world. It's value will
		triple every year... This
		piece is to be treasured. To
		be cherished... To be
		coveted by every single one
		of your banker friends that
		think they're better than
		you.

The business man stares at the sketch with large eyes. Beat.

				 BUSINESS MAN
		What if I kept it?

Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		I'm listening.

				 BUSINESS MAN
		I'll keep it in my office
		room.

				 ELIJAH
		What about Jeb?

				 BUSINESS MAN
		I have a lock on the door.

Elijah just stares.

				 ELIJAH
		Will it be near a window?

				 BUSINESSMAN
		No direct sunlight will fall
		on it.

Elijah eyes the man for many seconds. Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		Come back in three days.
		I'll think about it.

Elijah starts to the back. He passes the front door as two customers walk in.
Elijah talks over his shoulder to them.

				 ELIJAH
		We're by appointment only.

				 MAN
		I received a card from your
		store.

				 ELIJAH
		Congratulations, you have a
		mailbox... The sale isn't
		for two weeks.

				 MAN
		This one was under the
		windshield of my car.

Elijah turns and faces the customers for the first time. David Dunne stands with
Jeremy.

Elijah just stands staring for the longest time. Beat. He walks closer to them.
When Elijah speaks, his voice has a whispery quality to it.

				 ELIJAH
		You've never been sick?

				 DAVID
		I don't know for sure.
			(beat)
		...I don't think so.

David and Elijah quietly look at each other. Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		Well if this ain't a riddle
		worthy of the Riddler?

								  CUT TO:

EXT. LIMITED EDITION - LATE AFTERNOON

Three chairs have been placed on the walkway in front of the bay window of the
store. The words, "Limited Edition" are etched in the window.

David, Jeremy and Elijah are seated watching the people stroll by. Elijah's cane
is on his lap.

Jeremy sips a drink in a paper cup.

				 ELIJAH
		So let's get some of the
		usual questions out of the
		way. Why am I using a cane?
		Raise your hand if you were
		thinking that.

Jeremy raises his hand.

				 ELIJAH
		I fractured my leg. It's the
		fifth time I've done that
		particular bone. It didn't
		really heal well this time.

				 ELIJAH
		Raise your hand is you're
		wondering who the hell
		breaks the same bone five
		times?

Jeremy and David raise their hands.

				 ELIJAH
		I have something called
		Osteogenesis Imperfecta.
		It's a genetic disorder. I
		don't make this particular
		type of protein very well
		and it makes my bones very
		low in density, very easy to
		break. I've had fifty-four
		breaks in my life. I have
		the tamest version of the
		disorder... Type one.
			(beat)
		There are type two, type
		three, and type four. Type
		four's don't make it very
		long...
			(beat)
		That ends our lecture on the
		medical anomaly known as
		Elijah Price.

Elijah stares at his two rapt listeners.

				 ELIJAH
		How certain are you that you
		haven't been sick in your
		life?

				 DAVID
		Seventy-five percent.

				 ELIJAH
		Seventy-five percent? That's
		not nearly good enough for
		me. I'm extremely skeptical.

				 DAVID
		Skeptical about what?

				 ELIJAH
		Your answer to my question.
		It's one thing to have never
		been injured in your life,
		but to state that you've
		never taken ill, well that's
		a whole new level.

				 JEREMY
		Dad's been injured.

Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		What's he talking about?

				 DAVID
		In college. A car accident.

				 ELIJAH
		Was it serious?

David nods.

				 JEREMY
		He couldn't play football
		anymore.

Beat. Elijah looks shaken.

				 ELIJAH
		I assumed because of the
		train.

				 DAVID
		You assumed wrong.

Elijah closes his eyes. When his eyes open, the life force in them has
diminished. Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		It's over.
			(beat)
		You can go now.

Elijah uses his cane to get up and walk back through the doors of the store.

INT. LIMITED EDITION - LATE AFTERNOON

David and Jeremy enter the store. Elijah leans on a walking stick before one of
the framed sketches. He gazes at it quietly.

				 DAVID
		I think you skipped a couple
		steps.

Elijah turns.

				 DAVID
		You forgot the "Now I'm
		going to tell you what the
		hell is going on" step. See
		usually that comes before
		the, "It's over" Step. And
		it always, always comes
		before the "You can go"
		Step.
			(beat)
		What is over?

				 ELIJAH
		The life of an idea that has
		lived too long in my head.

David stares at Elijah impatiently.

				 ELIJAH
		There are probably only four
		or five individuals in the
		world who can claim more
		knowledge of comics than
		myself. I've spent a third
		of my life in a hospital bed
		with nothing else to do but
		read. I have studied the
		form intimately. I have seen
		the patterns in them... The
		references to social and
		cultural events and the
		atmosphere that surrounded
		them. I've come to believe
		that comics are our last
		link to the ancient way of
		passing on history.

				 ELIJAH
		The Egyptians drew pictures
		on walls about battles, and
		events. Countries all around
		the world still pass on
		knowledge through pictorial
		forms.
			(beat)
		I believe that comics, just
		at their core now... have a
		truth. They are depicting
		what someone, somewhere felt
		or experienced. Then of
		course that core got chewed
		up in the commercial machine
		and gets jazzed up, made
		titillating - cartooned for
		the sale rack.

Elijah gazes at David.

				 ELIJAH
		This city has had its share
		of disasters. Well
		publicized ones. It was
		around the time of that
		plane crash, when it first
		entered my head. And there
		it stayed, as I waited and
		watched the news over the
		years...
			(beat)
		And then one day I see a
		news report on a train
		accident and its sole
		survivor who was
		miraculously unharmed.
			(soft)
		And just like that, an idea
		blossoms into the flower of
		possible reality.

				 DAVID
		What was your idea Elijah?

Beat.

				 ELIJAH(soft)
		If there is someone like me
		in the world, and I'm at one
		end of the spectrum...
		Couldn't there be someone
		the opposite of me, at the
		other end?
			(beat)
		A person who can't be hurt
		like the rest of us. A kind
		of person they were talking
		about in those stories.

Elijah points at the framed comic sketches.

				 ELIJAH(soft)
		A person they believed was
		put here to protect the rest
		of us. Guard us.

				 JEREMY
		You thought my dad was a
		real-

				 DAVID
		Jeremy don't take another
		sip of that drink.

Jeremy looks down at the paper cup in his hands.

				 DAVID
		Throw it in the trashcan
		near the door and wait for
		me outside. Do it now
		please.

David waits for Jeremy to exit the store. Beat.

				 DAVID
		At the church... You were
		following me weren't you?

				 ELIJAH
		Technically no. I gambled
		that you would attend the
		church service. I just
		waited for you.

David glares at Elijah.

				 DAVID
		What's this about? This is
		obviously some scam. Is this
		where you tell me one of
		those pictures is like an
		investment?

				 ELIJAH
		You've misunderstood.

				 DAVID
		I see guys like you all the
		time in my work. You find
		someone you think is
		emotionally vulnerable and
		you tell them a fantastic
		story, utterly convincing...
		and somewhere in there, you
		slip it in... 'I just need
		your credit card number','I
		just need a small down
		payment.'

David shakes his head. He smiles out of frustration. Beat.

				 DAVID
		Did you know that this
		morning was the first
		morning I can remember, that
		I didn't open my eyes and
		feel that sadness... Do you
		know what I'm talking about?
		That little bit of sadness?
			(beat)
		I thought the person that
		wrote that note had an
		answer for me. For why I
		survived that train. For why
		my life feels so out of
		balance...
			(beat)
		But I guess that's what you
		were counting on.

Elijah stares carefully at David. Beat. David glances over to the entrance.
Jeremy watched through the window concerned.

				 DAVID
		I'm going to leave now.
			(beat)
		Good luck with your sale.

Elijah watches David walk towards the front door.

				 ELIJAH
		What type of job do you have
		David?

David opens the door. He looks back at Elijah.

				 ELIJAH
		You mentioned you've met
		'guys like me' in your work.
			(beat)
		What type of job would that
		be?

Beat.

				 DAVID
		I work at the stadium as a
		security guard.

Beat. David closes the door behind him. Elijah watches through the window as
Jeremy takes David's hand as they cross the street.

Elijah gazes out the window in a bit of a daze.

								  CUT TO:

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

ALL LIGHTS ARE OUT EXCEPT THE SMALL BEDSIDE LAMP ON DAVID'S SIDE.

David sits up in bed staring at a torn section of newspaper in his hands.

Jeremy is asleep horizontally with his legs over David's legs.

David doesn't blink as he gazes at the headline silently...

  "TRAIN CRASH DEATH TOLL CONFIRMED AT 131 DEAD. 1 SURVIVOR"

Beat. David slides out from under his son's legs. Jeremy stirs but doesn't wake
up.

David moves to the darkness of the corner of the room. He opens a closet door.

A NAKED HANGING BULB GOES ON as David yanks a chain. David steps inside the
narrow closet and closes the door slightly so the LIGHT FROM THE BULB DOESN'T
FALL ON JEREMY.

There's just enough room to stand and look around. David reaches up and pulls a
small travel bag out of the way. David stretches as he feels on the top shelf.

His hand comes down with something wrapped in a t-shirt. He unwraps it. It's a
handgun.

He stares at it for a beat before wrapping it back up and replacing it to the
highest shelf.

He stretches even more. Reaches farther back. WE HEAR SOMETHING SLIDE ON THE
SHELF AS HE PULLS IT FORWARD.

He pulls down a folder jammed with clippings. He opens the folder to reveal a
young David in football uniform holding his helmet in the air victoriously. The
word "Champion" is written over his head. David flips through the top clippings
- all are images and stories of David and football.

He turns the pile over. Goes to the last clipping. This piece of paper is folded
over three times, unlike the others. He opens it.

It's a newspaper headline. It reads...

"CAR ACCIDENT LEAVES TWO INJURED"

David puts the new headline next to the old one... They look like a set. Even the
font is similar.

David stares at the old headline. Stares hard at the photo of the bent and
heavily damaged car laying upside down in the middle of the highway... The bulb
seems to flicker. David is utterly still.

SOMEONE KNOCKS AT THE BEDROOM DOOR. David gets startled.

He puts back the clippings. Stuffing the new one inside with them. He replaces it
back to the top shelf and leaves the closet.

ANOTHER SOFT SET OF KNOCKS as David moves across the bedroom. He opens the door.

Megan stands in the darkened hall. Beat.

				 DAVID(whisper)
		Hi.

Megan nods. Beat.

				 MEGAN(whisper)
		I've come to a decision.

				 DAVID(whisper)
		Oh.

Beat.

				 MEGAN(whisper)
		Let me just ask you
		something okay? And you can
		be totally honest. I'm
		prepared for any answer. It
		won't affect me...

David nods, "yes."

				 MEGAN(whisper)
		Have you been with anyone?
		Since we started having
		problems? The answer won't
		affect me.

Beat. David stares at his wife.

				 MEGAN(whisper)
		It won't affect me either
		way.

Beat. David doesn't say anything. He just nods, "No."

Megan's face starts to tremble. She starts crying. Tears roll over her very
affected face. She tries to wipe them away, but there's too many. Beat.

				 MEGAN(soft)
		...My decision is... I'd
		like to start again. Pretend
		we're at the beginning.
			(beat)
		It's a big deal you walked
		away from that train. It's
		a second chance.
			(beat)
		If you want to ask me out
		sometime, that would be
		okay.

Megan nods and walks down the stairs as she wipes her face. David watches her
disappear into the shadows.

						DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  VETERAN'S STADIUM - AFTERNOON

Sunday afternoon. The cavernous stadium opens up into a picture perfect blue sky.
The Philadelphia Eagles pro football players are in uniform and doing stretches
on the field. The opposing team warms up on the other end of the field.

The sixty thousand seats are already half filled as fans stream in on every level
of the stadium.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. ENTRANCE GATE 27B - AFTERNOON

A line of ticket holders snakes towards two turnstiles where stadium crew are
ripping tickets.

David Dunne stands to one side with two other security guards.

The fans moving through the turnstiles are clad in all types of Eagles
paraphernalia. A group of girls carries a homemade banner that David reads as he
tilts his head sideways. "We sleep with quarterbacks," is written in block
letters.

David stares at a woman carrying a newborn infant in her arms. The baby is
wearing an eagles uniform.

The WALKIE TALKIE on David's hip bursts to life. He pulls it off his hip an
listens.

				 WALKIE
		Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got
		a guy at gate 17C with a
		bogus ticket. Says he knows
		you. He won't tell me his
		name.

				 DAVID(into walkie)
		What's he look like?

				 WALKIE
		He's got the most beautiful
		eyes... The hell kind of
		question is that? He's a
		guy.

				 DAVID(into walkie)
		Send him packing. I'm not
		walking all the way over
		there.

				 WALKIE
		Consider him packed. I
		didn't like his attitude...
		Struttin around with a cane
		and shit.

Beat.

				 DAVID(into walkie)
		Hold up Jenkins...

								  CUT TO:

EXT. ENTRANCE GATE 17C - AFTERNOON

David finds Elijah waiting to the side as the crowds funnel through the gate.
Elijah offers his hand as he walks up. David doesn't take it.

				 ELIJAH
		They said I couldn't get in
		with my ticket.

Elijah offers him the ticket. David inspects it.

				 DAVID
		It's for last week's game.

				 ELIJAH
		I've come to understand
		that...
			(beat)
		An ill advised purchase in
		the parking lot.

David hands Elijah back the ticket.

				 DAVID
		What do you want?

				 ELIJAH
		Not money.
			(beat)
		But I appreciate your
		healthy cynicism in the
		manner. It will be wise for
		both of us to proceed with
		greatest caution.

				 DAVID
		We're not proceeding
		anywhere together.

				 ELIJAH
		We've already begun.

David looks around.

				 DAVID
		One more time. What is it
		you want?

Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		Why is it, do you think,
		that of all the professions
		in the world... you chose
		protection?

				 DAVID
		Are you for real?

				 ELIJAH
		You could have poured coffee
		in Starbucks, you could have
		learned to install track
		lighting in office
		buildings, you could have
		told people their horoscopes
		on the internet... You could
		have been one of ten
		thousand things... but in
		the end, you chose to
		protect people. You made
		that decision... and I find
		that very, very interesting.
			(beat)
		Now all I need is your
		credit card number.

Beat. Elijah smiles.

				 ELIJAH
		That last part was a joke.

David fights it. But he smiles anyway. Beat.

				 DAVID
		I got this job because my
		college coach called the guy
		who manages the stadium.
		There's no hidden meaning to
		it.

David's walkie makes NOIES on his hip.

				 DAVID
		They need me at the gate.

David stares at Elijah leaning on his walking stick.

				 DAVID
		Did you really want to see
		the game? I can get you in.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. ENTRANCE GATE 27B - AFTERNOON

The line of fans outside the gate has tripled in size and intensity.

David and Elijah move along the line towards the turnstiles.

				 DAVID
		It gets heaviest ten minutes
		before kickoff.

David bumps a guy in line wearing an army jacket. David looks backs at him and
continues walking.

David moves to a security guard near the turnstiles.

				 DAVID
		Why don't we pat down?

David walks to his post near the gate and faces the crowd. Elijah moves next to
him.

				 DAVID
		Just give me a minute.

				 ELIJAH
		Is there a problem?

				 DAVID
		That guy in green. Sometimes
		people carry weapons in
		here. Then they drink too
		much. They're team isn't
		doing so well, bad things
		happen... We do random pat
		downs of the crowd to
		discourage people from
		carrying.
			(beat)
		If he's carrying, he'll step
		out of line.

Elijah observes as a security team pats down random males as they move through
the turnstiles.

The GREEN ARMY JACKETED MAN moves forward in the line. His face is blank as he
watches the pat down ahead of him. He's twenty people from the turnsstile.

David eyes him. Fifteen people away... Ten...

The man coughs and steps out of the line. Elijah watches the green army jacket
melt into the thick part of the crowd and disappear as it moves away from the
stadium.

								  CUT TO:

INT. STADIUM TUNNEL - AFTERNOON

AN UNLIT arched concrete passageway. The SUNLIGHT from the stadium streams in
causing long shadows.

Elijah stands waiting in the ground tunnel by himself.

THE THUNDEROUS CHEERS OF THE SIXTY THOUSAND FANS IN THE STADIUM ECHOES FROM THE
FIELD INTO THE TUNNEL.

David enters the tunnel and joins Elijah. He hands him a ticket.

				 DAVID
		I got you a seat in the
		seven hundred level.
			(points straight up)
		It's nose-bleed territory,
		but at least you won't get
		spit on.

				 ELIJAH
		How did you know that man
		you bumped was carrying a
		weapon?

				 DAVID
		Probably the army jacket.
		Those guys carry hunting
		knives and stuff for show.

				 ELIJAH
		You thought he was carrying
		a knife?

Beat.

				 DAVID
		I thought he was carrying
		something.

				 ELIJAH
		But not a knife?

				 DAVID
		I got this picture of a
		silver handled gun tucked in
		his pants.
			(beat)
		Like on t.v.

Elijah stares at David. THE STADIUM CHEERS BOUNCE OFF THE GRAY WALLS.

				 ELIJAH
		You have good instincts when
		it comes to things like
		that?

				 DAVID
		Like what?

				 ELIJAH
		Telling when people have
		done something wrong?

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Yes.

				 ELIJAH
		Have you ever tried to
		develop it?

				 DAVID
		I don't know what you're
		asking?

				 ELIJAH
		You're skill.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Listen. I got to be on the
		sidelines during the game...
		You can get to your seat by
		taking the stairwell at-

				 ELIJAH
		Characters in comic books
		are often attributed special
		powers. X-ray vision, things
		of that sort.

David exhales slowly as he stares at Elijah.

				 DAVID
		Okay, I don't want to play
		this game anymore.

				 ELIJAH
		It's an exaggeration of the
		truth. Maybe it's based on
		something as simple as
		instinct. Like being able to
		touch someone and tell
		whether they've done
		something wrong... Or the
		level of what they've done
		wrong.

				 DAVID
		The guy might not have been
		carrying anything.

				 ELIJAH
		Or he might have been
		carrying a silver handled
		gun tucked in his pants.

David's WALKIE ERUPTS WITH NOISE.

				 DAVID
		I have to go now.

				 ELIJAH
		One last question.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Quick.

				 ELIJAH
		The car accident you were
		in... Was there anyone else
		involved?

The two men stand very still in the tunnel.

				 DAVID
		Yes. My wife Megan. She was
		in the car with me.

David turns and starts down the hall. David talks back over his shoulder.

				 DAVID
		Have a good life Elijah and
		try to buy your tickets at
		an authorized sales
		location.

Elijah watches as the silhouetted figure of David Dunne jogs down the darkness of
the tunnel.

INT. CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

We are inside a customized car. The dashboard is covered in some sort of thin
foam padding. The steering wheel and gear shift have the same padding. Every
corner and hard surface has been safe guarded. Elijah sits behind the wheel of
his car in the parking lot of the stadium. He sits as thoughts crash at his head.
Beat.

He finally reaches for the keys and starts up the car. He looks into the rearview
mirror and sees the man in the GREEN ARMY JACKET pass behind his car.

Elijah quickly turns and sees the man moving through the parked cars heading out
of the parking lot.

Elijah takes a deep breath and turns off the engine.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON

Elijah's walking stick makes RHYTHMIC CLICKS on the concrete parking lot.

The figure in the army jacket seems to move farther away with every step.

Elijah starts breathing harder. He pushes himself to move faster. He avoids the
hard chrome bumpers and tailpipes that jut out from the cars as he quickens his
pace through the lot.

He gains on the army jacket.

				 ELIJAH(calls out)
		Hold up for a second!

The man in the army jacket turns as he reaches a subway entrance that marks the
end of the parking lot. He looks back at Elijah for a beat. Doesn't like what he
sees. He disappears into the subway entrance.

Elijah quickens into a jog now. He hasn't done this in a while and it's painful.
He makes it with great strain to the subway.

He looks into the entrance...

A steep flight of stairs leads to the subway floor. The tail of the army jacket
is glimpsed before it disappears.

Elijah breathes hard as he takes hold of the railing.

				 ELIJAH(calls out)
		I just want to ask you
		something!

Elijah's VOICE ECHOES down the stairs. No response.

Elijah starts his descent.

THE SOUND OF A SUBWAY PULLING IN ROARS UP THE STAIRS.

Elijah has to move fast. He takes the steps with less and less hesitation. He's
moving with great agility... and then his foot catches on a step.

His hand slips away from the railing...

He falls down the remaining part of the stairs. The FIRST SICKENING CRACK is
heard when his hand reaches out to stop his fall.

The SECOND CRACK IS MORE LIKE A CRUNCH AS HIS LEG LANDS AWKWARDLY ON THE METAL
STAIRS.

He comes to a stop in a pile on the dirty gum stained floor of the subway
landing. His jaw is locked in a HORRIFIC SCREAM THAT GETS EATEN BY THE ROAR OF
THE SUBWAY TRAIN PULLING IN.

His contorted anguished face sees the turnstiles of the subway upside down. The
green army jacketed man looks back at Elijah with a blank expression pushing
through the turnstile.

The last thing Elijah sees before he blacks out, is the tail of the man's coat
riding up as he move through the turnstile. The SILVER HANDLE OF A GUN peeks out
from the belt of his pants.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. BUS STOP - DUSK

David's neighborhood turns crimson as the day comes to an end. The Septa bus
pulls to a stop in front of a public high school. David steps off, still in his
security clothes. The bus pulls away as he hears his SON'S VOICE.

David turns to the high school football field behind him. A group of children are
having a touch football game. Jeremy runs out from the huddle across the field to
David.

				 JEREMY
		Was it sold out?

David nods, "No."

				 DAVID
		You know how mad your mom
		would be if she knew you
		were playing football?

Jeremy nods.

				 JEREMY
		Are you going to tell?

David nods, "No."

				 JEREMY
		You want yo play the last
		downs? We got a big guy like
		you. You can play on
		opposite sides.

David looks to the fields to see a very muscular college age man in sweats who
stands with the other children.

				 JEREMY
		He's Potter's cousin. He's
		the starting corner back for
		Temple University.

David stares at his son.

				 JEREMY
		He going pro in the draft.
		They say he can run the
		fifty-

				 DAVID
		In under six seconds.
			(beat)
		I've heard.

David watches the cornerback being surrounded by kids. He's letting a couple of
the kids feel his flexed bicep.

				 DAVID
		I'm going to go in.

				 JEREMY
		Just play one set of downs.
		I told them you were great.

				 DAVID
		Why'd you do that?

				 JEREMY
		Just one-

				 DAVID
		Jeremy.
			(beat)
		I'm going in. I have to do
		some things.

				 JEREMY
		What things?

				 DAVID
		I'm going to work out.

				 JEREMY
		I'll help you.

				 DAVID
		There's nothing to do.

Jeremy turns back to the children and waves.

				 JEREMY(yells)
		I can't play! I'm working
		out with my dad!

Jeremy turns back to his father and takes his hand. David looks down at his son
who waits patiently.

								  CUT TO:

INT. BASEMENT - EARLY EVENING

The basement is dominated by storage boxes and Christmas decorations. An old
bench press and weights are in a cluttered corner.

David sits and turns at the end of the bench as Jeremy laboriously carries and
places fifteen a pound weight on the bar. David talks over his shoulder.

				 DAVID
		Why don't you rest now? I'll
		take it from here. You've
		been a big help.

Jeremy goes to the opposite side of the bar and starts to put on another weight.

				 JEREMY
		You think you could beat up
		Mike Tyson? I mean before he
		started wiggin out and
		eating people's ears?

				 DAVID
		No.

				 JEREMY
		What if you worked out
		everyday for six months? You
		think you could beat him
		then?

				 DAVID
		No.

				 JEREMY
		What if you only ate foods
		that were good for you and
		you worked out everyday for
		a year?

Jeremy is breathing hard as he puts the safety collars on the barbell and comes
around to David's end of the bench. David lays back.

				 DAVID
		No.

David takes hold of the barbell. Beat. He takes a deep breath.

The weight comes off the armrests of the bench. David lowers it to his chest and
pushes it back up. He does just one more rep with serious strain. He puts the
weight back on the armrest and sits up.

				 DAVID
		How much did you put on
		there?

David twists around and looks back at the barbell. He counts up the black metal
circles. He turns back to Jeremy.

				 DAVID
		You put too much. That's two
		hundred and fifty pounds.

				 JEREMY
		How much can you lift?

David looks back at the weights.

				 DAVID
		That's the most I've ever
		lifted.
			(beat)
		That could have been
		dangerous Jeremy. Why don't
		you go upstairs and let me
		finish up?

Jeremy starts back to the barbell.

				 JEREMY
		I'll take it off. I'll help
		you right.

He slips off the safety collar.

				 JEREMY
		You think you could have
		beaten up Bruce Lee?

David hears the SOUND OF THE WEIGHTS SLIDING OFF THE BAR BEHIND HIM.

				 DAVID
		No.

				 JEREMY
		I mean if you knew karate?

				 DAVID
		No Jeremy.

				 JEREMY
		What if he wasn't aloud to
		kick and you were really mad
		at him?

Jeremy is breathing hard again as he finishes with the weights and comes around
to David.

David lays back.

				 DAVID
		No.

David takes hold of the bar. Lifts it off the armrest. Brings it down. His arms
are straining hard again. He raises it and lowers it two time; it takes a sizable
effort. The weights bang down onto the armrest.

David sits up.

				 DAVID
		How much did you take off?

				 JEREMY
		I lied.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		You added?

Jeremy nods, "Yes" slowly.

David turns completely around and looks at the barbell. He counts the black discs
on the steel bar. Beat.

Nobody says anything for a long time.

				 JEREMY(soft)
		How much is it?

				 DAVID(soft)
		Two hundred and seventy.

David just stares at the black steel circles on the metal bar. Jeremy comes and
sits on the bench next to his father. They both stare at the weight. Beat.

				 JEREMY(dead serious)
		Let's put more.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Okay.

								  CUT TO:

INT. BASEMENT - EARLY EVENING

David's fingers wrap around the cold metal of the bar. He leans his head forward
and looks to Jeremy.

				 DAVID
		Why don't you move back a
		bit? Just to be safe.

Jeremy moves back to the bottom of the stairs leading up to the house. He waits.

Another deep breath as David heaves. The weight CLINKS as it comes off the arm
rest. David is full out straining now as he lowers and raises it. His arms begin
to tremble as he lifts it for the second time. BANG the weight lands back safely
onto the rest.

David sits up. He looks at his son whose eyes are wide. Beat.

				 JEREMY
		More?

Beat. David nods, "Yes."

								  CUT TO:

INT. BASEMENT - EARLY EVENING

An enormous amount of black discs sits on the bar. David's hands are gripping the
metal.

He talks to Jeremy who stands in his position at the bottom of the stairs without
looking at him.

				 DAVID
		You should never try
		anything like this. You know
		that right?

Jeremy nods, "Yes."

				 DAVID
		What do you do if something
		happens?

				 JEREMY(soft)
		Get mom.

David nods, "yes" before starting his deep breathing. He takes one last breath.
CLINK the weights comes off the rest. His arms are trembling immediately now. His
face is locked in a grimace as he brings the bar down to his chest and back up
again two times before dropping it onto the armrest.

He slowly sits up.

				 DAVID
		How many did you put on that
		time?

				 JEREMY(soft)
		All of it.

				 DAVID
		There's no more left?

Jeremy nods, "no" in a slight daze. Beat. David looks around his basement.

				 DAVID
		What else can we use?

								  CUT TO:

INT. BASEMENT - EARLY EVENING

A set of two unopened MAB satin finish paint cans are dangling by their metal
handles on the outside of each side of the weights.

The fours cans sway a little as the bar is heaved off of David's chest. His arms
are shaking hard. He raises the weight to it's apex and brings it down again. It
touches his chest and rises up again. David's red strained face exhales
powerfully as he straightens his arms.

The bar lands on the armrest with A CRASH. The paint cans make METAL SQUEAKS as
they swing to stillness, one at a time. Beat.

David sits up and turns back to the weights. His mouth moves as he calculates the
discs and the cans.

His lips stop moving. Beat.

				 JEREMY(soft)
		How much is it?

David doesn't react.

				 JEREMY(soft)
		How much is it dad?

It takes a second for David to register the question. He looks to his son. Beat.

				 DAVID(soft)
		About three hundred and
		forty.

David turns and looks at his son. Jeremy's mouth is slightly open. He gazes at
his dad. Awe in his tiny eyes.

								  CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - EVENING

David sits on the edge of the bathroom tub. He's just showered and wearing jeans
and a t-shirt. He sits still with his elbows resting on his knees, staring at the
white tiles of the floor.

THE PHONE RINGS.

David gets up and walks out of the bathroom. He picks up the phone and stands in
the bathroom doorway.

				 DAVID
		Yeah, hello.

				 WOMAN(on phone)
		Is David Dunne there?

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Megan?

				 MEGAN(on phone)
		Yes. Is this David?

				 DAVID
		Yeah? Megan where are you
		calling from?

				 MEGAN(on phone)
		My name is Megan Inverso. We
		went to college together.

David looks at the phone. The lights for line ONE and line TWO are glowing RED.
David squints his eyes as he pieces together the situation. Beat.

He moves back into the bathroom. The cord stretches as he takes his seat on the
edge of the bathtub.

				 DAVID
		I remember you.

				 MEGAN(on phone)
		I was hoping you would call
		me, but... Anyway I decided
		not to wait.
			(beat)
		I was thinking, it might be
		nice to go to dinner
		together.

Beat.

				 MEGAN(soft)
		...Hello?

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Yeah it might be nice.

We hear A SOUND ON THE OTHER END OF THE PHONE. A SOUND MUCH LIKE AN EXHALE.

								  CUT TO:

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - LATE EVENING

The local Chinese restaurant. Red and gold plastic dragons hang from the ceiling.
A couple late-nighters are at the bar. Megan and David are two of a handful of
people left dining in the restaurant. They're a little dressed up. Megan looks
kind of stunning.

				 DAVID
		...When you work with
		clients on machines, do they
		sometimes just jump up a
		level or two? Do something
		they didn't know they were
		capable of?

				 MEGAN
		Not often, but it is
		possible. Most people get
		scared when they see the
		shadow of their limits. They
		don't know how long the
		shadow really is. They don't
		know how far away the real
		limits are standing... They
		stop out of fear.

David nods as he takes it in. Beat. He looks down at his plate and twirls his lo
mein onto a fork. Megan watches him.

				 MEGAN
		This is kind of strange
		isn't it?

David nods, "yes" before taking the bite.

				 MEGAN
		We're not even acting like
		ourselves.

David touches his mouth with his napkin.

				 MEGAN
		Like that. Your mouth's
		dirty. You tapped your
		napkin to your lips. You
		only do that when you're
		with someone you don't know.

David looks down at his napkin.

				 DAVID
		What do I do when I'm around
		someone I know?

				 MEGAN
		You use your sleeve.

They both smile at each other. Beat.

				 WOMAN(o.s.)
		Megan?

David and Megan look over to the only other table of late night diners as they
get up from their table. A woman about Megan's age walks over to her.

				 WOMAN
		I thought it was you.

				 MEGAN
		Hi.
			 (to David)
		This is Claire. Her son is
		in Jeremy's class. Claire
		and I worked on the school
		food drive together.

				 DAVID
		Hello.

CLAIRE smiles as she stares at David. She turns to Megan.

				 CLAIRE(mouths)
		He's cute.

Claire turns back to David.

				 CLAIRE
		I'm very happy about this.
		Megan mentioned to me she
		was considering dating
		again.

Megan becomes still.

				 CLAIRE(to David)
		I'm sorry, what's your name?

Beat. David doesn't look up.

				 DAVID
		David.

				 CLAIRE
		David?

				 MEGAN
		This is my husband.

Beat. All three people become frozen in silence.

Claire looks to Megan.

				 CLAIRE(soft)
		I am so sorry.

Megan nods.

Claire quietly walks away form the table and joins her group as they leave the
restaurant. Beat.

Megan and David are the last one's left. They sit silently in their booth. Megan
looks at David's face. He's shaken.

He slowly takes a sip of water and then taps his mouth with napkin.

								  CUT TO:

INT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

It's late. NO LIGHTS ARE ON EXCEPT THE ONE IN THE HALL. The babysitter has black
dyes hair and Buddy Holly glasses. David waits as she puts on her jacket.

				 DYED HAIR GIRL
		He ate about six of those
		chocolate covered doughnut
		holes with his milk. He said
		he only had three, but I
		know he had six.

				 DAVID
		Okay.

David is not paying attention to the girl. He watches as his wife takes off her
coat and heads to the guest room. She turns before entering the room. David and
his wife make eye contact.

				 MEGAN(soft)
		Goodnight.

David nods. Megan goes into her room. The guest door closes softly.

David finds the babysitter looking at him with an odd expression.

				 DYED HAIR GIRL
		My parents sleep in separate
		beds.

David reaches into his wallet and hands the girl money.

				 DAVID
		Thank you.

David opens the front door for her.

				 DYED HAIR GIRL
		By the way, Jeremy went to
		sleep in his room tonight.

				 DAVID
		His room?

The baby sitter nods with a smile as she walks out the front door.

								  CUT TO:

INT. JEREMY'S BEDROOM

David walks into the darkened child's bedroom. The lump on the bed turns when he
hears movement. He smiles when he sees David.

				 JEREMY(whispered)
		I'm sleeping in my room.

				 DAVID(soft)
		I see.

				 JEREMY(whispered)
		I'm not scared.

				 DAVID(soft)
		That's great.

				 JEREMY(whispered)
		Do you know why?

David nods, "No."

				 JEREMY(whispered)
		I know now.

				 DAVID(soft)
		Know what?

				 JEREMY(whispered)
		You're secret identity.
			(beat)
		That man was right.

Beat. David just stares at his son. Jeremy's eyes start to close.

				 DAVID
		Jeremy.

Jeremy opens his eyes.

				 DAVID(soft)
		There are big guys in almost
		every gym who can lift that
		much.

Beat. Jeremy's eyes start to shut.

				 JEREMY(whispered)
		You could have lifted more.
			 (his eyes close)
		...Don't worry, I won't tell
		anyone.

Jeremy Dunne falls asleep. David Dunne stands in the darkness of his son's room.
Posters of comic book heroes don the walls around him.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Elijah's cheek rests against two pristine white pillows. He looks exhausted. His
eyes are fixed on some abstract point in the room. WE HEAR SOUNDS OF A HOSPITAL.

The torso of a PHYSICIAN can be seen on the other side of the bed. We hear him
speak but never see his face.

				 PHYSICIAN(o.s.)
		...fracture of the proximal
		phalanx of the little finger
		as well as multiple
		fractures of the sixth,
		seventh, and eighth ribs.
		The worst of the injury,
		however, was sustained to

		were fourteen breaks. It
		simply shattered...

				 ELIJAH
		They call me Mr. Glass.

Beat.

				 PHYSICIAN(o.s.)
		Who does?

				 ELIJAH
		Kids.

Elijah just keeps staring.

				 PHYSICIAN(o.s.)
		Shall I continue?

Beat. Elijah's head nods the slightest bit up and down.

				 PHYSICIAN(o.s.)
		Pins were placed throughout
		the length of the leg. The
		use of a wheelchair will be
		needed for a two month
		period. The use of crutches
		will follow for twelve to
		fourteen months. Hospital
		stay will range from five to

		to twelve months of physical

The PHYSICIAN'S WORDS FADE AWAY as Elijah continues to gaze at an abstract point
in the room.

								FADE TO BLACK:

INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER - LATE MORNING

WE EMERGE FROM DARKNESS TO FIND OURSELVES IN THE PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER.

A CO-WORKER finds Megan working with an elderly gentleman who's laboring on a
stationary bike.

				 JANIS
		Your ten o'clock is here.
		The hospital discharged him
		this morning.

				 MEGAN
		Thanks.

The co-worker takes Megan's position by the elderly man.

Megan crosses the physical therapy center. A man in a wheel chair waits by her
office. She walks up to him with a smile.

				 MEGAN
		Elijah right?

Elijah's leg is immobilized by a metal brace and held straight. Under his shirt
we see the wrappings around his ribs. His left pinky is in a splint. He smiles
and nods, "yes" to Megan.

								  CUT TO:

INT. STADIUM LOCKER ROOM - LATE MORNING

David Dunne stands in security uniform by a set of double doors that leads into
the players locker room.

Three walls of the locker room are lined with shiny lockers. One side of the room
has benches and massage tables. The far end of the room has work out equipment.

About twenty players and trainers are scattered throughout the spacious room lost
in their own pre-game rituals.

David watches as a massive muscular player takes a seat on the massage table and
removes his dress shirt. His body is covered in old bruises. He lays down,
wincing a bit from the pain. A trainer begins to massage him.

David just stares at the battered athlete. His gaze moves across the room. Beat.

David stares at something in the crowded room then he starts towards it.

He moves through the room of players and trainers. He moves to the one area of
the large room not occupied by anyone.

David comes to a step at the foot of an Olympic bench press. Racks and racks of
free weights sit behind the press.

David looks down at the thick silver bar. Three large black plates are on either
side. Six in all.

David looks back and glances at the double doors where he should be standing.
Beat. He looks to the twenty or so players and trainers in the room. Some of the
players have headphones on. Some are staring into space. A couple are on cell
phones...

No one notices David Dunne as he reaches for a forty-five pound black plate off
the weight rack.

The huge disc slides onto the bar with almost NO SOUND...

A matching forty-five pound disc goes on the other side...

And then David adds another. He matches it on the other side...

THE BENCH CREAKS just the slightest bit as David takes a seat.

No one notices the security guard lay back on the bench.

David's hands take hold of the shiny bar.

He closes his eyes...

David's arms become tense. He pushes against the weight. It doesn't move.

His face turns deep red. He opens his eyes and stares at the bar as he keeps
training. His face and arms are shaking... He keeps staring... focusing.

And then, without any fanfare, the bar lifts off the arm rest.

The weight hovers over David. He lowers it to his chest for a second time. His
arms aren't shaking anymore. He pushes the weights back up.

He carefully brings the bar back to the arm rest. It touches down with the
smallest of CLINKS.

David's fingers uncurl from the bar.

David lets out two slow soft breaths as he counts the thick black discs.

				 DAVID(whispers)
		Four ten... four
		forty-five...
			(beat)
		Five hundred.

Beat. David sits up in a daze.

He finds the entire room of athletes and trainers staring at him. Some of the
players have stood up. Everyone stares as David Dunne with the same quiet
disbelief in their eyes.

								  CUT TO:

INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER - AFTERNOON

Megan and Elijah are in the far corner of the room. They're separated from the
other clients. Megan is seated on an exercise machine. Elijah is in his wheel
chair facing her.

				 MEGAN
		We're going to prevent any
		substantial atrophy of your
		good leg with this.
			(She taps the machine)
		It works the quadriceps.

				 ELIJAH
		How long have you been
		married?

Megan is taken off guard by the question. She stares at Elijah. Beat.

				 MEGAN
		Twelve years.

				 ELIJAH
		How did you get together?

Elijah smiles warmly. Megan smiles softly back.

				 MEGAN
		A car accident.

Elijah smiles even bigger.

				 ELIJAH
		Now you're going to have to
		tell me more.

				 MEGAN
		...See my husband was a big
		football star in college and
		we were in an accident
		together. Our car flipped on
		an icy road. We were both
		injured. He couldn't play
		football anymore.
			(beat)
		If that hadn't happened, we
		wouldn't have been together.

				 ELIJAH
		How so?

				 MEGAN
		Football wasn't the kind of
		life I wanted... For ten
		years I'd be by the phone
		waiting for a call telling
		me he broke his neck in a
		practice game. And if it
		wasn't that call, it would
		be a call telling me he blew
		out his knee or suffered his
		third concussion. I've seen
		way too much of it in my
		job... I can barely take it
		when my clients are in pain.
			(beat)
		I don't hate the game. I
		admire the amount of skill
		it involved and, like
		everyone else, I was in awe
		of how he could play it, but
		I couldn't give him my heart
		and then have something
		happen to him. And it always
		does with that game.
			(beat)
		It's not a thing many people
		would understand.

				 ELIJAH
		You and my mother would have
		a special connection.

				 MEGAN
		Any way, fate stepped in and
		took football out of the
		equation.

				 ELIJAH
		...And everyone lived
		happily ever after.

Beat.

				 MEGAN
		Sort of.

Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		What part of David's body
		was injured?

Beat. Megan's eyes become utterly still.

				 MEGAN
		Who said my husband's name
		is David?

INT. STADIUM - AFTERNOON

Eleven football players in white and green battle eleven football players in blue
and gray on the field. A sold out stadium watches the event.

David stands at the lip of a tunnel that opens out onto the upper section of the
second level. Waves of people move from their seats through the tunnel to the
bathrooms and concession stands and back again.

David stares to the side away from the movement, his shoulder leaned up against
the wall. He looks over at the constant movement of spectators through the
tunnel.

Beat. His shoulder leaves the wall. He STEPS OUT into the stream of people.
Shoulders and arms bump into him and brush by him as they move.

David's eyes are looking down - his expression still - like he's listening.

He continues into the dead center of the tunnel. He's in the heaviest part of the
movement now. Fans continue to brush against him as they pass.

And then it happens... A stocky woman bumps into him.

FLASH CUT: AN IMAGE OF THE STOCKY WOMAN IN A BATHROBE STANDING IN A KITCHEN.
SHE'S HOLDING THE SHOULDER OF A FIVE YEAR OLD BOY STANDING NEXT TO HER. HE'S
CRYING UNCONTROLLABLY.

THEY BOTH ARE LOOKING DOWN AT THE KITCHEN TABLE WHERE THREE THINGS ARE LAID
OUT... A BELT, A HANGER, AND AN EXTENSION CORD.

				 STOCKY WOMAN
		Choose.

SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

We're back with David in the crowd. He turns and watches the stocky woman walk
down the tunnel. She's holding the wrist of her five year old son. She yanks it
quickly and violently to keep the boy close at her side. She and the boy dissolve
into the crowd.

INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER - AFTERNOON

Elijah and Megan sit very still.

				 ELIJAH
		There have been three major
		disasters in this city over
		the last four years. I've
		followed each one of them...
		A Seven-three-seven crashes
		on take off. One hundred and
		seventy-two die. No
		survivors... A hotel fire
		downtown. Two hundred and
		eleven die. No survivors...
		And am Amtrak train derails
		seven and half miles outside
		of the city. One hundred and
		thirty one die. One
		survivor. He is unharmed.
			(beat)
		I've spoken with your
		husband about his survival.
		I suggested a rather
		unbelievable explanation.
		Since then, I've come to
		believe, that my
		explanation, however
		unbelievable, is in fact,
		true.

				 MEGAN
		And what was that
		explanation?

Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		It's a mediocre time Mrs.
		Dunne. People are starting
		to lose hope. It's hard for
		many to believe that
		extraordinary things live
		inside themselves as well as
		others... I hope you can
		keep an open mind?

Beat.

				 MEGAN(soft)
		Is this a religious thing?

				 ELIJAH
		I own a comic book museum.
		It's called the Limited
		Edition.

				 MEGAN(smiles)
		For a second there I thought
		you were a fanatic.

				 ELIJAH
		I believe comic books are
		based loosely on reality -
		I believe there are real
		life equivalents of the
		heroes in those books that
		walk the earth - I believe
		your husband is one of those
		individuals.

Beat. Megan becomes utterly still.

				 ELIJAH
		I'm glad you brought up fate
		Mrs. Dunne. I'm becoming a
		strong believer in it...
		See, David refuses to speak
		with me any longer... And
		when I saw your name on my
		insurance list of approved
		physical therapists... It
		was like fate had
		intervened...
			(beat)
		We were meant to speak to

INT. STADIUM - AFTERNOON

David lets the waves of people move by him in the tunnel.

A MAN WITH GRAY EYES and wearing a dark blue sweat shirt carries a cardboard tray
of nachos and drinks. He brushes David's arm as he passes.

FLASH CUT: THE IMAGE OF THE GREY EYED MAN WEARING A BLOOD SPLATTERED T-SHIRT IN
A MEN'S BATHROOM. HE'S VIOLENTLY KICKING ANOTHER MAN CURLED UP ON THE FLOOR OF A
TOILET STALL.

HE STOPS KICKING. HE GLARES DOWN WITH POWERFUL GRAY EYES.

				 SWEAT SHIRT MAN(whispers)
		This is my house, bitch.
		These are my customers.

SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

The gray eyes man in the blue sweat shirt pauses with nachos in hand at the top
of the stairs to locate his seats. Beat.

David walks the five feet between them and taps him on the shoulder. People
continue to stream by as the man turns to face David. The man's GRAY EYES go from
David's face to the security emblem on his shirt. The man's face becomes still.

				 GRAY EYED MAN
		Yeah?

David stares hard at the man in front of him.

				 DAVID
		We've had some problems with
		drug selling in this
		stadium.
			(beat)
		Would you mind if I checked
		the pockets of your
		sweatshirt?

The gray eyed man stands eerily still with his nachos and drinks. The two men
just stare at each other, evaluating the situation. People move in both
directions around them, unaware.

The gray eyes man holds his tray of food to the side and raises his arms slowly.

David steps forward and reaches into his pockets. Beat. David pulls his hands out
from the pockets. They're empty.

The gray eyes man brings his arms down. Beat.

The walkie on David's hip COMES TO LIFE. David reaches down and pulls it off his
belt without removing his eyes from the man in front of him. David brings the
walkie to his mouth.

				 DAVID(into walkie)
		Yeah?

				 WALKIE(o.s.)
		There's a message for you at
		the office. Your kid was
		hurt.

David's face changes.

				 DAVID(into walkie)
		When?

				 WALKIE(o.s.)
		Just now. They want you to
		come down to his school.

David lowers the walkie from his face. The gray eyed man has a slight smile on.
Beat.

				 GRAY EYED MAN
		Why don't you go take care
		of your business?

The gray eyed man takes a bite of a nacho as he stares at David.

				 GRAY EYED MAN
		And dude, no one carries
		their merchandise on them
		any more. They got
		messengers for that shit
		now.
			(beat)
		That's what they tell me.

The gray eyed man in the blue sweat shirt turns and starts down the stairs to his
seat. He raises his fist in the air as someone scores a touchdown on the field.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL NURSE'S RECEPTION AREA - AFTERNOON

Jeremy is seated in a chair with abrasions and cuts on his face. He sits next to
a smaller boy with a thermometer in his mouth.

They're both looking at the glass window of the nurse's private office. There are
tow people inside talking. David and A WHITE HAIRED NURSE.

The THERMOMETER BOY pulls the thermometer out of his mouth.

				 THERMOMETER BOY
		Is that your dad?

Jeremy nods "Yes."

				 THERMOMETER BOY

Jeremy turns to the thermometer boy.

				 DAVID
		Megan handles that type of

				 NURSE
		What stuff is that?

				 DAVID
		Jeremy's stuff.

David feels uncomfortable as the nurse just stares at him. Beat. David rises from
his seat.

				 DAVID
		So do I need to put any
		smelly ointments on him or
		anything?

The white haired nurse nods, "no."

				 NURSE
		It's more emotional damage.
		It wasn't very serious
		physically.

David nods.

				 NURSE
		Nothing like when I sent you
		to the hospital.

David stares at the white haired nurse.

				 DAVID
		What was that?

				 NURSE
		My office was on the other
		side of the building back
		then.
			(beat)
		You don't remember me do
		you?

David nods, "no."

				 NURSE
		I had red hair.

David stares at the woman. He doesn't recognize her.

				 NURSE
		I think you were a little
		younger than Jeremy when it
		happened.
			(beat)
		Did you know we changed the
		conduct rules of the pool
		because of you?

David nods, "no" slowly.

				 NURSE
		The kids still talk about it
		like some ghost story..."Did
		you know there was a kid
		that almost drowned in the
		pool? He got pneumonia and
		almost died."

The nurse shakes her head.

				 NURSE
		We let them tell it... It

Beat.

				 NURSE
		Are you still phobic of

David seems lost in his thoughts. He looks up at the nurse.

		Yes I am.

EXT. BUS STOP - AFTERNOON

David and Jeremy are seated on a bench at a Septa bus stop. No one else is
waiting with them.

Jeremy talks without making eye contact with his dad.

				 JEREMY(soft)
		It was Potter and another

		They were messing with this
		Chinese girl. She's kind of
		fat. She doesn't talk to

			(beat)
		I tried to make them stop.
		They kept pushing me down
		and wouldn't let me get up.

Beat. Jeremy's VOICE STARTS TO TREMBLE SOFTLY.

				 JEREMY(soft)
		I thought maybe cause you
		were my dad, I thought I
		might be like you.

Jeremy finally looks up. Tears in his eyes.

				 JEREMY(soft)
		I'm not like you.

David moves closer to Jeremy on the bench.

				 DAVID
		You are like me. We both can
		get hurt. I'm just an

		I'm not what you think I am.

Jeremy just stares at his father. Beat.

		Why do you keep saying that?

INT. KITCHEN - EVENING

David stares at his bowl of pasta. He sits alone in the kitchen. Beat.

He gets up, slides the pasta in the trash and moves to the sink.

David is rinsing out the bowl when Megan walks in. David turns off the water.

				 MEGAN
		He's just laying in bed.
		He's pretty upset. He won't
		talk.

				 DAVID
		He's dealing with a lot of

			(beat)
		I think he needs to find
		answers himself.

Beat.

				 MEGAN
		It's weird to hear you tell
		me about Jeremy.
			(beat)
		A good weird.

David looks at Megan. They stand silently in an awkward pause. Beat.

				 DAVID
		Would you like to try going-

				 MEGAN
		Yes.

				 DAVID
		-out again.

Beat. David smiles.

				 DAVID
		But if we see another mother
		from Jeremy's school, me
		name is Juan. I always
		wanted to be a Juan.

Megan smiles softly back. Beat.

				 MEGAN
		Oh. Elijah Price came to
		visit me at the center
		today.

				 DAVID
		Jesus.

Megan sees David's shocked expression.

				 MEGAN
		He didn't do anything. He
		just told me his theory...
		It's sad when patients get
		like that. They loose
		reality.

				 DAVID(whisper)
		Jeremy what the hell are you
		doing?

Megan suddenly realizes David is looking over her shoulder.

Megan turns around. She SCREAMS.

Jeremy is standing in the doorway to the kitchen. He's crying hard. In his
outstretched hands is the HAND GUN FROM DAVID'S CLOSET. It's pointed directly at
David.

				 JEREMY(crying)
		You don't believe. I'll show
		you... You can't get hurt.

				 MEGAN(realizing)
		-Oh my God.

				 DAVID
		-Jeremy did you load that
		gun?

Jeremy nods, "Yes." Crying harder now.

				 JEREMY(crying)
		-You won't get hurt...

				 DAVID
		-Elijah was wrong.

				 MEGAN
		-Sometimes when people are
		sick or hurt for a long
		time, like Elijah, they're
		mind gets hurt too.

David shoots a tense glance at Megan.

				 MEGAN
		-They start to think things
		that aren't true. He hold me
		what he thought about your
		father. It isn't true.

				 JEREMY(crying)
		-I'll show you.

David starts moving a little to his right. Jeremy follows him with the barrel of
the handgun. David stops moving.

				 DAVID
		-You know the story about
		the kid who almost drowned
		in the pool?

Jeremy stops moving.

				 DAVID
		-That was me they were
		talking about. I almost
		died. That was me.

				 JEREMY(crying)
		-You're lying.

				 DAVID
		-I'm not. I just didn't
		connect it.

				 MEGAN
		-Jeremy, your father was
		injured in college - you
		know that. You know all
		about that.

Jeremy's small face tenses. Confusion mixes with the desperation on his face.

				 MEGAN
		-Don't do it. He'll die
		Jeremy.

Beat. Jeremy looks up, tears streaming down his cheeks.

				 JEREMY(crying)
		-I'll just shoot him once.

				 DAVID
		-Jeremy listen to what-

Jeremy starts pressing the trigger. The hammer clicks back.

				 JEREMY
		-Don't be scared.

				 DAVID
		-Jeremy if you pull that
		trigger I'm going to leave!
		I'm going to go to New York.

Jeremy freezes. David flashes a desperate glance at Megan then back to Jeremy.

				 DAVID
		You're right... If you shoot
		me, that bullet is going to
		bounce off me and I won't
		get hurt... but then I'm
		going to go upstairs and
		pack. And then leave to New
		York.

Beat.

				 JEREMY(crying)
		-Why?

Jeremy's hands are trembling. He starts to close his eyes as he raises the gun
level with David's chest.

				 DAVID(loud)
		Jeremy!

Jeremy's eyes open.

				 DAVID(loud)
		You're about to get into big
		trouble! I'm your father and
		I'm telling you to put that
		gun down right now God damn
		it!
			(beat)
		One!...
			(beat)
		Two!...

Jeremy puts the gun down on the floor in front of him and stands up.

Megan leans against the refrigerator and slides down to a sitting position on the
tiled floor.

David walks over and picks up the gun. He unloads the bullets in his hand. David
bends down very slowly and takes a seat on the kitchen floor.

Jeremy is the last to sit down. He takes a seat in the doorway of the kitchen.
Beat. He wipes his eyes with the back of his hand. Beat.

				 JEREMY(soft)
		...You didn't have to yell.

The Dunne family sits in silence on the floor of their kitchen.

INT. LIMITED EDITION - AFTERNOON

Elijah opens the door. It takes him a bit, because of the wheelchair.

David stares at Elijah's damaged condition. Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		Joined a rugby league.
		Turned out to be a bad idea.
			(beat)
		Come here I want to show you
		something.

Elijah wheels over to one of the framed sketches on the wall. It's a charcoal
drawing of a muscular figure shielding himself from a blow about to be delivered.
A huge ominous shadow is covering him, as if something unspeakable and evil is
just out of frame.

				 ELIJAH
		Look at this. I just noticed
		this today.

David steps in close and studies the drawing.

				 ELIJAH
		This is from the Sentryman
		series. A color version of
		this was actually used in
		the second issue.

Elijah points up to the drawing's face.

				 ELIJAH
		Look at this eyes. What do
		you see?

David looks right at the intense eyes of the drawing.

				 ELIJAH
		It's fear.
			(beat)
		He was scared. They were
		being honest in the
		beginning you see. They let
		him be human.
			(beat)
		They turned him into a
		garden variety hero later...
		Then he was brave all the
		time.

Elijah turns to David.

				 ELIJAH
		I followed the guy in the
		army jacket.

David becomes still as his words register.

				 ELIJAH
		He had a silver handled gun
		tucked in the back of his
		pants.
			(beat)
		Were you really injured in
		that car accident in
		college?

David looks unsteady all of the sudden.

				 ELIJAH
		Because I think you faked
		it. I think you took the
		opportunity to end your
		career - no questions asked.
			(beat)
		And I think you did it, of
		all things, for a women...
			(beat)
		Not only do you have the
		physical traits of a hero,
		down somewhere in there, you
		have the moral code of one
		too. You were ready to
		sacrifice everything for
		what's right. Where can you
		find that these days?
			(beat)
		Only thing you didn't realize
		is that you were giving up
		a part of yourself when you
		gave up football. The
		physical part. And you need
		that part desperately to
		feel balance again...
			(beat)
		You can have it back now.
			(beat)
		This was all just make
		believe before. What if
		there was someone the
		opposite of me? What if?...
			(beat)
		I now believe you are the
		genuine article Mr. David
		Dunne. The kind of person we
		knew existed, from our
		history.

Elijah points to the room full of pictures.

				 ELIJAH
		It's time for someone like
		you.
			(beat)
		Bad is winning. I can feel
		it.

Elijah looks at David with deep admiration. His voice cracked a little at the end
of his words. Beat.

David doesn't take his hands out of his pockets.

				 DAVID(rattled)
		I must have felt some lump
		in his back when I bumped
		him. Most guns have a black
		or silver handle. I had a
		fifty-fifty shot at the
		color.

				 ELIJAH
		That's not what I witnessed
		David.

				 DAVID
		Stop messing with my life
		Elijah. My son almost shot
		me last night. He wanted to
		prove you were right.

				 ELIJAH
		I never said you couldn't be
		killed. I never said that.

				 DAVID
		You have a problem, Elijah.
		My wife is right. Somewhere
		along the line one of your
		bones broke and your mind
		just broke with it.

Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		Are you finished?

				 DAVID
		No. And I have been sick. I
		spent a week in a hospital
		when I was a boy recovering
		from pneumonia and almost
		drowning.

				 DAVID
		Two skinny eight year old
		kids were playing around the
		pool. They were dunking me.
		I swallowed water. They
		didn't know it and they
		almost killed me.
			(beat)
		Heroes don't get killed like
		that. Normal people do.

Beat. Elijah seems shaken for the first time. David stares at him coldly.

				 DAVID
		I don't want to see you
		again okay.
			(soft)
		Now I'm finished.

David turns and starts for the entrance. The BELL OF THE DOOR CLANGS as David
Dunne leaves the store.

David exits the Limited Edition and moves down the street lost in this thoughts.
He bumps a man in a jacket and tie walking in the opposite direction.

THE MAN LOOKS AROUND QUIETLY BEFORE ENTERING THE CAR.

Megan enters the room in a beautiful brown dress.

				 MEGAN
		The sitter's here.

David nods, "yes." Megan studies his tense expression.

				 MEGAN
		We can do this another time

David looks from the action figures, to his son's face to the face of his wife.
They both have the same quiet anxious expression. Beat.

Megan smiles.

Jeremy giggles.

INT. DOWNTOWN COMIC BOOK STORE - NIGHT

An overweight man in sweats and a ponytail counts the cash in the register. We
are in a low-end comic book store. The walls are lined with shelves of comic
books. The more expensive issues are kept in a glass case.

THE PONYTAIL MAN looks at his watch and then to far back of the store where one
head is visible behind a low rack.

				 PONYTAIL MAN
		Hey man it's twenty after.
		It's time to close. I gotta
		head.

The top of the man's head doesn't move. Beat.

				 PONYTAIL MAN
		You better not be jacking
		off to the Japanese comics.
		I swear to God.

No response. Ponytail man closes his register and walks towards the back.

As he gets closer to the customer, he realizes that the man is in a wheelchair.
The Ponytail man walks ups to Elijah.

				 PONYTAIL MAN
		Listen man, I didn't know
		you were in-
			(beat)
		Just choose something all
		right?

Elijah doesn't react. He sits in his chair in a quiet daze. Ponytail man leans
over.

				 PONYTAIL MAN
		Hello. You understand
		English?

Ponytail man makes fake sign language gestures in front of Elijah's face.

				 PONYTAIL MAN
		Look man, I'm just gonna
		wheel you out. You can think
		about things outside on the
		sidewalk. I gotta get some
		chicken in me, you know what
		I'm saying?

Beat. The Ponytail man shakes his head moves behind Elijah. He starts wheeling
him towards the front of the store. They move down a narrow aisle of comics.

Elijah suddenly grabs the left wheel and turns the chair. His immobilized left
leg hits a rack of comic books. A handful of comics tumbles to the ground.

				 PONYTAIL MAN
		Shit.

The ponytail man straightens the wheelchair and starts down the aisle again.
After a couple of feet, Elijah jerks and grabs the other wheel sending the
wheelchair ramming violently into the opposite wall. Comics are knocked free and
fall onto the wheel chair and the nearby ground.

				 PONYTAIL MAN
		Dude, I don't care if you
		are in a wheelchair. If you
		do that again, I'm calling
		Five-O.

Beat. The Ponytail man takes Elijah's silence as a, "Yes." He straightens the
chair.

They move down the aisle. All is quiet... and then Elijah jerks the wheelchair to
the left again. His metal brace and the wheelchair crash into two racks. Elijah
gets covered in comics.

				 PONYTAIL MAN
		That's it crackerjack!
		You're going to sit your ass
		in jail now.

The Ponytail man moves to the front counter.

Elijah sits in a trance - slightly hunched over. His eyes stare at a comic book
in his lap. His expression changes for the first time.

The Ponytail man finishes dialing. He looks over to Elijah as he waits for a
voice on the other end. Elijah raises a single comic book in his hand.

				 ELIJAH
		How much is this one?

INT. RESTAURANT BAR - NIGHT

LATE EVENING. A trendy restaurant. Not enough light to read the menus.

David and Megan are on stools at one end of the bat. They sip their drinks as
they appear in deep thought.

				 DAVID
		...I think rust.

				 MEGAN
		Rust?

				 DAVID
		As a color, not as rust. You
		know, a rust colored paint
		or wood?

Megan leans slightly closer.

				 MEGAN
		I didn't know that. Mine's

				 DAVID
		My turn. What's your
		favorite song?

				 MEGAN
		Soft and Wet, by the Artist

		Soft and Wet. That's very

		My turn.

		When was the first time the

David's grin slowly fades.

				 DAVID
		That's not the game.

Megan moves her stool closer. They're only a foot or so apart.

				 MEGAN
		It's a second date. There
		aren't any rules.

Beat. David sips his drink slowly.

				 DAVID
		I'm not sure.

				 MEGAN
		Think carefully?

				 DAVID
		What about the game?

				 MEGAN
		It's finished. I won.

Beat. David glances at Megan. She waits for his answer.

				 MEGAN
		Maybe it wasn't a specific
		moment, maybe it-

				 DAVID
		I had a nightmare one night
		and I didn't wake you up so
		you could tell me it was
		okay.
			(beat)
		I think that was the first
		time.
			(beat)
		Does that count?

				 MEGAN(soft)
		That counts.

Beat. Megan takes her glass up to her lips. Doesn't take a sip. Brings it back
down.

				 MEGAN
		Do you knowingly keep Jeremy
		and me at a distance?

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Yes.

Megan's face tenses. She's on the verge of getting upset.

				 MEGAN
		Why?

				 DAVID
		I don't know Megan.

				 MEGAN
		It's like you resent us
		David. Resent the life you
		have.

Beat. David doesn't answer.

				 MEGAN
		You know even if it meant we
		couldn't be together, I
		would never have wished that
		injury on you? What you
		could so physically was a
		gift. I would never have
		wished it to go away.

Megan's eyes glaze with water. Beat.

				 MEGAN
		You know that right?

David takes a sip with a trembling hand. David's eyes look up and make eye
contact with Megan's. He stares at her for the longest time.

				 DAVID(soft)
		I know.

Husband and wife sit close together in the corner of the bar on their second
date.

INT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

Megan stands next to David as he pulls out his wallet. The babysitter with the
black dyed hair and Buddy Holly glasses stands ready to leave in the doorway.

				 DYED HAIR GIRL
		You got two calls. One came
		through while I was on the
		line - I wasn't talking too
		long. There was an emergency
		with my sister. She tried to
		do her own perm and now she
		looks like-

				 DAVID
		Who called through?

Megan tries to hide her smile.

				 DYED HAIR GIRL
		Someone from New York.

The smile instantly fades.

				 DYED HAIR GIRL
		About a security job at a

		you.
			(beat)
		I didn't know you guys were

		for telling me.

				 MEGAN
		We're not moving.

				 DYED HAIR GIRL
		Oh.

		I let the answering machine

The babysitter fixes her Buddy Holly glasses as she looks at the two suddenly
quiet faces.

David hands her the money. She opens the door. It's started to rain.

				 DYED HAIR GIRL
		Great.

The babysitter covers her head with her jacket and runs down the walkway. David
closes the door. Beat.

				 MEGAN
		Look let's be honest here.
		We're just at the beginning.
		I don't expect you or I to
		change the course of where
		our lives were headed
		because of two dates.
			(beat)
		If you do go to New York, we

		We'll just be forced to take

		that's definitely better.
			(beat)
		This is our second time

THE SOUND OF ELIJAH HANGING UP IS HEARD. THE ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS AS IT TURNS
OFF.

David hits a button on the answering machine. It makes a WHIRRING SOUND before
ANNOUNCING.

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

The master bedroom is very narrow. A bathtub and toilet are at one end. Two
identical sinks sit opposite each other.

David sits on the edge of the tub. His shirt is unbuttoned. He sits in a daze
staring at the tiled floor.

His eyes slowly move to a small white and red box laying on its side under one of
the sinks.

David rises and picks it up.

It's a BOX OF BAND AIDS. David looks up to Megan's sink. Perfume and lotions sit
on its edge.

David opens her mirrored cabinet. He starts to put the band aid box back, he
hesitates.

His eyes begin to roam the cabinet shelves. They stop on certain items... A
CONTAINER OF TYLENOL... A LOTION FOR DRY SKIN... A BOTTLE OF ALLERGY DROPS...
COUGH SYRUP...  A TUBE OF MUSCLE PAIN OINTMENT...

David just stands quietly for a beat before turning and looking across to his own
identical mirrored medicine cabinet.

There are three things on the shelf... DISPOSABLE RAZORS. SHAVING CREAM. AND
COLOGNE.

David's mouth opens just a little bit as he stares.

								  CUT TO:

INT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT

ALL THE LIGHTS ARE OUT.

David moves through the darkness down the stares in jeans and a sweatshirt.

He moves to the coat closet. Pulls out the dark green rain poncho. The word
"security" is almost faded away.

He opens and closes the front door with virtually NO SOUND.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. THIRTIETH STREET STATION - NIGHT

Rain falls like gunfire from the sky.

David's car pulls into the massive rain station parking lot.

David steps out and pulls the hood of the poncho over his head.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. METAL STAIRS - NIGHT

A steel fence leads to a set of stairs that travel down to the dozens of
interconnected tracks below. David walks down about forty feet. A fenced gate
with a lock stops his progress.

David looks through the fence down to the tracks. Just to the side is a
construction site. Cranes and lifts and various equipment stand idle in the area
next to the section of train wreckage that has been brought to the station
grounds for dismantling and salvaging. The bent shapes of the train pieces can
only be glimpsed in outlines as they sit in the darkness, hundreds of feet away
from the immaculately lit train station.

Beat. A HUGE METALLIC CRACK ECHOES THROUGH THE TRAIN YARD as David kicks open the
fence door that holds him back from going down.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. TRAIN WRECKAGE - NIGHT

Frightening twisted pieces of metal glisten in the rain. David walks along the
body of the caved-in passenger car.

The passenger car is split in two. Just before the tear, along the window line,
the windows have been crushed in. A huge hole has been ripped below the windows
exposing the ravaged interior.

David stands before this heavily damaged area of the car. He just stares at the
wreckage. Water falls off the rim of his hood in front of his face.

His eyes drift over the ominous pieces of deformed metal. He takes a couple slow
breaths as THE SOUNDS OF HARSH RAIN FADE AWAY TO SILENCE.

								  CUT TO:

FLASHBACK: EXT. STREET - NIGHT

SILENCE. BLACK. OUR VISION CLEARS TO REVEAL the glazed icy top of a street.

THE SOUND OF DISTANT FIRE COMES INTO THE SILENCE.

A TWENTY YEAR OLD DAVID DUNNE rises to his feet from the ground where he was
laying amongst the fragmented pieces of windshield. He looks down at himself. His
football jacket is torn. So are his jeans... He's trembling slightly, but not
bleeding.

HE LOOKS UP TOWARDS THE NOISES.

About thirty feet away is a Honda, upside down, wrapped around a telephone pole.
It's front is on fire.

Through one of the crushed door windows, WE SEE A WOMAN'S HAND.

Young David heads toward his car. He slips a couple of times on the slick iced
surface of the road.

He kneels down next to the inverted car. He looks in the crushed window frame.

THE FACE OF A TWENTY YEAR OLD MEGAN IS UPSIDE DOWN. She is unconscious.

				 DAVID
		Megan...

She doesn't answer. Her body is twitching as it sits pinned behind the wheel.

David pulls at the handle of the mangled door. It's wedged tight. It won't move.

The heat from the fire is tremendous.

David's powerful arms keep pulling with all their strength.

WE HEAR THE CREAK OF METAL... THE DOOR BENDS UNNATURALLY AND THEN PRACTICALLY
RIPS OPEN.

David leans into the car and unbuckles Megan. He works her out underneath the
steering column. He slides out. Her leg is bleeding.

David picks her up and carries her to the grass next to the road. He lays her
down gently.

				 DAVID
		Megan?

He just stares at her. She doesn't respond.

A LIGHT WASHES OVER THEM. David turns to see a truck approaching up the road.
David waves frantically. The truck slows.

David turns back to Megan. Her eyes are open.

Tears fall from David's face as he moves the hair out of her eyes. She looks at
David.

				 MEGAN(soft)
		I thought I was dead.

Beat.

				 DAVID
		Me too.

The driver of the truck slips and slides his way over to David.

				 DRIVER
		Is she all right?

				 DAVID
		I think her leg is
		fractured.

				 DRIVER
		Are you injured?

Beat. David looks at Megan who lays shivering in the grass. He looks back at the
driver.

				 DAVID(soft)
		My shoulder's hurt.

The driver nods.

				 DRIVER
		Hold on. I got a C.B. in the
		truck.

The driver moves back to his truck.

David takes Megan's hand in his and waits in the grass by the sight of their car
on fire.

								  CUT TO:

PRESENT: EXT. TRAIN WRECKAGE - NIGHT

David stands utterly still in the graveyard of train 177.

								  CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

The wheels of Elijah's wheelchair move down the hall as he follows the SOUND OF
THE PHONE RINGING.

He follows THE SOUND to a PHONE RINGING in the storage room of the store. There
are shelves and shelves of comic books. Thousands of them filed away in neat
piles.

Elijah picks up the phone a little out of breath.

				 ELIJAH
		Hello.

				 DAVID'S VOICE
		Elijah?

Beat.

				 ELIJAH
		David?

Nothing is said on the other line for a couple of beats. WE HEAR THE ECHOED DIN
OF A LARGE ROOM FILLED WITH PEOPLE AND MOVEMENT IN THE BACKGROUND.

				 DAVID'S VOICE
		What am I supposed to do?

Elijah closes his eyes. His face fills with strength.

								  CUT TO:

INT. THIRTIETH STREET STATION PHILADELPHIA - NIGHT

The interior of the station is a mystical sight. One huge cavernous room, a
football field in size, lined on both sides with giant pillars that rise into a
misty hand painted ceiling.

				 ELIJAH(v.o.)
		David, it's okay to be
		afraid. Because this part
		won't be like a comic
		book... Real life doesn't
		fit into little boxes that
		were drawn for it.

David stands in a quiet corner and watches the faces of passengers arriving and
departing late night trains. Even at the late hour, there is heavy traffic
throughout the station.

				 ELIJAH(v.o.)
		Go to where people are...
		You won't have to look very
		long.

David stares out at the midnight travelers. Beat. He starts towards them.

He passed the towering black statue standing at the far end of the station. It
watches over the whole building. It's in the form of an angel lifting a soldier
to heaven.

David moves through the first group of people - a crisscross of arriving
passengers from tracks one and two. They brush by him and lightly bump him as
they move.

FLASH CUT: WE ARE NO LONGER IN THE TRAIN STATION. A BLOND WOMAN IN HER TWENTIES
STANDS AT A COUNTER IN A CROWDED STORE.

SHE SLIDES THE SILVER BRACELET AND EARRINGS SHE WAS LOOKING AT OFF THE GLASS
COUNTER AND INTO HER PURSE. NO ONE SEES.

SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

David turns and glances at the blonde woman as she walks away from him towards
the exit of the train station. He doesn't stop moving.

David heads towards the densest part of the floor. The area near the information
board. Sleepy friends and tired family members stand and wait. A steady
spider-like web of movement flows as six  tracks let out on either side.

David moves to the center. His rain poncho almost touches the marble floor. Lines
of passengers emerging from trains below the main level move steadily on either
side of him.

David looks down and gently turns the palms of his hands out as they at his side.
His finger tops graze the jackets and clothes of the passengers walking by.

Dozens and dozens of people pass. Nothing happens. Then a man in a crumpled shirt
and slicked back hair brushes by...

FLASH CUT: THE SLICKED BLACKED HAIRED MAN LEANS OUT THE WINDOW OF A TRUCK. HE'S
HOLDING A BOTTLE OF BEER.

				 SLICKED HAIR MAN
		Go back to Africa!

THE SLICKED HAIR MAN THROWS THE BOTTLE WITH FORCE AS HE PASSES A CLACK FAMILY
WALKING ON THE SIDEWALK. THE BOTTLE SHATTERS AS IT HITS A WOMAN IN THE GROUP.

SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

David's eyes dart up as the slicked haired man turns the corner at the
information booth. He watches him for a beat.

FLASH CUT: WE ARE IN A BEDROOM. A YOUNG MAN IN HIS LATE TEENS LOOKS DOWN AT A
GIRL LAYING IN A PILE OF OVERCOATS ON A BED. THERE IS LOUD MUSIC AND LAUGHTER
COMING FROM SOMEWHERE DOWNSTAIRS.

				 TEENAGER
		What's your name? I think
		you drank too much.

THE GIRL MOANS SOMETHING INAUDIBLE AS SHE ROLLS ON HER SIDE. HER SKIRT RIDES UP
HER THIGH.

THE YOUNG MAN STARES AT HER AND THEN GETS UP. HE MAKES SURE NO ONE IS LOOKING
BEFORE CLOSING THE DOOR. HE LOCKS IT FROM THE INSIDE.

SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

David watches the teenager with baggy jeans hanging off his hip. He walks and
greets a group of identically dressed friends.

Beat. David turns his hands back in. He seems shaken. He takes a couple of deep
breaths as he gathers himself.

Then David steps back to look around. HE BUMPS the shoulder of a man standing
behind him.

David takes a sudden breath like someone punched him in the solar plexus.

FLASH CUT: AN ENORMOUS MAN WITH GLASSY EYES STANDS BEFORE A SCREEN SIDE DOOR.
HE'S BALDING. THE HAIR HE DOES HAVE IS SHOULDER LENGTH. HIS ECLIPSING SHADOW
FALLS ON THE CONSERVATIVE LOOKING MAN WHO STANDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN
DOOR INSIDE THE HOUSE.

				 GLASSY EYED MAN
		Can I come in?

				 MAN IN HOUSE
		Who are you?

				 GLASSY EYED MAN
		I like your house. Can I
		come in?

				 MAN IN HOUSE
		What is this?
			(beat)
		No you can't come in.

Beat.

				 GLASSY EYED MAN
		Are you sure?

The enormous glassy eyed man takes hold of the screen door handle. He turns it.
The man inside the house grabs the door handle on the inside to stop him.

				 MAN IN HOUSE
		What are you doing?

The man inside the house uses all his strength to keep the door from opening...
It opens slowly anyway.

SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

David stands frozen in the train station. His face is almost unreadable.

David is standing less than a foot away from the man he bumped. They're standing
shoulder to shoulder. David's eyes slowly move from the ground over his right and
then finally onto the man.

He's huge. At least three inches taller than David. His shoulders are massive.
He's wearing a one piece ORANGE UNIFORM.

The man in the orange uniform leans over a trashcan next to him and removes the
full trash bag within it. He replaces it with a fresh one. He throws the full
trash bag into a gray plastic bin with wheels and starts pushing it.

David watches the man head across the floor towards a double door marked "Station
Maintenance Staff Only".

Four identical gray bins sit outside the door. The huge man disappears with his
bin inside.

David waits. He just stares hard at the double doors. Nothing happens for the
longest time... No one comes out. David makes a decision. He starts towards the
doors.

And then they open.

The huge glassy eyed man in orange emerges carrying a bag over his shoulder. He's
wearing a baseball hat with his uniform now. He heads toward a back exit.

David lets him get about twenty feet away before deciding to follow him.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

The man in the orange uniform walks in the driving rain down a residential city
block. Almost all the lights in the middle class homes he's passing are off at
this late hour. No one is out walking except him and David Dunne fifty feet
behind.

The orange figure turns the corner onto a block of modest stand alone homes. The
uniformed man walks slower in this block. He looks around carefully as he moves.

He turns into a driveway of one of the homes. He stops and pulls a wad of mail
out of the mailbox.

David stands with the hood of his security coat covering his head and face. He
stands in the shadows and watches silently as the man in the orange uniform looks
over his massive shoulder before turning a knob and entering the white paneled
house through a familiar side door with a screen on it.

								  CUT TO:

INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT

The side door opens with almost no sound. The hooded figure of David Dunne steps
into a narrow laundry room. THE SOUND OF A TELEVISION IS HEARD FROM ANOTHER ROOM.

A very large pile of unopened mail sits in a mound on the clothes dryer. Two or
three days worth.

David shuts the door very slowly.

								  CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

THE SOUNDS OF CHEERING FROM THE TELEVISION IN THE NEXT ROOM SPILL INTO THE
KITCHEN.

David stares out from under his hood at the mess.

Cabinets are left open. Empty cans of food sit on the counter with a handful of
unwashed dishes. The breakfast table is the eeriest thing in the room. It sits
frozen with a plate of half-eaten, now moldy eggs at one setting and two bowls of
colorful cereal in another. The cereal has dissolved in the old milk. Two
cockroaches are crawling in the bowl.

David moves slowly to a door in the kitchen. It's slightly open. As David gets
closer, he shields his face from the strong smell. He pulls the door open
quietly.

A SHAFT OF KITCHEN LIGHTS FALLS DOWN THE STAIRS INTO THE BASEMENT. At the bottom
of the stairs is a MAN'S BODY. The same man who answered the door in the
flashback lays partly in the shadow, partly in the light. His crumpled tie lies
folded over itself on his still chest.

								  CUT TO:

INT. FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

A BOXING MATCH BLARES ON THE TELEVISION. Empty beer bottles and coke cans sit in
a pyramid on the coffee table.

David steps into the unoccupied room. His movements are slow and tense.

THUDS OF HEAVY FOOTSTEPS COME FROM THE CEILING OF THE ROOM. David looks up and
follows the SOUND AS IT MOVES AROUND ABOVE HIM.

David moves to the stairs as SOMEONE GETS KNOCKED OUT ON THE TELEVISION.

								  CUT TO:

INT. GIRL'S ROOM - NIGHT

Three closed doors converge on a landing. David opens the closest one.

It's a young girl's room. Posters of boy bands are on her wall. Clothes are
everywhere. The room is empty.

A NOISE COMES FROM THE HALF OPEN BATHROOM DOOR ATTACHED TO THE BEDROOM.

								  CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

A slightly overweight girl, probably fourteen years old is tied by her wrists
with a phone cord to the metal towel rack in her bathroom. She sits with her arms
pointed upward over her head. He knees tucked up to her chest.

Next to her is her younger brother. A skinny boy, maybe twelve. He's tied and
seated in the same way.

Their heads are leaned back against their arms. They're completely listless. Eyes
half mast. They watch as the door to the bathroom opens and the dark hooded
figure of David Dunne steps in. His long dark slowing rain poncho still dripping
water. He stands in the doorway for a moment before moving towards them.

They don't react in anyway as David reaches for the phone cord and unties them.
They're arms flop to their laps as they gaze up at the figure leaning over them.
They boy blinks once slowly.

David takes a step back and stares at them from under his hood.

				 DAVID
		You need to leave now.

								  CUT TO:

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

An exercise bike in the corner of the bedroom has been turned into a clothes
hanger long ago. The t.v. across the bed has framed family photos displayed on
top of it.

David's shadow passes over them as he moves towards the open bathroom on the
other side of the bedroom.

A woman is tied to the bathroom door handle. She sits on the tiled floor slumped
against the door. Her eyes stare blankly at the ground. She has considerable
bruises on her face and arms.

David stands before her.

				 DAVID(soft)
		Where is he?

The woman doesn't answer, but a SOUND COMES FROM THE SCREEN DOOR nearby. The
curtains draping the screen door move with the wind from outside.

David crosses the room and pushes aside the curtain. It leads to a small balcony.
An empty lawn chair is the only thing on it.

David steps onto the balcony and looks down.

The rain still pours down unmercifully. It comes down on a black tarp that covers
a pool in the backyard.

David turns to go back inside.

A BLURR OF ORANGE ATTACKS HIM.

The collision is sudden and explosive. The huge man drives his shoulder into
David's chest and takes him off his feet. David's body flips over the railing.

The dark green rain poncho flaps in the wind as he falls two stories directly
towards the black tarp.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. POOL - NIGHT

David lands on his stomach with a TREMENDOUS SLAP onto the nylon black tarp.

There's a thin layer of rain water on the tarp's surface. David is laying on his
cheek. Half his face is covered in water.

Beat. David's exposed eye looks around in a daze. The surface of  the tarp gets
pounded by the rain.

David uses his hands to push his body off the tarp. His hands sink into the water
as his pressure pushes the tarp down.

THE FIRST SOUNDS OF NYLON SLIDING AGAINST CONCRETE START.

David stops pushing. His vision catches the corner of the swimming pool as the
tarp slides out from under the sand bags that hold it in place.

The tarp sags. David becomes utterly still. THE SOUND CONTINUES ANYWAY.

One by one the tarp starts sliding out from under the sand bags all around the
edge of the pool.

And then without warning, the tarp caves in. It folds around David as he and the
tarp get pulled UNDER THE COLD DARK WATER.

								  CUT TO:

EXT.  UNDER WATER - NIGHT

David's body is tangled in the pool cover. His legs and arms thrash against the
constricting black tarp. He's drowning.

GLIMPSES OF LIGHT FROM THE HOUSE PIERCE THE DARKNESS UNDER WATER. THE BLURRED
IMAGE OF A DISTANT FIGURE HIGH ABOVE ON A BALCONY FLICKERS AND DISAPPEARS.

The last of the tarp slides out from under the sandbags that old it in place
around the edge of the pool.

The rain keeps falling.

The tarp moves like it's alive underwater. It shifts and wraps David tighter with
every movement.

GLIMPSES OF LIGHT AGAIN. TWO SMALL FIGURES NOW STAND IN A BLURRED SILHOUETTE NEAR
THE EDGE OF THE POOL. FLASHES OF SOMETHING SHINY THEY'RE HOLDING... A ROD OR
POLE... IT'S SHAKY NEBULOUS IMAGE WAIVERS IN THE AIR ABOVE THE SURFACE.

David's only free hand reaches for the light. It catches the silver pole.

The tangled mass of David and the tarp are pulled slowly towards the edge of the
pool. David's head and shoulders emerge from the darkness. He takes hold of the
pool's edge.

Huge desperate breaths as he pulls his body out from the water and the grasp of
the tarp. He hauls himself onto the ground.

He sits hunched over in a dark mass, his head down under his hood. The rain
poncho covering him like a blanket. Beat.

He rises to his feet. The water rushes off of him. His breathing is slowing,
calming.

He stands in a silhouette from the light of the house. He turns and looks to the
two small figures standing near the edge of the pool.

The children from the bathroom stand still in the rain. They're holding an
aluminum pole with a brush head for cleaning the pool. They stare up at the
hooded figure.

No one says anything.

								  CUT TO:

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

The man in the orange one-piece uniform stands over the woman tied to the door
handle of the bathroom. His back is to us. He's drinking from a beer bottle as he
looks down at her.

He doesn't notice the third presence come into the room. He doesn't hear him move
closer. Right behind him.

The man in orange takes another sip of his beer, not realizing an arm is reaching
over him... He doesn't get to swallow the sip in his mouth.

David Dunne's powerful arm wraps around the man's thick neck. David's hands clamp
together like and iron vise. He squeezes.

The man's beer bottle crashes to the ground as his neck begins to get crushed.

David yanks back hard, pulls the man off balance. The man's legs push back
violently, sending both of them backwards across the room. They come to a hard
stop as David's back gets RAMMED INTO THE BEDROOM WALL.

The huge man in orange pulls away and then SLAMS DAVID harder against the wall.
David's arm remains locked around his throat.

The man becomes frantic. His face turning dark red. He clutches at David's arm.
He spins, taking David with him into another wall. The IMPACT IS TREMENDOUS. The
room shakes. David holds on. His face bent low and hidden under his hood.

And then the man in orange throws a powerful elbow back. It lands hard right in
David's side. David groans. The huge man delivers another one. Savage, desperate
blows. WE HEAR THE IMPACT OF EACH ONE WITH DAVID'S BODY. And David never lets go.

The elbows slow and then stop. The legs of the man in orange start to buckle.

David pulls him back onto his heels. He turns him in a half circle. All of his
tremendous weight is hanging from David's arm now. David LETS OUT A YELL AS HE
APPLIES ALL HIS STRENGTH. The man's legs stop kicking.

David keeps turning him. The man's body goes completely limp. David's just
dragging two hundred and seventy-five pounds of weight in a circle over the
carpet now.

David slowly comes to a stop. He stands there with his arm wrapped around the
man's neck....The man's limbs dangle down to the ground. Beat.

David's hands let go of each other. His arm slips out from under the man's jaw.
The man in orange crumples to the ground like a rag doll. The only SOUND IN THE
ROOM IS DAVID'S HEAVY BREATHING. Beat.

He moves to the woman slumped against the door. He starts to untie the phone
cords that bind her wrists to the handle. He whispers to her.

				 DAVID(soft)
		It's over now.
			(beat)
		Your children are fine.
		They're getting help.

He unties her wrists. Her arms stay above her head where they were.

				 DAVID(soft)
		I'm going to go now.

He stares at the woman whose eyes stare blankly at him. She sits unnaturally
still against the door with her arms above her head. The mascara that has run
down her face and dried, has tracks where countless tears have rolled down.

David moves his hand near her mouth and nose. He checks for the feeling of breath
against his hand. Beat.

He rises up. Removes his hood. David Dunne stands silently in the master bedroom
of someone's house and gazes at the dead woman frozen in a slumped position
against her bathroom door.

								  CUT TO:

INT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT

The front door opens to SILENCE. The silhouetted figure of David steps into the
darkness of his home.

								  CUT TO:

INT. CLOSET - NIGHT

The dark green faded security poncho gets hung back on its hook in the closet
next to the family winter coats.

								  CUT TO:

INT. JEREMY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

David enters the quiet of Jeremy's room. Jeremy lays sound asleep. David stares
down at the shadowy figure of his son.

He pulls the blanket over the boy's small shoulder.

								  CUT TO:

INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

David sits on the edge of the empty bed in the darkness of his room.

He doesn't makes a sound. He doesn't move an inch. He is so still, he seems to
disappear into the shadows of the room.

								  CUT TO:

INT. GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

Megan stirs in her sleep. She shifts her head on the pillow.

Then her body RISES INTO THE AIR.

She starts to wake as she floats across the room. She opens her eyes and sees
David close by. He's carrying her in her arms. He moves up the stairs with her.
No words are spoken.

								  CUT TO:

INT. THEIR BEDROOM - NIGHT

They enter their bedroom. David lays her down gently on her side of the bed.

She watches as he walks out of sight. He lays down right behind her.

He covers her with his arm... His hand is shaking. Beat. He speaks softly.

				 DAVID(soft)
		I had a bad dream.

David tucks his head in close to hers and closes his eyes.

Megan lays stunned in her husband's arms. Beat.

				 MEGAN(soft)
		It's over now.

She closes her eyes too as the tears start coming.

						DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. STREET - DAY

Downtown Philadelphia.

People move up and down the sidewalks in front of the storefronts. David Dunne is
among them.

He crosses the street in front of The Limited Edition. The front doors of the
store are open.

A banner over the door reads, "Annual Sale."

								  CUT TO:

INT. LIMITED EDITION - DAY

The compact store is crowded with customers.

David spots Elijah with a group of people before a framed painting of a comic
hero.

David moves to a less crowded area of the store and waits. He turns and looks at
a framed sketch.

Beat. An older woman walks over from a near by picture and joins David.

				 WOMAN
		...See the villain's eyes.
		They're larger than the
		other characters'. They
		insinuate a slightly skewed
		perspective of how they see
		the world. Just off normal.

David stares at the drawing.

				 DAVID
		He doesn't look very
		threatening.

				 WOMAN
		That's what I said to my
		son. He said, there's always
		two kinds. The soldier
		villain who fights the hero
		with his hands, and then
		there's the real threat. The
		brilliant and evil arch
		enemy who fights the hero
		with his mind.

David turns and looks at the striking and beautiful African American woman in her
sixties who stands next to him.

				 DAVID
		Are you Elijah's mother?

The woman turns and looks at David for the first time.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		I am. I'm helping him with
		the sale.

				 DAVID
		It's a pleasure to meet you.
		I'm David Dunne.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		He's spoken of you. He says
		you're becoming friends.

				 DAVID
		We are.

David looks across the store at Elijah talking with the customers.

				 DAVID
		He's doing well today.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		I'm very proud of him.
			(beat)
		He's been through a lot in
		his life. A lot of ups and
		downs, a lot of bad spells.
		A couple I'd thought had
		broken him... I mean
		emotionally.
			(beat)
		They were bad... But he made
		it. Yes he did.

				 DAVID
		He's kind of a miracle.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		Yes he is.

They both watch Elijah from across the room.

				 ELIJAH'S MOTHER
		I'll tell him you're here.

David watches as Elijah's mother walks across the store and waits for Elijah to
finish talking.

David turns back to the framed sketch. He looks at it with his hands in his
pockets. Beat.

David's stare turns into a gaze. His gaze turns into stillness.

THE SKETCH is of a withered man with large tense eyes. He sits in the shadows.
He's seated in some type of machine. There are lots of buttons and levers on the
machine. The machine has wheels.

David turns from the sketch. He looks across the room to Elijah seated in his
wheelchair. Elijah's large eyes stay focused on the customer's as he finishes
negotiating.

David turns back to the sketch. He looks at it with growing confusion. The more
you look at drawing, the more the machine the man is seated in looks like a
wheelchair.

David looks back across the store. Elijah and his mother are talking. Elijah has
spotted David.

Beat. Elijah starts across the crowded store towards David. He wheels up to him.

				 ELIJAH
		Did you see this?

Elijah has a newspaper on his lap. He holds it up.

There's a drawing on the front page. It's a hooded figure shielding two huddled
children behind him.

				 ELIJAH(soft)
		It has begun.

David stares quietly at the sketch of himself.

				 ELIJAH
		When I saw it this morning.
		I felt a part of the world
		again.

Elijah looks down at the newspaper.

David hesitates and then reaches forward.

He reaches past the paper... And TOUCHES ELIJAH'S ARM.

FLASHCUT: AN AIRPORT GATE. ELIJAH IS STANDING AT THE WINDOW LOOKING OUT ONTO THE
AIRFIELD. HE'S CRYING.

SIRENS START SOUNDING THROUGHOUT THE AIRPORT.

WAITING PASSENGERS START GETTING UP AND MOVING TO THE WINDOWS.

				 MAN
		What's going on?

Elijah speaks to no one in particular as he stares out the window with tortured
eyes.

				 ELIJAH
		A plane just crashed.

								  CUT TO:

FLASH CUT: ELIJAH AND AN ELDERLY MAN IN A UNIFORM ARE SEATED IN A HOTEL BAR.

Elijah doesn't answer and doesn't turn around as he exits train 177.

SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

David takes two unsteady steps back. Elijah has tears in his eyes as he gazes
down at the newspaper. He looks up to David.

				 ELIJAH(low voice)

David looks like he stopped breathing as he backs up in the store.

Customers step between him and Elijah. Elijah becomes obscured and then blocked
from view.

								  CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - DAY

David emerges from the store slowly. He braces himself against a parked car and
then keeps on walking in a nightmarish daze.

WE PULL BACK as David Dunne blends in with dozens and dozens of ordinary people,
walking on an ordinary street, in an ordinary city.

               EXT. GRASSY PLAINS - DUSK

               BIRDS ARE FLUSHED FROM HIDING. A soldier carrying an automatic 
               weapon rises up out of the grass and looks around. A mortar 
               shell explodes nearby. There are no sound effects. He seems 
               unperturbed.

               Several more explosions in the field. The soldier motions 
               with his arm and:

               THE ELEPHANTS CHARGE OUT ACROSS THE PLAINS Each carries an 
               enormous load of supplies, and each is ridden by a soldier 
               with a rifle.

               A HELICOPTER GUNSHIP DIVES OUT OF THE SKY firing rockets at 
               the soldiers and elephants. A tribal mask is painted on the 
               nose of the chopper.

               THE ELEPHANTS REAR UP IN TERROR

               The soldiers on the elephants stand up and aim rifles at the 
               chopper and begin firing.

               INT./EXT. LOBBY OF THE 'NEW PEOPLE'S HOTEL' - DAWN

               A door slams o.s. and the figure of RUSSELL PRICE, 30, appears 
               at the top of some stairs. Sleepy-eyed, he pulls on a multi-
               pocketed fishing vest over a baggy shirt. He carries a beat 
               up canvas bag over his shoulder.

               A BLACK WOMAN, 40, sleeps at the lobby switchboard desk. 
               Another OLD BLACK MAN sweeps the floor. Price mumbles a 'good 
               morning' and goes to two vintage WW II vending machines -- 
               one for candy, one for Coca-Cola. He buys two candy bars and 
               a coke, and begins eating his "breakfast" as he crosses the 
               lobby.

               EXT. THE HOTEL - DAWN

               JIMMY, a cab driver, has been sleeping in a chair against 
               the wall. Several street vendors have their wares laid out 
               on the sidewalk against the hotel. Some are shaded by 
               makeshift awnings, some are not. Jimmy rises as Price arrives; 
               there is familiar ritual in their greeting.

               They cross the street together toward Jimmy's waiting taxi, 
               a hand-painted purple old American car with the words on the 
               door, "New People's Taxi Company" and Jimmy's name in script 
               above it. Price hands a candy bar to Jimmy.

                                     PRICE
                         'Morning, Jimmy, think you could 
                         squeeze me in?

                                     JIMMY
                         Where is you would care to go at 
                         once, Mr. Price?

                                     PRICE
                         Bang-bang.

                         Twenty dollar.

               Price hands him a wad of bills.

                                     PRICE
                         You're a thief, Jimmy.

               Jimmy smiles broadly, nodding, then points to the sky.

                                     JIMMY
                         Booteeful picture, huh, snap-snap?

                         I don't do skies.

               The two men get into the strange cab parked in front of an 
               open marketplace just starting to come alive; the cab drives 
               off.

               EXT. A REMOTE AFRICAN VILLAGE - DAY

               The taxi arrives, and Price gets out.

               Price ambles over to stand in the early morning shade against 
               an old building. A hand-painted image of Che Guevarra -- 
               with an X painted over it -- is on one wall. Price pulls a 
               joint from his pocket and lights up, taking a hit.

               The sounds of war machinery soon interrupt the stillness. 
               Price hurries to the corner.

               P.O.V. A JEEP LEADING AN ARMY CONVOY

               Price pulls a handful of colored rags from his pocket and 
               picks out a yellow kerchief, tying it to his arm. Price then 
               steps boldly into the street in front of the approaching 
               convoy. He exchanges shouts with an officer in a jeep, and 
               with a motion is given permission to join.

               PRICE CLIMBS INTO THE LAST OF THREE TROOP TRUCKS

               Each truck is filled with perhaps 25 African soldiers in 
               khaki, each holding an automatic rifle. Another jeep follows, 
               towing a World War II cannon.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE THE TROOP TRUCK - DAY

                                     PRICE
                              (cheerily)
                         Hi, guys.

               The soldiers look over disinterestedly. Two dozen cases of 
               Coca-Cola are tied to a stretcher among stacks of guns.

               As Price settles in for the ride, he begins pulling cameras 
               from his bag. Quickly and automatically, rarely looking, he 
               switches lenses, loads film, and prepares his cameras. He 
               has done this a thousand times.

               A SINGLE WHITE SOLDIER -- OATES, rises from among the blacks, 
               and shakily makes his way toward Price. A mercenary dressed 
               in a ragged uniform of his own design, carries two machine 
               guns and a .45. He smiles broadly, recognizing Price. HODGE 
               slaps Price's hands as if they were teammates.

                                     OATES
                         G'damn, Price, you tuna sucking piece 
                         of raw meat -- whatchyou goin' to 
                         Zambeze for?

                              (shrugs)
                         Ahh. Dope-wise, this place sucks.
                              (looks around, leans 
                              in confidentially)
                         Lotta fuckin' coons around here, eh?

               They nod. He laughs obscenely and deeply.

                                     PRICE
                         I thought you were fighting for the 
                         Government?

                                     OATES
                         I am. This is the Government.

                                     PRICE
                         These are the Rebels.

                                     OATES
                         Fuck they are. This is a Government 
                         convoy to Calunda.

               Pause.

                         You're shitting me.

               Pause. Finally Oates starts laughing uncontrollably.

                                     OATES
                         These guys be pissed if they knew,

                              (Price nods in 
                              agreement; Oates 
                              suddenly gets serious)

                              (Price nods in 
                              agreement)
                         Nicaragua. That's the spot. Cheap

               EXT. THE REBEL'S AIRFIELD - DAY

               The convoy rumbles past a check-point into a small airfield 
               containing a motley collection of DC-3's and old planes. TWO 
               RUSSIAN ADVISORS and THREE CUBAN ADVISORS watch.

                                     OATES
                         Well hell... I wonder where the 
                         fuckin' Guvmint is?

               As he speaks, the cab of the truck is rocked with a mortar 
               shell and explodes. Soldiers scramble to safety. Some grab 
               the guns being transported.

               TWO SOLDIERS GRAB THE STRETCHER OF COKE and start running 
               for safety. Smoke and explosions are everywhere -- they 
               abandon their cargo and run for cover.

               OATES SCRAMBLES TO SAFE GROUND quickly and instinctively, 
               looking around wildly to "read" the situation. Price dives 
               next to him.

               A SOLDIER IS HIT AND GOES DOWN NEARBY, staggering towards 
               Price and Oates.

               A DC-3 GOES UP IN FLAMES IN THE BACKGROUND

               THE WOUNDED SOLDIER REACHES FOR OATES who darts out quickly 
               and drags the injured Rebel to safety.

               PRICE HAS HIS CAMERAS OUT AT ONCE and is firing away.

               TWO REBEL SOLDIERS POINT TO THE STRETCHER OF COCA-COLA and 
               start moving toward it through the smoke. They want to rescue 
               the soft drinks.

               PRICE LEAPS FROM HIS BUNKER AND RACES TOWARD THEM dangerously, 
               waving and shouting as he does.

                                     PRICE
                         Hold it! Hold it!

               They don't speak English but stop at his craziness.

               PRICE STOPS AND AIMS HIS CAMERA, and as he does he motions 
               for the soldiers to continue.

               P.O.V. THE FRAMED IMAGE -- SOLDIERS, SMOKE AND COKE IN B.G. 
               As the soldiers move toward the Coke, Price snaps picture 
               after picture.

               A MORTAR EXPLOSION BLOWS THE COCA-COLA TO A MILLION BITS The 
               two soldiers stop short -- several more steps and they would 
               have been killed. Price's intrusion has accidentally saved 
               them. The two soldiers run toward safety, bewildered and 
               scared.

               ON THE AIRFIELD - THE SMOKE CLEARS AND ALL IS CALM

               Gradually the airfield comes back to life. Several teams of 
               medics run with stretchers from the hut and begin gathering 
               bodies. Rebel soldiers appear from every conceivable shelter 
               and move across the field.

               Oates emerges and meets Price on the torn up runway amidst 
               the rubble. They look around at the devastation.

                                     OATES
                         Well, I guess we know where the 
                         Guvmint is.

                                     PRICE
                              (cynically)
                         You can walk to work from here.

                                     OATES
                         Convenient, ain't it?

               Oates starts to walk away, then stops and speaks earnestly, 
               as if trying to connect to a real world that doesn't exist.

                                     OATES
                         My brother just got married.

                         I don't know your brother.

               Suddenly, the distant roar of a jet. All the soldiers on the 
               field scan the horizon; Price looks up. The air raid siren 
               goes off.

               A JET DIVES OUT OF THE SKY TOWARD THE AIRFIELD OATES AND THE 
               SOLDIERS DIVE TO COVER

               JET STREAKS OVERHEAD and, instead of rockets and bombs, it 
               drops something else:

               THE SKY IS FILLED WITH A MILLION PIECES OF PAPER The jet 
               pulls out and disappears. All is quiet again as the million 
               papers flutter in the sky above the airfield.

               Out of frustration a single soldier fires a couple of shots 
               at the paper.

               Price grabs a piece of paper out of the air. It is:

               INT. HOTEL ROOMS AT THE NEW PEOPLE'S HOTEL - NIGHT

               CLAIRE STRYDER, 40, reads a report over the telephone as she 
               times the call with a stopwatch. A photograph of Claire's 
               high-school-aged daughter sits on her dresser.

               ALEX GRAZIER, 50, struggles with his tie and a drink at a 
               dresser in the adjoining room. Their connected rooms are 
               littered with hand washed laundry and the paraphernalia of 
               their trade -- typewriters, tape decks, books, notes, 
               pictures.

               Their love affairs of three years is ending.

                                     CLAIRE
                              (on the phone)
                         "...and so this strange war that 
                         features two provincial governments, 
                         three rival liberation fronts, and 
                         at least twenty-five tribal 
                         associations, grinds into its seventh 
                         year..."

               Alex picks up a Melodica, a novelty wind instrument, and 
               tries to court her with "Caravan" as she files her story. 
               Though mildly put off, she maintains her cool throughout the 
               call. He thinks he's Paul Desmond.

                         must be the connection. Okay? So 
                         long.

               She hangs up and rises more irritated than angered.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Alex, don't play that God damn thing

               Quickly expressed, her anger passes.

                         It's my party -- we'll be late. You 
                         called it a "strange war" and an 
                         "endless story." If you filed that 
                         story for me, I'd say you were 
                         editorialishing.

                         I like to editorialize. You drunk?

               Alex loves to be melo-dramatic and is quite conscious of his 
               ability to charm. He's also aware that it's worn off with 
               her.

               The door doesn't open, and the light flickers.

               He bangs the door with his fist. It opens, and they enter a 
               dismal hallway. The sounds of a party come from beyond.

               A cheer goes up for Alex as he and Claire enter. Party hats, 
               booze, hand-made signs reading "Bon Voyage," etc. Fifteen 
               journalists of varying nationalities cover this backwater 
               war.

               Though both upset, they act as if everything is normal.

               PRICE STANDS ON A CHAIR AT THE CENTER summoning Alex who 
               moves through the group with ease, instantly at home. Price

               However miserable, Alex shines in these situations. He raises 
               his hand -- silence.

                                     ALEX

               Claire slips to the side bar and pours herself a drink, 
               watching Alex and shaking her head with some affection.

               JIMMY, THE CAB DRIVER, ENTERS WITH A CAKE covered with 
               candles. The crowd parts for the cake shaped like the country 
               of Chad. The crowd begins singing "Caravan" in a half-drunken 
               tribute to a man they like and respect.

               PRICE MOVES AROUND THE ROOM TAKING PICTURES of the party; it 
               is all casual, silly, fun.

               once he has managed to give in to it.

               life is ending -- life with Alex -- but it's not ending 
               neatly.

               A ROW OF HANGING PHOTOGRAPHS catches her eye. She stops and 
               looks closely -- then laughs in spite of herself at a series 
               of pictures: PHOTO OF A TALL AFRICAN NATIVE WITH A COCK SO

               Silence. Price moves behind her and gently kisses her on the 
               ear. She smiles quickly and nervously.

                                     CLAIRE
                         No.

               He kisses her on the neck.

                         For godsakes, Russell, listen.

               The sounds of the party can be heard. He ignores them and 
               moves around her, trying to kiss her on the lips. She puts 
               her hand over his mouth.

               Price reacts strongly, flaring slightly and withdrawing.

                                     PRICE

                         I'm going back to the party.

               She heads to the door; Price stays. She stops before getting 
               there, hesitates, then pulls the PHOTO OF THE ELEPHANT from 
               the string and returns to Price, handing him the photo.

               He doesn't respond. They stand for several moments -- the 
               sounds of the party get louder. She turns and heads to Alex's 
               celebration, leaving Price alone in the darkroom.

               PRICE LOOKS AT CLAIRE AS SHE LEAVES, stares aimlessly for 
               several moments, then focuses back on his PHOTO OF THE 
               ELEPHANTS.

                                      NICARAGUA 1979

               EXT. THE STREETS OF MANAGUA - THE CAPITOL - AFTERNOON

               CLOSE ON: TIME MAGAZINE WITH COVER PHOTO OF THE ELEPHANTS, 
               gradually PULL BACK to reveal other magazines, candy, cigars, 
               Nicaraguan toys, all in a corner shop, and finally:

               A FIRE TRUCK LEADS A PROCESSION through the streets -- a 
               group of middle class Nicaraguan women carry a banner that 
               reads "Our Revolution is in Christ" (in Spanish), followed 
               by three Catholic PRIESTS in bright robes, followed by a 
               sound truck with P.A. system, followed by hundreds of 
               townspeople carrying banana leaves and religious signs. All 
               are singing a Catholic hymn in a swaying, hypnotic rhythm. 
               Small red and black flags are scattered throughout.

               A CAB DRIVING THROUGH THE STREETS runs into the parade and 
               stops. Price sits in the front seat -- his luggage is tied 
               precariously to the roof. The trunk of the cab has been 
               smashed in beyond repair. Price hops out of the cab with his 
               camera bag -- he doesn't know what the parade is about but 
               it looks great. He hands the cabbie some money to stay nearby.

                         Wait here.

               He runs to join the procession.

               PRICE HOPS ONTO THE RUNNING BOARD OF THE FIRE TRUCK and almost 
               simultaneously his light meter is out. HE is surrounded by 
               images: SMALL GIRLS DRESSED AS ANGELS LINE THE STREET, 
               TOWNSPEOPLE HANG FROM DOORWAYS AND WINDOWS, ICE CREAM CARTS 
               AMONG RELIGIOUS ICONS, SOLDIERS WITH GUNS STAND IN SMALL 
               GROUPS ALONG THE PARADE ROUTE.

               PRICE IS QUICKLY TAKING PICTURES OF EVERYTHING, changing 
               cameras, occasionally taking a quick light reading; his 
               actions are instinctive and automatic. Suddenly:

               TEN YOUNG TEENAGERS BURST INTO THE PARADE They wear red and 
               black handkerchiefs, baseball caps, and strange masks. They 
               are chanting:

                                     TEENAGE BOYS
                         Rafael, Rafael, Rafael... libre o 
                         muerte... Rafael...

               A LARGE PAINTING OF THE FACE OF RAFAEL is carried aloft on a 
               stick, draped with red and black scarves.

               PRICE PHOTOGRAPHS the boys and the painting.

               NATIONAL GUARD SOLDIERS SHOVE INTO THE PARADE Up and down 
               the street they spring into action, running for position 
               with their guns.

               An ice cream vendor is knocked down, a mother clutches her 
               "angel" daughter, another child is whisked inside a door as 
               the Soldiers break into the procession.

               THE "MUCHACHOS" WITH RAFAEL TURN TO RUN but realize that the 
               soldiers have cut off their escape.

               THREE SOLDIERS BREAK into the parade and are separated from 
               the boys only by a group of Priests. Trapped, the boys panic, 
               but as the SOLDIERS push towards them:

               THE PRIESTS BLOCK THE SOLDIERS and intentionally scuffle 
               with them, allowing the boys just enough time to dart into a 
               house. One of the boys drops the picture of Rafael as he 
               heads in the door.

               THE CROWD PUSHES FORWARD, the route to the door is blocked 
               off, and the boys escape.

               SOLDIERS FIND THE PORTRAIT OF RAFAEL and shoot it full of 
               holes with their automatic weapons.

               PRICE PHOTOGRAPHS "RAFAEL" as his image is ripped to shreds 
               with bullets.

               The singing and the parade march on.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Overlooking Managua is a sub-tropical paradise that seems 
               far removed from a brutal civil war, this one time tourist 
               watering hole serves as home base to the international press. 
               The cab pulls up, and Price gets out. The driver unties his 
               luggage from the roof as TWO PRESS CORPS MEMBERS recognize 
               Price and greet him as an old friend.

                         Welcome to Managua.

               They shake hands warmly, and Price sits down. Price points

                         of them knew where the hell Chad was 
                         anyway -- it legitimized their 
                         ignorance, got you a cover, me a 
                         feature, and packaged a class struggle 
                         in two words. Nifty, eh?

               IN THE BACKGROUND CLAIRE WALKS INTO THE POOL-BAR AREA She 
               carries her handbag and some papers -- she stops short seeing 
               Price sitting with Alex. She hesitates, starts toward them, 
               stops, and sits down at the bar at the opposite end of the 
               pool.

               Price sees her, and she sees Price. They pretend they don't. 
               Price turns to Isela and launches into a stream of broken, 
               chauvinistic Spanish with his usual elegance.

                         it's called a war. It started in 
                         nineteen thirty. Before you were 
                         born.

                         be able to photograph our war.

               Price looks at each of them and decides not to push.

               Alex stands to help Isela from her chair. Price presses on, 
               instinctively and effortlessly.

               Alex turns to Isela, who stops as she rises.

               A beat, then Price asks his question almost sexually, as if 
               he thinks he could seduce Isela, Rafael, the whole war.

                         I'll figure out the rest.

               Isela seems to welcome the question. Her tone is less flip, 
               and she focuses hard on Price.

               floats magically through the pool area.

               Price frames her with his fingers as if composing a shot.

               P.O.V. OF ISELA THROUGH PRICE'S FINGERS Isela kisses another 
               journalist, grabs someone's hand, and lands gracefully at 
               another table.

                         So far this war's got it all over 
                         Africa.

                                     ALEX
                         You're gonna have a ball.

               ALEX PLACES HIS HAND OVER PRICE'S "FRAME" blocking out his 
               view of the sexy Isela. Though Alex's tone is gentle, the 
               threat is obvious.

                                     ALEX
                         Hands off. I need an interpreter 
                         more than you do right now.

               Price takes the hint.

                                     PRICE
                         You still hanging in there with 
                         Claire?

               Alex chooses his words carefully and speaks slowly.

                                     ALEX
                         I'm hanging in there like an interim 
                         post-war government waiting for the 
                         palace to be overrun... by younger 
                         men.

               Silence and an uneasiness that Alex intended. Price manages 
               a smile.

                                     PRICE
                         Younger men.

               Alex smiles disarmingly.

               CLAIRE RISES AT THE OPPOSITE BAR, picks up her papers, and 
               heads straight for the two men with a bounce in her step.

               BOTH MEN ARE A BIT SURPRISED AT HER ENTRANCE and she hands a 
               stack of mail to Alex.

                                     CLAIRE

                         Just now.

               She shakes Price's hand in a friendly manner that comes out 
               awkwardly, then races past the moment to address and entertain 
               both men.

                         talk to me.

                         Who's Tacho?

               They turn to Price as if everyone knows who Tacho is.

                                     CLAIRE
                         That's President Somoza's nickname.

                         Want me to order you a hot dog and a 
                         program?

               A bit of tension and awkwardness -- Claire quickly takes 
               control and changes the tone.

                                     CLAIRE

                         C'mon, we've all got something to 
                         celebrate.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE VIKING CLUB OF MANAGUA - NIGHT

               Corrugated metal roofs, thatched hut booths, a strange 
               combination of decorative and architectural devices. DAISY 
               WILLIAMS, a large black woman from Nicaragua, sings "I Left 
               My Heart in San Francisco" with a mediocre jazz group.

               HUB KITTLE is present, and other journalists drop by the 
               table to say hello.

               A BOY PHOTOGRAPHER, 13, aims an ancient bellows type polaroid 
               at a booth in which Claire sits between Alex and Price. They 
               are holding a pose indefinitely while the boy struggles with 
               the camera. They hold up the TIME COVER and a couple of beers 
               in celebration, and when he finally snaps the picture -- no 
               flash.

               The boy puts the camera down disappointedly.

                                     BOY PHOTOGRAPHER
                              (in broken English)
                         Sometimes it doesn't work.

               The three journalists relax their pose.

                                     PRICE
                         Let me look.

               ON THE BANDSTAND Daisy has just finished "San Francisco" and 
               spots Alex, motioning to him.

                                     DAISY
                         Ladeez and Gen'mun, hep me get Aaleex 
                         ov' here...

               Daisy applauds lightly for Alex to join them. Alex is equally 
               pleased and embarrassed.

                                     ALEX
                         There's not many piano bars left 
                         where I'm still welcome.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Go ahead.

                                     ALEX
                         If she can't sing in the key of C 
                         I'm in trouble.

               Alex excuses himself and joins Daisy on the bandstand. Price 
               and Claire are left alone in the booth as Price hands the 
               repaired camera back to the boy.

               ALEX AT THE PIANO begins a slow, easy cocktail version of 
               "Stardust," the song of his generation perhaps, and he seems 
               happy, seduced by his own chords.

               PRICE AND CLAIRE RESUME THEIR POSE, and this time the camera 
               FLASHES. Price pays for the picture from the boy.

               At first there is a moment of awkwardness between them.

                                     PRICE
                         Well...

                                     CLAIRE
                         "Well"... you finished your assignment 
                         in Chad?

                                     PRICE
                         Got Africa all wrapped up and pouched 
                         to my editor.

               She smiles and relaxes a bit at the typical Price remark.

                                     CLAIRE
                         You're going to love this war, 
                         Russell... there's good guys, bad 
                         guys, cheap shrimp...
                              (an afterthought)
                         And Alex is still singing in the 
                         background.
                              (beat)
                         I missed you.

                         We gotta get alone somewhere to talk.

               ALEX BEGINS SINGING as he plays. He sings like a trumpet 
               player -- no voice but great phrasing. He half smiles as he 
               sings, enjoying the song and enjoying making them 
               uncomfortable.

               ALEX AT THE PIANO

                                     ALEX
                         Sometimes I wonder why I spend these 
                         lonely nights, Dreaming of a song...

                         Alex is one of the world's leading 
                         experts on military strategy.

               They don't really want to talk about Alex though his presence 
               is unavoidable. Price changes gears, gets slightly goofy, 
               and steers the conversation to more comfortable turf.

                                     PRICE

                         Well... about sixty years ago the 
                         U.S. Marines invaded to protect 
                         American business interests and put 
                         down a peasant revolt led by a little 
                         man who wore a giant cowboy hat --
                         his name was Augusto Sandino... In 
                         nineteen thirty-four he was murdered 
                         at a peace conference, and the Somoza 
                         family has ruled ever since...

                         about the peasants -- I mean the 
                         real stuff.

               She knows what he means, but she wants to tease him a bit 
               first.

                         hot, hot -- but don't touch. She 
                         belongs to Tacho, and if anybody 
                         gets caught with her then El

                         And the lake's already polluted.

               Price is impressed, and yet another new face drops by the 
               booth -- they both recognize and see him coming, a 
               contemporary of Price, REGIS FLYNN, a scraggly British 
               journalist who heads over to their table holding three beers.

               Regis slides into their booth, happy to see them.

               He nods; they all sip beers and watch Alex sing.

               INT. THE NIGHT CLUB KITCHEN

               A teenage DISHWASHER looks around nervously, then pulls a 
               paper sack from off the shelf, removing a strange mask from 
               it. He pulls the mask over his head. Then from the bag he 
               removes a hand-made zip gun, puts a bullet in it, and darts 
               into the shadows of a nook, waiting.

               BACK TO THE BOOTH where Regis softly croons a few bars of 
               "Stardust" into Claire's mike. The three of them are having 
               a good time, mildly drunk at best, and uninhibited.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE CLUB

               As we hear Alex's gentle rendition of the standard, a NECKING 
               COUPLE moves back into the shadows of the club. Each pulls 
               on a mask, as in the b.g.:

               ISELA AND AN ELEGANT MAN ARRIVE AT THE CLUB

               The man, somehow out of place, dresses with casual continental 
               style, not overdone but expensive and tasteful -- clearly 
               from another world. He wears a neat hat and moves gracefully. 
               Isela looks stunning, dressed for the evening. The DOORMAN 
               greets them familiarly.

               Isela casually checks her watch as they enter the club.

               The masked couple in the shadows check their watches.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE VIKING CLUB

               As Isela and the man enter, commanding attention without 
               trying. Isela stops at the piano long enough to kiss Alex 
               gently before sitting in the booth with the man.

               IN PRICE'S BOOTH the new arrivals have caught their attention -- 
               Price and Alex still clown slightly, and Claire teases them.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Jesus... Louis Jordan walks in, and 
                         I'm sitting with the Everly Brothers.

                                     REGIS
                         Before you fall in love -- that's 
                         Marcel Jazy... friend of wine, women, 
                         and Somoza. They say he's a 
                         businessman...

                                     CLAIRE
                              (interrupting)
                         He's a businessman in search of a 
                         business... he doesn't try very hard 
                         to cover up his connections to the 
                         C.I.A...

               P.O.V. OF JAZY LIGHTING ISELA'S CIGARETTE

                                     CLAIRE
                         But look at his moves -- can the 
                         C.I.A. light cigarettes like that?

                                     PRICE
                         What's wrong with the Everly Brothers?

               THE WAITER ARRIVES AT PRICE'S BOOTH and sets down three shrimp 
               cocktails and more champagne, as:

               INT. THE BACK DOOR OF THE CLUB

               It opens quickly, and three more MEN IN MASKS enter quickly.

               BACK TO THE BOOTH as the waiter speaks with a firm coolness.

                                     WAITER
                         Please stay at your table, and you 
                         won't be hurt.

               A FACE IN A MASK MOVES QUICKLY PAST PRICE'S TABLE

               ANOTHER MASKED FACE COMES OUT OF THE KITCHEN The dishwasher 
               waves a gun.

               TWO MASKED FACES -- THE COUPLE -- ENTER THROUGH THE FRONT 
               DOOR The woman carries an automatic rifle and guards the 
               entrance.

               THREE MASKED FACES APPEAR Almost materialize from thin air, 
               moving silently and without commotion. The music winds down 
               slowly. (Six Guerrillas total)

               A GUERRILLA QUICKLY SPRAYS AN IMAGE ON THE WALL With a few 
               deftly drawn strokes, the FACE OF RAFAEL magically appears. 
               The name "RAFAEL" is written under the face, then other names 
               and revolutionary slogans. As this takes place:

               A WOMAN GUERRILLA HAS A GUN AT THE HEAD OF A NICARAGUAN 
               BUSINESSMAN The middle-aged, well-dressed local sits with 
               his wife and two other men. They freeze in fear, the nightclub 
               freezes, as the GUERRILLAS take control of the room swiftly 
               and smoothly.

               ONE GUERRILLA FACES THE NICARAGUAN BUSINESSMAN at the table 
               and speaks loudly but without panic. The masked Guerrillas 
               around the room are serious but nervous.

                                     GUERRILLA LEADER
                              (in Spanish)
                         We do not want to waste any ammunition 
                         on a head as empty as yours -- but 
                         we will.

                                     BUSINESSMAN
                              (in Spanish)
                         What is this?!

                                     GUERRILLA LEADER
                              (in Spanish)
                         Shut up! Get up!

               The BUSINESSMAN refuses. The GUERRILLA LEADER takes a hand 
               grenade from his pocket and pulls the pin without hesitation, 
               then holds the grenade in front of him fearlessly, inches 
               away from the Businessman's face.

               The Businessman rises slowly. The LEADER motions toward the 
               back door of the club.

                                     GUERRILLA LEADER
                              (in Spanish)
                         You are coming with us -- you will 
                         not be hurt -- we will trade you for 
                         the release of some Nicaraguans who 
                         care about Nicaragua.

               The woman with the gun shoves it into the man's head forcing 
               him to move toward the kitchen door.

               PRICE TAKES PICTURES QUICKLY WITH A TINY CAMERA that fits 
               into the palm of his hand. Neatly, surreptitiously, and calmly -- 
               Price is coolest in any crisis.

               CLAIRE PUNCHES ON HER TINY TAPE RECORDER instinctively, and 
               a tiny red light comes on.

               THE BUSINESSMAN IS SHOVED TO THE DOOR He hesitates, afraid 
               to leave the room. The Guerrilla shoves the grenade in his 
               face; the woman sticks the gun into his neck even deeper.

               MASKED GUERRILLA AT THE FRONT DOOR SHOUTS FOR THEM TO HURRY

               THE BANDMEMBERS -- INCLUDING ALEX -- BACK AWAY FROM THE 
               BANDSTAND Alex trips over the drum set slightly -- a clanging 
               clash of cymbals startles everyone, and as the drama freezes:

               THE KITCHEN DOOR SWINGS OPEN, AND THE BOY PHOTOGRAPHER EMERGES 
               Innocently, the young boy struts out of the kitchen to see 
               what's going on, and as he does the DOOR STRIKES THE ARM OF 
               THE GUERRILLA WITH THE GRENADE, and:

               THE GRENADE IS KNOCKED FREE For an instant, everything 
               freezes, and:

               THE GRENADE ROLLS ACROSS THE FLOOR Daisy Williams, the singer, 
               runs away screaming as the grenade comes to rest near a 
               crowded section of the club.

               A Guerrilla guarding the side door rushes for it, picks it 
               up, and as he does:

               THE GRENADE EXPLODES IN THE GUERRILLA'S HAND A brutal 
               explosion -- the ceiling caves in partially, the musical 
               instruments explode, and:

               THE SANDINISTA GUERRILLAS DART FROM THE ROOM through various 
               doors. The boy photographer lies bloodied. The Guerrilla who 
               picked up the grenade is a barely recognizable corpse. The 
               Businessman is soiled but unhurt.

               ONE HALF OF THE CLUB BREAKS OUT IN FLAME As a broken gas 
               pipe feeds a sudden outburst of fire, the club's patrons 
               panic -- screaming and shoving towards the door as the ROOM 
               LIGHTS UP, and:

               PRICE'S LIGHT METER IS OUT AT ONCE followed quickly by a 
               35mm camera, quickly clicking off picture after picture of 
               the club amid the flames and panic. The new light makes his 
               job easier.

               PRICE TAKES A LIGHT READING near the body of the boy 
               photographer. He sees the boy's camera lying nearby. Price 
               puts away his light meter and feels the boy's pulse, then 
               puts his ear to the boy's heart -- making sure he is not 
               still alive.

               LA GUARDIA SOLDIERS AND FIREMEN FILL THE ROOM

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE PRESS ROOM AT THE INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL - LATER

               The chaos of a busy, cramped Telex room. A switchboard -- 
               several journalists trying to place phone calls. Press come 
               and go -- coffee, cigarettes, and half-eaten sandwiches.

               CLAIRE TEARS A STORY OFF THE TELEX while Price stands to the 
               side of the action eating a sandwich and watching.

               ALEX STANDS AT THE CENTER OF IT ALL Established as the senior 
               figure (or one of them) to whom other, younger journalists 
               come for information.

               A YOUNG JOURNALIST, a Time stringer, is slightly distraught 
               on the phone, and interrupts Alex's dealing with others, 
               cupping the phone, to announce:

                                     TIME STRINGER
                         ...it's Charlie, from New York -- 
                         says that a terrorist bombing of a 
                         Central American restaurant isn't 
                         big enough to hold for the world 
                         section...

                                     ALEX
                         Tell him we have pictures.

                                     YOUNG JOURNALIST
                         He knows.

                                     ALEX
                         Tell him there were pieces of body 
                         in the piano, and somebody was 
                         singing, "I Left My Heart in San 
                         Francisco."
                              (beat)
                         What's he got better than that?

                                     TIME STRINGER
                         He's got the Pope visiting Egypt.

               Alex grabs the phone in disgust and launches in.

                                     ALEX
                         Forget the Pope, Charlie. Every week 
                         you got the Pope somewhere. This is 
                         a very big story down here because 
                         it's the first sign of fighting in 
                         Managua.
                              (beat)
                         Yeah, well get a map and look up 
                         Nicaragua -- ya drive to New Orleans 
                         and turn left.

               While Charlie argues on the other end of the phone, Alex 
               initials papers and performs several jobs at once.

                                     ALEX
                         Like hell I'm editorializing, the 
                         whole thing happened in a roomful of 
                         C.I.A. and press. What do you want?!
                              (beats)
                         How do I know they were C.I.A.? They 
                         wore name tags, what do you think? 
                         We're backing a Fascist again -- I 
                         know that ain't news, but see if you 
                         can find an angle!

               HUB KITTLE has been floating through the room and, upon 
               hearing the word "fascist," takes offense and approaches 
               Alex.

                                     HUB
                         Hey! There's fascists and then there's 
                         fascists, right? Be careful how you 
                         throw words like that around.

               Alex ignores Hub though he is slightly pestered by him, and 
               continues on the phone as he initials papers brought to him.

                                     ALEX
                         We don't have any pictures of Rafael 
                         because nobody knows where the son 
                         of a bitch is, and anybody crazy 
                         enough to go after him...

               Alex spots Price who is standing nearby, still eating a 
               sandwich, still enjoying the high energy buzz of the room. 
               Alex directs his next line so that Price cannot fail to get 
               the message. Alex plays the moment coolly.

                                     ALEX
                         ...is liable to get his nuts shot 
                         off.

               Hub nods seriously, in agreement. Price turns. Alex smiles. 
               Price smiles. Alex hangs up, grumbling, then turns his 
               attention to the persistent Hub Kittle.

                                     ALEX
                         Yeah, well g'bye...
                              (to Hub)
                         Who the fuck are you?

                                     HUB
                              (extending a hand)
                         Hub Kittle. I'm with Lewitsky and 
                         Knupp -- New York. We have a client 
                         down here.

               Alex is irritated but fascinated.

                                     ALEX
                         Who?

                                     HUB
                         President Somoza.

               Alex is incredulous that Somoza employs a New York P.R. firm. 
               Hub is professionally used to this reaction -- no panic.

                                     HUB
                         I know, I know...
                              (beat)
                         But there's an untold story here. I 
                         mean, the man has a point of view 
                         too, right?

               Alex turns to leave; Hub corners him.

                                     HUB
                         We got a national anthem contest 
                         going on right now, and you guys are 
                         ignoring it. Lotta human interest.

               Alex turns to other business though Hub persists.

               ELSEWHERE IN THE ROOM a young NICARAGUAN WOMAN, 18, is talking 
               to Claire. She seems to be part of the local press.

                                     CLAIRE
                         I want you to get me copies of the 
                         Government inventory lists of all 
                         captured Guerrilla weapons. I want 
                         to know if the guns are Israeli, 
                         Belgian, Russian, Cuban...

                         Fine -- give me proof.

               A TELEPHONE OPERATOR CALLS TO CLAIRE through the chaos.

                                     OPERATOR
                         Su hija, su hija! Your daughter from 
                         Los Angeles.

               Claire sighs at the bad timing but seems delighted to be 
               interrupted by her daughter, and brushes aside a Stringer 
               forcing paperwork upon her. Claire takes the phone into a 
               bare, adjacent hallway for some privacy.

               IN A BARE HALLWAY Claire talks to her daughter.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Hi, baby! How are you?
                              (beat)
                         Has Grandmother spoiled you silly by 
                         now? She has? Good.
                              (beats)
                         Yes, I got your letter with the 
                         picture of your new boyfriend. He's 
                         very good looking... but he's a bit 
                         old, isn't he? No? Just how old is 
                         he?...

               P.O.V. FROM THE TELEX ROOM TO CLAIRE Price knows this is not 
               his world, and he wanders outside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MANAGUAN STREET NEAR THE HOTEL - LATER THAT NIGHT

               Price bounces along, whistling, "San Francisco." An occasional 
               Guardia jeep or taxi rumbles past. He strolls up the walkway 
               of a house from which comes a strange, blue glow.

               INT. THE MONEYCHANGERS HOUSE - NIGHT

               Blue walls, bare bulbs, several pictures on the wall, and an 
               old woman lying in a hammock. Music in the b.g. Price 
               approaches her and hands her a $100 bill -- there is a brief 
               negotiation of the black market value.

                                     PRICE
                              (in broken Spanish)

                         Diezysiete.

               She shrugs, declaring the negotiation ended, and leaves the 
               room to change the dollar into cordobas. Price idly studies 
               the pictures on the wall:

               PICTURE OF ANASTAZIO SOMOZA IN WHITE, PICTURE OF THE VIRGIN 
               OF GUADALUPE, PICTURE OF SANTA CLAUS, FADED NEWSPHOTO OF 
               HANK AARON HITTING HIS 715TH HOME RUN.

               PRICE SMILES AND TURNS RIGHT INTO A SHARP BAYONET mounted to 
               a rifle held threateningly by a Guardia soldier.

               THE SMALL ROOM IS FILLED WITH NATIONAL GUARDS We haven't 
               heard them enter over the sounds of music and our 
               preoccupation with the pictures.

                                     PRICE
                         What is this? I'm a journalist!

               No answer. Price pulls a thick passport and press credentials 
               from a pocket, handing them to the Officer in charge.

                                     PRICE
                         Journalista, journalista!

               The officer looks at Price's passport photo, studies it 
               briefly and takes the passport. He nods.

               A rifle butt is jammed violently into Price's belly -- he 
               doubles over. The Officer nods, and Price is led away.

               As the Guard hauls him outside, the OLD WOMAN appears in the 
               doorway with a stack of local currency.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MILITARY HOLDING CELL - NIGHT

               Price is led into a dark cell where another PRISONER, 50, 
               lies in street clothes on the floor. The Prisoner is spat 
               upon by the Guards and kicked awake. Price cringes.

                                     GUARD
                         Padre Puta, Padre Puta, Padre Puta...

                         Here is a Priest for you to confess 
                         your sins.

               The Guards laugh and leave. The Prisoner rises to his feet. 
               Price keeps his distance. The Prisoner looks in bad shape.

                                     PRISONER PRIEST
                         Cigarillo?

               Price hands him a cigarette and lights it. A long, deep drag.

                                     PRICE
                         Priest?
                              (the man nods)
                              (in broken Spanish)
                         What are you doing here?

                                     PRISONER PRIEST

                              (in Spanish)
                         I don't take sides. I take pictures.

                              (in Spanish)

                              (in Spanish)
                         No.

               The Prisoner Priest looks at Price with disdain.

                                     PRISONER PRIEST
                         Periodista Puta, todos periodistas

                              (All journalists are 
                              whores)

               The Prisoner sits down in the corner ignoring Price who is 
               surprised to be treated so despicably.

                                     PRISONER PRIEST
                              (quietly)
                         Go home.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A BRIGHTLY LIT ROOM

               Price is led into a lineup of 10 people, all Nicaraguans. 
               The room is narrow and so brightly lit that at first he covers 
               his eyes.

               FIGURES MOVE IN THE SHADOWS A Guardia soldier moves up and 
               down the lineup, stopping to point at a prisoner. In the 
               line we recognize the WAITER from the Viking Club. Price 
               speaks to the soldier in a calm, reasoned tone.

                                     PRICE
                         Mi amigo -- mala interpretacion, eh? 
                         Periodista, comprende? Famoso. Time 
                         magazine.

               The soldier whirls at Price in a rage out of all proportion 
               to Price's tone, shouting:

                                     SOLDIER
                              (in Spanish)
                         Shut up!

               Price holds up his hands -- he may be fearless, but he's not 
               stupid. The soldier pulls a knife, then pulls his own tongue 
               from his mouth, and makes motions with the knife as if cutting 
               out his tongue. The message is clear -- Price doesn't speak.

               The soldier walks up to the Waiter and points. The Waiter is 
               frightened.

               Through the shadows we see an officer talking with a civilian 
               in a hat. The civilian points to a door.

               THE WAITER IS LED AWAY THROUGH A DOOR protesting desperately 
               as he goes. The soldier moves to the next prisoner -- he too 
               is led away. This repeats itself until the soldier arrives 
               at price.

               THE SOLDIER POINTS TO PRICE

               PRICE'S P.O.V. THROUGH THE SHADOWS The civilian is in a 
               discussion with the officer -- it is clear that his opinion 
               affects the decisions. For a moment Price doesn't know where 
               he's going to be led. The civilian points to a different 
               door -- it opens -- and Price steps down off the display 
               rack into a room.

               THROUGH THE DOOR as Price steps through, the action continues 
               with the other Nicaraguan prisoners. Price looks around 
               quickly, but the Civilian and Officer are gone. He is quickly 
               shown into a bare office.

               INT. THE BARE ROOM

               Pictures on the wall of Somoza and the FLAG RAISING AT IWO 
               JIMA. Price's cameras and bag sit on a desk.

               P.O.V. THE CIVILIAN THROUGH A DOOR -- IT IS MARCEL JAZY His 
               rumpled elegance is at odds with the brutal surroundings. 
               The door closes.

               A SENIOR OFFICER ENTERS THE BARE ROOM, and Price addresses 
               him at once.

                                     PRICE
                         Soy un periodista.

                                     SENIOR GUARD OFFICER
                              (in excellent English)
                         Mr. Price... you must accept our 
                         deepest apologies for the 
                         misunderstanding. Somebody saw you 
                         taking photographs of terrorists 
                         hooligans in the parade and at the 
                         nightclub -- our young officers get 
                         carried away... they're always looking 
                         for traitors.

                                     PRICE
                         That film is half way to New York by 
                         now.

                                     SENIOR GUARD OFFICER
                         I know, I know... It was all a 
                         misunderstanding... una mala 
                         interpretacion. Your cameras.

               The Officer reaches for one of Price's cameras and hands it 
               to him, but as he does:

               THE CAMERA DROPS TO THE GROUND AND BREAKS -- SILENCE The 
               Officer would love for Price to get angry.

                                     SENIOR GUARD OFFICER
                         I'm sorry.

               Price smiles barely, and refuses to pop off.

                                     PRICE
                         Forget it.

               Price puts his cameras in his bag, and as he is shown from 
               the room he notices a copy of the TIME MAGAZINE WITH ELEPHANT 
               sitting on the desk.

                                     SENIOR GUARD OFFICER
                         This way.

               Price is shown to a door, handed over to a soldier, and led 
               outside into the night.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               Claire stands at the main doorway surrounded by GUARDS, an 
               OFFICER, and an unidentified CIVILIAN -- she is arguing with 
               them in rapid Spanish, not allowing them to get in a word.

                         Jazy?! You think there's a story 
                         there?

                         Ahh... C.I.A. stories are all alike.

                         No. You?

                         I figure you probably want to do a 
                         little research on the history of 
                         Marcel Jazy's business connections 
                         in the third world countries with 
                         C.I.A. influence...

                         Oh. I assumed you'd just look him in 
                         the eye and say "Gimme a break, for 
                         crissakes, Marcel, are you a spy or 
                         aren't you?"

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. GARDEN COURTYARD OF MARCEL JAZY - DAY LATER

               Marcel Jazy stands, drink in hand, looking slightly rumpled 
               in the daylight, slightly older, but more charming and self-
               effacing than his first impression indicated. His two story 
               Mediterranean style house is in slight disrepair; the gardens 
               are scraggly and overgrown. The pool is empty. Jazy addresses 
               Price and Claire.

                                     PRICE
                         ...are you a spy or aren't you, eh?

                                     JAZY
                              (smiling)
                         Spy is such an odd word, Mr. Price... 
                         nobody is a... 'spy'... anymore.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Russell prefers pictures to words...

                                     JAZY
                         You don't have to apologize... you're 
                         journalists.

                                     CLAIRE
                         And you're a businessman?

                                     JAZY
                         A businessman? That sounds good. 
                         Okay, I'm a businessman.

                                     PRICE
                         Why was I arrested, and why did you 
                         get me released, and who are you?

               As he speaks, the questioning comes to a sudden halt as a 
               SPECTACULAR LOOKING WOMAN emerges from the shadows of the 
               house into the light of the courtyard. She is tall, Latin, 
               and besides high heels wears only a shiny, high fashion 
               swimsuit, cut high on the legs.

               Price, Claire, and Jazy stop to watch as the woman stops to 
               look into the empty pool.

                                     WOMAN IN SWIMSUIT
                         No agua.

                                     JAZY
                              (nodding)
                         No agua.

                                     WOMAN IN SWIMSUIT
                              (in Spanish)
                         Oh, Marcel! You told me there would 
                         be water in the pool this week!

               Jazy leans in very coolly to Price and Claire as he pours an 
               extra glass of wine and speaks softly in English again.

                                     JAZY
                         If she dove in, I assure you she 
                         wouldn't notice.

               He carries the glass of wine to the woman, smiling warmly.

                                     JAZY
                              (to Miss Panama in 
                              Spanish)
                         Sweetheart, the Guerrillas knocked 
                         out the pumping station on the road 
                         to Masaya, and we must ration water 
                         for the time being. Next week maybe 
                         things will be better.

                                     WOMAN IN SWIMSUIT
                              (in Spanish)
                         Maybe I should go back to Panama.

                                     JAZY
                              (in Spanish)
                         Maybe you should.

               Jazy pushes a lounge chair over to her and hands her a glass 
               of wine. The woman unfolds gracefully into a lounge chair in 
               the sun. Very sexy. She reaches for and kisses Jazy's hand 
               affectionately -- he kisses her forehead. She feels better 
               now.

               Jazy motions for Claire and Price to follow him inside.

               INT. JAZY'S HOUSE - DAY

               The pool is visible in b.g. His house, like the pool, is 
               rumpled and slightly sloppy though it betrays the taste of 
               its occupant -- books everywhere, pictures on the wall, 
               nothing cheap or tacky but everything is well worn.

                                     JAZY
                         You were arrested because the Guardia 
                         are clowns who specialize in excess. 
                         You were released because I told 
                         them to release you.

                                     CLAIRE
                         These are not the normal duties of a 
                         businessman.

               He looks at them directly.

                                     JAZY
                         But they are the normal duties of 
                         a... spy, eh? You win, I'm a spy.
                              (smiles)
                         There, are you happy? I feel better.

               He refills their glasses.

                                     JAZY
                         Now we can relax. You can turn off 
                         your little thing.

               The red light of her recorder is on. She smiles slightly, 
               undisturbed, and turns it off.

                                     JAZY
                         Oh, I trust you won't say anything 
                         to hurt me. In some ways I'm a 
                         terrible spy. I used to be much better 
                         at it, but now it seems everyone 
                         knows who I am. I have too many 
                         girlfriends. I like to be 
                         photographed.
                              (beat)
                         I talk too much.

               Price and Claire are almost afraid to speak, afraid to 
               interrupt this strange performance.

                                     JAZY
                         I always talk too much... but my 
                         girlfriends like that... No matter.
                              (pointing to the 
                              swimsuited woman)
                         You know who she is?

                                     CLAIRE AND PRICE
                         No.

                                     JAZY
                         That's Miss Panama. Do you know who 
                         that is?

                                     CLAIRE AND PRICE
                         Oh, yeah, yes, etc.

                                     JAZY
                         She's in love with me. I've got to 
                         get some water in the pool.
                              (beat)
                         And once a week I have lunch with 
                         President Somoza to discuss security 
                         measures against the Sandinista 
                         insurgents, but all he wants to talk 
                         about is Miss Panama... he's worried 
                         about her.

               Claire interrupts with a smile.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Because he thinks she's seeing another 
                         man?

               Jazy smiles slightly before confirming.

                                     JAZY
                         ...and he assigned me to find out 
                         who the man is.

               They all smile at this complication. Price is impressed. 
               Jazy changes the subject with fluent and disturbing ease.

                                     JAZY
                         We all know the Revolutionaries are 
                         going to win, don't we?

               Silence. They don't know how to respond.

               THEIR P.O.V. AS MISS PANAMA STRETCHES LIKE AN ENORMOUS CAT 
               They all are slightly entertained and glad for the relief.

               Unsure what to say next, Price notices a picture on the wall:

               CLOSEUP - A BLOWN-UP FRAMED PHOTO OF THE RANCH HOUSE WITH 
               POOL

               The same picture we saw on the leaflets in Africa.

                         There's a rumor about this picture. 
                         Some people say you're a genius -- 
                         that you invented this scheme.

                         It was lots of people's idea... Have 
                         you been to Leon?

                         the Rebels have hit the cuartel.

                         It's supposed to be nasty there... a 
                         lotta people think Rafael's in the 
                         South. I want to find out.

                                     JAZY
                         No, no, it's not "nasty" yet. Another 
                         week maybe.
                              (beat)
                         You would love Leon. A nice cathedral

                         Of course, of course... only I have 
                         heard that Comandante Rafael has 
                         recently had his unit in the area.

                         Well... it's a rumor, what do I know?

               The voice of Miss Panama.

                         You think I talk too much?

               He doesn't wait for an answer, but excuses himself and goes 
               out to tend to Miss Panama.

               P.O.V. OF JAZY AND MISS PANAMA BY THE EMPTY POOL as Jazy 
               touches her, whispers, and she waves to Claire and Price.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. PRICE'S HOTEL BATHROOM - DAY

               Early morning. Price lathers up with shaving cream for the 
               first time, cleaning up. As he applies the lather he stops, 
               and slowly draws a face on the mirror with shaving cream 
               until he is staring at:

               THE IMAGE OF RAFAEL IN SHAVING CREAM ON THE MIRROR

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. NICARAGUAN COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

               A RENTED CAR WITH WHITE FLAGS turns onto the road to Leon. 
               Price drives, eats, and reads a map. Claire takes the map 
               from him and reads it herself. They seem to enjoy their first 
               moment alone without Alex looking over their shoulder. A 
               small band-aid is on Price's clean shaven cheek.

               REFUGEES ARE STREAMING OUT OF LEON, mostly women and children,

               A GUARDIA ROADBLOCK ON A HILL OVERLOOKING THE CITY

               The press car pulls up to a stop. Price and Claire get out 
               quickly, hand their credentials to a soldier, and open the 
               trunk and the hood. As the car is searched they look down at 
               the city.

               P.O.V. LEON AS A PLANE CIRCLES FIRING ROCKETS AND SMOKE RISES 
               from several places in the town. The sound of gunfire.

                         down there? Not me.

               The soldier laughs at the journalists and hands back the 
               credentials.

                                     SOLDIER

               Price and Claire remove their things from the car, and Price 
               takes the distributor cap as well as the keys. They walk 
               over and look down the road leading into the city under seige.

               MORE REFUGEES EVACUATE THE TOWN -- it is a most uninviting

               PRICE AND CLAIRE WALK SLOWLY INTO LEON

               Looking around warily as they go, they are the only people 
               entering the town. Claire speaks softly into her tape recorder 
               as they walk in, recording the event without editorializing.

                         everywhere... a body...

               THE BODY OF A YOUNG MAN lies ignored on the sidewalk. They 
               continue walking and soon come to:

               AN INTERSECTION HELD BY LA GUARDIA TROOPS WITH A TANQUETTA 
               Price and Claire duck into a doorway, protected in effect by 
               the Government soldiers who wait silently, guns ready, around 
               the corner of a building. We see what they're waiting for.

               A YOUNG SANDINISTA COMES OUT OF A BUILDING a block away, 
               holding a handgun. Momentarily confused, he begins running 
               toward us, toward the soldiers waiting in ambush. The 
               Guerrilla races quickly to his waiting death, and as he turns 
               the corner right into a dozen Guardia troops:

               THE GUARDIA GUNS OPEN UP ON THE YOUNG GUERRILLA, killing him 
               instantly.

               CLAIRE TURNS HER HEAD AWAY unable to watch.

               PRICE RECORDS THE EVENT WITH HIS CAMERA

               THE GUARDIA FOLLOW THE TANQUETTA SLOWLY down the street toward 
               the Rebel youth's house. Suddenly the intersection is empty.

               PRICE AND CLAIRE MOVE DOWN A SIDESTREET SLOWLY as:

               SEVERAL GUERRILLA MUCHACHOS DART OUT OF AN ALLEY with 
               sharpened sticks, a spear gun, and one home-made gun. The 
               Muchachos hesitate briefly, lost, and see Price.

               THE MUCHACHOS QUICKLY POSE FOR A PICTURE motioning for Price 
               to record them. They pose instantly in "tough-guy" posture.

               PRICE TAKES THEIR PICTURE and just as quickly they dart away 
               through a bombed out building.

               THREE SANDINISTAS LEAP OFF A ROOFTOP and race toward Claire 
               and Price who freeze:

                                     CLAIRE
                         Russell?!

               For a moment they aren't sure what this means -- are they in 
               trouble? The Sandinistas shove past the two journalists, 
               pushing open a doorway and disappearing inside. For a moment 
               Price and Claire are alone on the street.

               THE DOOR OPENS AGAIN SLOWLY and a middle-aged WOMAN appears, 
               motioning for them to come inside.

               INT. PEDRO'S HOUSE - DAY

               The Three Sandinistas, dressed half in khaki, half recycled 
               disco, are pleading with a young man, PEDRO, 15.

                                     SANDINISTA #1
                              (in Spanish)
                         You must come and help us... one 
                         more time.

                                     PEDRO
                              (in Spanish)
                         No, please...

               One of the Sandinistas brings Pedro his rumpled baseball 
               jersey from another room.

                                     SANDINISTA #2
                              (in Spanish)
                         For Leon... for Nicaragua!

               Pedro sees Price and Claire and is more interested in them. 
               He speaks in broken but understandable English.

                                     PEDRO
                         Americans? Journalists?

                         Yes.

               Pedro lights up, and runs to a shelf where he returns with a 
               baseball he is signing.

                                     PEDRO
                         Ah! I put my autograph on this ball.

                                     SANDINISTA #1
                              (in Spanish)
                         Pedro! There is no time to waste.

               Pedro is more interested in the two Americans.

                                     PEDRO
                         When you get back to the United 
                         States, I want you to give this ball 
                         to Tippy Martinez for me. He is from 
                         Nicaragua.

               Pedro hands Claire the baseball as the Sandinistas plead 
               with Pedro for his help. He is more interested in getting 
               the baseball delivered to Tippy Martinez. Claire accepts the 
               ball graciously, exchanges awkward glances with Price, and 
               puts it in her shoulder bag.

                                     SANDINISTA #1
                              (in Spanish)
                         Enrique is dead! Roberto has 
                         disappeared! The Guardia has the 
                         church, and we need you!

                                     PEDRO
                              (to Claire and Price)
                         You come, eh?
                              (to the Sandinistas)
                         Can they come with us?

                                     SANDINISTA #2
                         Come! Everybody come!

               They go to the door and open it a crack to look out.

               P.O.V. THE TANQUETTA PASSES as Soldiers kick open doors across 
               the street.

               The Sandinistas go to a corner of the room and push a book 
               shelf out of the way. A large hole has been broken in the 
               wall. They climb through the hole into the living room of 
               the next house; the woman pushes the shelf back over the 
               hole with great effort.

               INT. THE NEXT HOUSE - DAY

               A family huddles in the corner as the MAN OF THE HOUSE pulls 
               back a couch and a hanging blanket, revealing another hole 
               knocked in the wall. The Sandinistas, Pedro, Claire and Price 
               scramble through.

               P.O.V. THROUGH A SERIES OF DOOR-SIZED HOLES IN THE WALLS of 
               all the houses on the block, connecting the homes with a 
               secret passageway. The six of them race through the houses, 
               each hole opening and then closing magically.

               INT. THE KITCHEN OF A TINY SIDEWALK RESTAURANT - DAY

               The Three Sandinistas, Pedro, Claire, and Price emerge. A 
               WOMAN, 50, runs the cafe and welcomes them. The SIX crawl so 
               as not to be seen from the street; they stop long enough to 
               survey the plaza.

               P.O.V. THE CENTRAL PLAZA OF LEON DOMINATED BY A HUGE CATHEDRAL 
               Half a dozen bodies are scattered across the plaza. Otherwise, 
               it is empty.

               P.O.V. SIX GUARDIA SNIPERS IN THE CHURCH TOWER control the 
               plaza. As we watch, they fire off occasional shots in 
               different directions--there is no way to cross the plaza.

               THE WOMAN PULLS A TRAY OF "CONTACT BOMBS" from the oven, 
               home-made grenades that look like muffins on a tray. Pedro 
               grabs one and pretends to bite into it. The Sandinistas start 
               to laugh and catch themselves as Pedro clowns. Claire and 
               Price aren't sure what the "muffins" are and don't respond; 
               mostly they are on edge. The contact bombs are put in a sack.

               The woman opens a trap door in the floor, and the six of 
               them climb down a ladder into a tunnel.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TUNNEL UNDERNEATH THE FLOOR - DAY

               Pedro leads them with a candle through a dark passage under 
               the street. Overhead we hear gunfire. Rats scurry, and water 
               runs through an open sewer.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE CATHEDRAL - DAY

               A tapestry rug is pulled away, and Pedro's head appears. He 
               climbs out and soon all the party is in the church. A PRIEST 
               leads them quickly through an immense, nearly. European 
               interior of ornate altars and burning candles. The small 
               party is led to a small corner of the sanctuary where a long, 
               rickety ladder leads up to the roof.

               THE SANDINISTAS SCRAMBLE UP THE LADDER as it sways. Pedro 
               follows with his sack of contact bombs. Then Price goes up 
               as the Priest holds the ladder. The American is much larger 
               than the Nicaraguans -- the ladder squeaks and sways, and 
               when he is nearly at the top:

               THE LADDER CRACKS as Price reaches the top and is helped to 
               safety. The Priest steadies the ladder now made unsafe and 
               clearly Claire wants to go onto the roof.

                                     PRIEST
                              (in Spanish)
                         No, please... it's not safe. You 
                         must come with me.

               Claire looks at Price -- she wants to go on the roof but the 
               sound of close gunfire settles the dilemma. Claire hurries 
               off to safety with the Priest.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE ROOFTOP OF THE CATHEDRAL OF LEON - LATE IN DAY

               THREE SANDINISTAS, PEDRO, AND PRICE EMERGE FROM A TUNNEL 
               onto a lower level of the cathedral rooftop where a body 
               lies. They are exposed immediately and automatic weapons 
               fire opens up on them -- the Sandinistas flatten against a 
               wall, quickly becoming separated from Price and Pedro.

               TWO SANDINISTAS RACE FOR COVER BEHIND A CUPOLA in a move 
               that is equally daring and foolish. The diversion draws fire 
               from the two soldiers.

               PRICE'S LIGHT METER IS INSTANTLY OUT TAKING READINGS as Pedro 
               huddles with him, curious at this strange act.

               TWO GUARDIA MOVE INTO POSITION TO FLUSH OUT THE SANDINISTAS 
               as they hide behind the cupolas. The hidden Third Guerrilla 
               opens fire killing a Guardia soldier, and the other soldier 
               races for the belltower. As he does:

               THE SANDINISTAS SEIZE THE MOMENT TO RUSH CLOSER, waving to 
               Pedro who slips along a wall with his bag of bombs.

               PRICE STARTS TO FOLLOW BUT IS PINNED DOWN BY FIRE and chooses 
               to take refuge halfway in an alcove. As fire from both sides 
               ricochets all over the rooftop, Price switches camera lenses 
               seemingly oblivious to the action.

               PEDRO MEETS ONE OF THE SANDINISTAS in a protected niche and 
               quickly they are unfolding his bag, setting the "muffin bombs" 
               out on the rooftop.

               THE OTHER TWO SANDINISTAS OPEN HEAVY FIRE and briefly draw 
               heavier fire from the belltower, as:

               PEDRO PICKS UP A MUFFIN weighing it briefly in his hand, 
               like a pitcher. He studies the surroundings -- runners on 
               first and third, no outs -- he spits in his left (his pitching 
               hand) and rubs it in casually.

               Pedro crosses himself, goes into an abbreviated pitching 
               motion, then rears and fires the 'muffin' toward the belltower 
               window, exposing himself as he does.

               AN EXPLOSION IN THE TOWER

               PEDRO THROWS ANOTHER INTO THE TOWER -- another explosion.

               A GUARDIA SOLDIER STAGGERS INTO THE WINDOW and a Sandinista 
               drops him with a shot.

               All is quiet.

               THE THREE SANDINISTAS CAREFULLY RUSH THE TOWER, looking in 
               and motion to Pedro and Price that all is okay, and as they 
               do:

               ANOTHER SHOT RINGS OUT -- they whirl around -- Pedro and 
               Price drop again. A lone Guardia soldier fires at them from 
               the other tower.

               A THIRD SANDINISTA DROPS HIM WITH A VOLLEY OF FIRE Again all 
               is quiet.

               PRICE FOLLOWS THE SANDINISTAS TO THE FIRST BELLTOWER and 
               looks in.

               FIVE BODIES LIE SCATTERED AND BLOODIED One of the Guerrillas 
               kicks a couple of them to make sure they are dead. In the 
               corner, one body lies on top of another. Satisfied, the 
               Sandinistas head for the other tower.

               PRICE STAYS BEHIND TO TAKE A FEW PICTURES and the ever-present 
               light meter appears, followed by several quick shots of the 
               bodies. Then Price goes to one of the arched, stone windows. 
               He looks out over the city.

               P.O.V. OF LEON -- DUSK Late in the afternoon now, the fighting 
               is over for the day. An occasional gunshot. Smoke rises from 
               scattered places throughout the city. There is new rubble. 
               The town is littered with bodies.

               P.O.V. THE RED CROSS WAGON MOVING THROUGH THE STREET

               A man walks in front of it, chanting slowly, rhythmically:

                                     RED CROSS MAN
                         Hay heridas o muertes aqui? Hay 
                         heridas o muertes aqui?
                              (Are there wounded or 
                              dead here?)

               We see a woman drag a body out into the street. The Red Cross 
               man makes small stacks of bodies. He douses the bodies with 
               gasoline and sets the pile aflame. Then continues.

                                     RED CROSS MAN
                         Hay heridas o muertes aqui?

               Price watches. He thinks he hears something, then dismisses 
               it. Something else. A voice, almost a whisper.

                                     VOICE
                         Price. You motherfucker, Price, I'm 
                         talking to you.

               He turns. One of the bodies speaks.

                                     VOICE
                         Where are those bastards... are they 
                         away?

               Price looks out -- the Sandinistas are on the other side of 
               the roof. This war gets stranger.

                                     PRICE
                         They're away.

               A body rolls out from under another body. Blood-splattered, 
               smiling, wiping the blood from his face. It is Oates, the 
               mercenary from Africa. He peeks out the window -- the 
               Sandinistas are on the other side of the roof. He whispers.

                                     OATES
                         What the fuck are you doing here?

                                     PRICE
                         What the fuck are you doing here?

               For a moment they understand that they are there for the 
               same reason -- they make their livings off war. Oates peeks 
               out the window nervously and repeatedly.

                                     OATES
                         Awright, awright -- you're lookin' 
                         good... how ya like Nicaragua?

               OATES readies his automatic weapon in case it's needed -- 
               routine. Price doesn't know how to answer.

                                     PRICE
                         It's beautiful.

               Oates laughs quickly and softly -- he is tuned into the 
               strangeness of Price's answer.

                                     OATES
                         Shitload o' greasers though, eh?

               P.O.V. THE SANDINISTAS HEADING BACK TOWARD US

               OATES AND PRICE SEE THEM, and Oates crawls back under the 
               pile of bodies.

               THE SANDINISTAS LOOK INTO THE BELLTOWER, all looks quiet, 
               and they motion to Price.

                                     SANDINISTA #1
                              (in Spanish)
                         It's getting late -- come on.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE FRONT OF THE CATHEDRAL - DUSK

               The Three Sandinistas, Pedro, and Price are hiding in the 
               shadows of the main church entrance. The Sandinistas are 
               carefully peeking around the corner, checking out the plaza. 
               It seems safe. The door opens; the Priest lets Claire out. 
               For a moment she looks around to see who's still alive -- in 
               the shadows Price looks like one of the Guerrillas. They see 
               each other and embrace briefly.

                                     CLAIRE
                         You're okay?

               The Sandinistas seem to relax. The Sandinistas take pride in 
               Pedro and pat his left arm for Price and Claire.

                                     SANDINISTA #1
                         San-dee Koufax, no?

                                     SANDINISTA #2
                         Si, Koufax.

                                     SANDINISTA #3
                         Es mejor que Koufax, eh?!

               They seem to want approval from the Americans.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Much better than Koufax.

               The Sandinistas slap hands, familiar with the American 
               gesture. The Six start walking across the plaza away from 
               the church. In the b.g. we see piles of bodies burning; the 
               Red Cross tends to the wounded locals. Spirits are high as 
               they walk. The tiny red light glows on Claire's recorder.

                                     PEDRO
                         Koufax is okay... but Tippy Martinez, 
                         he is the best... he pitches for the 
                         Baltimore Orioles, and some day I 
                         will be the second man from Nicaragua 
                         to play in the major leagues...

                                     SANDINISTA #1
                              (to Price and Claire)
                         Tippy Martinez had a good fastball, 
                         but Pedro has a curveball and a 
                         screwball that are better.

               All five of them agree that Pedro is the best; they slap his 
               valued arm and relax for the first time all day.

                                     PEDRO
                         You will give my autographed baseball 
                         to Tippy and tell him in five years 
                         I will be pitching with him, okay? 
                         He better watch out for me, eh?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ROOFTOP OF THE CATHEDRAL - DUSK

               OATES CHECKS THE CLIP ON HIS RIFLE and looks down into the 
               plaza.

               OATES P.O.V. TO THE SIX WALKING AWAY He doesn't smile or 
               joke -- it's all business.

               He aims the rifle.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE PLAZA - DUSK

                                     SANDINISTA #1
                              (in Spanish)
                         It's too dangerous to return to 
                         Managua at night. You should stay at 
                         the house of hammocks.

                                     CLAIRE
                              (in Spanish)
                         Gracias. Can they get into trouble 
                         for keeping us?

                                     PEDRO
                         No, no... you are not combatants.
                              (would rather talk 
                              baseball)
                         The Baltimore team is my team...

               A SHOT RINGS OUT, AND PEDRO'S CHEST EXPLODES in front of us. 
               Sudden panic, rage, confusion -- the Sandinistas whirl and 
               scan the building.

               P.O.V. OATES RACING ACROSS THE CATHEDRAL ROOFTOP into the 
               night.

               PRICE GRABS PEDRO'S GUN AND WHIRLS to face the church; his 
               action is instinctive, angry, and electric with energy.

               CLAIRE GRABS PEDRO'S ARM AND DRAGS THE BODY to safety, though 
               there is no safety and the body is lifeless. Her actions are 
               protective and automatic.

               THE SANDINISTAS TAKE CONTROL OF THE SITUATION and move 
               quickly. Two of them fan out to cover the escape. Price 
               screams in the direction of Oates,

                                     PRICE
                         You bastard!

               Claire drags the body near a bench under a tree.

                                     CLAIRE
                         What about him?!

                                     SANDINISTA #1
                              (dispassionately)
                         He's dead.

               The Sandinistas survey the cathedral and streets carefully, 
               warily, upset at their nonchalance. They know the sniper is 
               disappearing into the night, but they continue to look.

                                     SANDINISTA #1
                         I will talk to Pedro's mother. You 
                         must go to the house of the hammocks 
                         if you want to be safe.

               The Three Sandinistas fan out toward the church as it gets 
               dark.

               PRICE AND CLAIRE STAND NEXT TO PEDRO, feeling helpless and 
               ineffective. They both look at the body. Price realizes he's 
               holding Pedro's gun and places it down next to the body. 
               Price notices the tiny red light is still glowing on her 
               tape recorder. He points it out to Claire. She turns it off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE HOUSE OF HAMMOCKS - NIGHT

               IN A NEARLY DARK ROOM full of hanging hammocks, Claire sits 
               on the floor lit by a low wattage bulb hanging from a cord. 
               In another room through a door Price can be seen with a family 
               in the hammock workshop. Claire talks softly into her 
               recorder.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Hello sweetheart, this is your mother. 
                         I'm in Leon and I miss you. Don't 
                         worry about me -- it's not dangerous 
                         at all. I guess you can't believe 
                         what you hear on the news. I'll put 
                         this this tape in the mail when I 
                         get back to Managua, but knowing 
                         what the mail service is like, I may 
                         be home before it arrives. I think 
                         about you all the time and hope I 
                         can make it back before you graduate 
                         from Jr. High.

               As she speaks Price bids the family farewell and comes into 
               the room with Claire where he lies down in a hammock.

                                     CLAIRE
                         I love you and I'll finish this letter 
                         when I get back to the hotel.

               Claire lies down on a mat, exhausted, after turning out the 
               light. Several moments pass before Price speaks.

                                     PRICE
                         I know who shot Pedro. I knew somebody 
                         was in the tower.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Why didn't you tell the guerrillas?

                                     PRICE
                         I don't know... then they would've 
                         killed him I guess. I didn't want to 
                         interfere.

                                     CLAIRE
                         It wasn't an easy choice.

                                     PRICE
                         I think I made the wrong one.

               Silence.

                                     CLAIRE
                         You didn't take any pictures when it 
                         was over.

                                     PRICE
                         I didn't?

                         Is something happening to us?

                                     CLAIRE
                         Yes.

               Silence. They lie for a long time in the dark. A light in 
               the house is turned off. Finally:

                                     PRICE
                         Are you asleep?

                         No.

               Price gets out of the hammock and lies down next to her. 
               They don't speak. They kiss. She unbuttons his shirt. He 
               unbuttons her blouse. They undress just enough to begin making 
               love softly, quietly.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. PRICE AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - DAWN

               The first light of dawn strikes Claire's bare torso.

               PRICE'S LIGHT METER APPEARS AT HER BACK Price takes a reading, 
               then moves the meter to her neck, another reading. He moves 
               it down her nude body lit beautifully in the vague light, 
               partially covered with a blanket.

               He scurries across the room, stark naked, with a camera. 
               Price begins photographing her.

               He moves back to her and gently removes the blanket from the 
               rest of her body. His actions are quiet and easy. He stops 
               frequently to admire her.

               Claire lies sleeping nude, except for her socks. Price moves 
               around the room -- picture, picture, picture.

               CLAIRE WAKES UP SLOWLY and pulls the blanket back over her. 
               She opens her eyes and sees Price sitting in a chair several 
               feet away with his camera.

                                     PRICE
                         G'morning.

                         What are you doing?

                                     PRICE
                         You look beautiful.

               She realizes what he's been doing.

                                     CLAIRE
                         How long have you been doing this?

                                     PRICE
                         'Bout ten frames. Wait'll you see 
                         the pictures -- you look great.

               Her sense of violation is balanced by this notion. For a 
               moment we sense her attitude can go either way -- outrage or 
               some sense of being flattered, however ill conceived. She 
               chooses the latter.

                                     CLAIRE
                         I'll bet I look great -- give me the 
                         film.

                                     PRICE

                         I'll develop them myself -- give it 
                         to me or I'll start taping what you 
                         say in your sleep.

               Price hands her the film and climbs back under the blanket 
               with her.

                                     PRICE
                         I talk in my sleep?

                         Girl's names and F-stops. Terrible.

               They curl up together, holding onto each other. A small child 
               crosses the courtyard, peeking at them. A rooster crows.

                                     PRICE
                         Call the office. I don't want to go 
                         to work today.

               The peacefulness is shaken by the roar of an engine close 
               by.

               A HELICOPTER GUNSHIP PASSES OVER THE COURTYARD They look up, 
               jolted out of the moment. The war is back.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE OUTSKIRTS OF LEON - MORNING

               Price's rental car is a smoking wreck. He and Claire arrive 
               and she removes a single, feeble white flag that remains. 
               They study the car briefly and then turn as:

               A GUARDIA TROOP CARRIER LUMBERS past with a truckload of 
               refugees behind. They wave the flag and catch a ride with 
               the refugees.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FIFTH FLOOR OF INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL - DAY

               Alex comes out a door chatting with somebody, and passes a 
               mini-cam crew, old friends.

                                     ALEX

                         Half the press corps.

               A small laugh. They continue on. Alex enters Claire's room.

               INT. CLAIRE'S ROOM

               Alex enters. Nobody there. As he turns to leave he sees some 
               pictures in a stack of papers on her desk. He picks one up.

               CLOSE UP: A PICTURE OF CLAIRE SLEEPING IN LEON It's all over 
               and he knows it. He stares at, even admires, the image. He 
               puts it down and turns to leave as:

               CLAIRE ENTERS

                                     CLAIRE

                         Yeah... I'll bet... Claire...

               Alex finally acknowledges that it is over with Claire, but 
               refuses to say it directly.

                                     ALEX
                         I'm tired of Nicaragua.

                         right... everybody was right.

                         This is a face made for television.

                         You decided to go with the network.

               Alex nods, then seems to hit the end of his own resilience 
               and gets vitriolic.

                                     ALEX
                         Is he a good fuck?

                         Alex...

               In a simple monologue Alex goes from outrage to acknowledgment 
               of what he already knew.

                                     ALEX
                         That's a reasonable question for a

               EXT. THE MANAGUA AIRPORT - NEXT DAY

               A cab pulls up. Soldiers stand around everywhere. Price, 
               Claire, Alex, and the Cabbie get out. The cabbie takes his 
               bag.

                                     ALEX

                         there.

               Price pulls a bottle of wine from his camera bag and sets 
               three styrofoam cups on the cab roof. He hands the cork to 
               Alex and shows him the label.

               Alex does, and looks at the label.

               Awkward smile from Price.

                         You two wanta happy snap?

               Price makes the motion of taking a picture. They look at him 
               with affection, yet astounded again by his inappropriateness.

                                     ALEX
                         No happy snaps.

               He wanders away from the car to give them a moment alone, 
               and as he does he pulls the light meter from his pocket, 
               flipping it on and off nervously without looking at it. He 
               wanders idly toward a Guardia soldier. The soldier gets 
               nervous.

                                     ALEX
                         You're sure about him?

                         For the moment.

               Alex considers this -- he understands (whether he wants to 
               or not).

               THE SOLDIER COMES FACE-TO-FACE with PRICE, WHO BACKS OFF

                                     PRICE
                              (to soldier)
                         I'm a personal friend of Tacho's.
                              (smiles disarmingly)

               The soldier stops at Tacho's name. Price turns.

               P.O.V. ALEX AND CLAIRE KISSING GOODBYE

               PRICE TURNS AGAIN, embarrassed, faces the soldier.

                                     PRICE
                         Don't look, huh?
                              (beat)
                         No mire!

               The soldier, confused, turns away, and as he does:

               ALEX SLAPS PRICE ON THE SHOULDER, AND THEY TOO EMBRACE

                                     ALEX
                         Don't get hurt.

                                     PRICE
                         Ahh, I'm a chicken, don't worry.
                              (beat)
                         Alex, listen to me...

                                     ALEX
                         Yeah?

                                     PRICE
                         Within a year you're gonna be one of 
                         the "Ten Most Admired Men in America."

               Alex is amused, Price is serious. The cabbie comes out and 
               Alex heads into the airport.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SOMOZA'S COMPOUND - A PRESS LUNCHEON - DAY

               Daisy and her combo from the Viking Club perform "The Girl 
               From Ipanema" as ONE HUNDRED PRESS MEMBERS and V.I.P.'s sit 
               at long tables in the garden. The pleasantness of the 
               surroundings is countered by the presence of dozens of 
               SOLDIERS in the background, guarding the house, etc. Visible 
               at the head table are: TWO GENERALS AND THEIR WIVES, MRS. 
               SOMOZA, TWO WEALTHY BUSINESSMEN, MISS PANAMA IN A FLOPPY 
               HAT. Elsewhere mingling are: JAZY, ISELA, PRICE, REGIS. An 
               elaborate array of food sits on the table.

               INT. SOMOZA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Overlooking the gathering from his private living room, Somoza 
               grants Claire her interview. He close the window to muffle 
               the singing.

                                     CLAIRE
                         You're late to your own luncheon, 
                         Mr. President -- we can schedule 
                         this for another time.

                                     SOMOZA
                         Nonsense -- let them wait. We are a 
                         stunning couple, eh? My stomach is 
                         very flat -- I've been working out.

                                     CLAIRE
                         We are a stunning couple. Mr. 
                         President, you own one fifth of all 
                         the land in Nicaragua, you own the 
                         shipping port, the national airlines, 
                         the Mercedes dealership...

                                     SOMOZA
                         I am on a salt free diet...

               He takes her hand and leads her to two large portraits hanging 
               on a wall -- his parents.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Do you always hold hands with 
                         reporters?

                                     SOMOZA
                              (ignores her)
                         This is my mother and father. They 
                         were very special to me. Every Sunday 
                         morning I drive out to the cemetery 
                         and put flowers on their grave. I 
                         think people should know that.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Would you care to comment on the 
                         fall of Leon to the rebels?

               Somoza just smiles unaffected by her questions; she knows 
               the game is undaunted.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE LUNCHEON TABLES - DAY

               Hub Kittle is bending Price's ear in the crowd. Price seems 
               ammused and watches the anthem contest as he munches food.

                                     HUB
                         Listen, Russell, let's grow up. It's 
                         very easy to fall in love with the 
                         underdog, eh? But there's an upside 
                         and downside to this thing -- just 
                         wanta remind you... this stuff about 
                         a "Revolution of Poets" is crap.

                                     PRICE
                         But it's great P.R. So what's the 
                         upside?

                                     HUB
                         Simple. And it could happen. Somoza 
                         destroys the terrorist insurgents, 
                         rebuilds the country, shitcans the 
                         purveyors of excess, stabilizes the 
                         cordoba, and is finally beloved as 
                         the savior of Nicaragua.
                              (beat)
                         Our pal. Got a smoke?

               Price gives him a cigaret.

                                     PRICE
                         What's the downside?

                                     HUB
                         The Commies take over the world.

               It's simple, and Hub is pleased with his presentation. A 
               SOLDIER moves through the crowd looking quite out of place, 
               finds Hub and hands him a note. Hub reads it, seems delighted, 
               and excuses himself from the table.

                                     HUB
                         Excuse me, gentlemen, but the war 
                         may be over.

               Price and Regis look at each other strangely -- what's he 
               talking about? They shrug, Regis bites into a papaya, and 
               Hub hurries inside. Price and Regis watch the singer.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SECOND FLOOR OF SOMOZA'S HOUSE - DAY

                                     SOMOZA
                         My people love me. My stomach is 
                         flat. Did I say that already? No 
                         matter. It is flat.

                                     CLAIRE
                         There are reports that the Guardia 
                         operates a torture chamber at 
                         Coyotepe.

               Somoza ignores the question and reopens the window, flooding 
               the room with the Tony Bennett classic.

                                     SOMOZA
                         I like this song.

                         Since the earthquake in 1972 destroyed 
                         half of Managua, over three hundred 
                         million dollars in foreign relief 
                         aid have poured into the country, 
                         yet nothing has been re-built. It is 
                         said that the money has gone into 
                         your pocket.

                                     SOMOZA
                         I love the press, I really do. Some 
                         of my best friends are journalists.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Brazil, and 
                         Panama are reportedly on the verge 
                         of breaking off diplomatic relations 
                         with your regime. Would you comment?

               HUB KITTLE AND AN OFFICER BURST INTO THE ROOM interrupting 
               the interview. Something has happened. Somoza initially lashes 
               out at them -- the first time we've seen him lose his cool -- 
               then recovers.

                                     SOMOZA
                              (in Spanish)
                         I am busy! Get out of here at once 
                         or I'll put my foot up your ass!

               The OFFICER seems familiar with these tirades and grabs Somoza 
               by the arm, whispering into his ear. Somoza seems delighted 
               with the news and turns to Hub for confirmation. Hub nods.

                                     SOMOZA
                              (to Claire)
                         I'm sorry to have to conclude this 
                         most pleasant encounter, but something 
                         has happened.

               As Somoza leaves the room with the Officer and Hub, Hub turns 
               to Claire to squeeze in one final P.R. stroke.

                                     HUB
                         Did he tell you about his parents in 
                         the graveyard, the flowers and all 
                         that?
                              (she nods)
                         Good, good...

               Claire is left alone momentarily in Somoza's room. A soldier 
               enters and accompanies her outside to the luncheon.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE LUNCHEON - DAY

               As Claire comes outside, there is a flurry of activity at 
               the head table. TWO OFFICERS hastily set up an easel with a 
               large military-topographical map of Nicaragua. A SOLDIER 
               takes the microphone from the Singers -- the music grinds to 
               an inglorious halt -- and carries it to the head table.

               Price spots Claire and makes a "What's all this about?" 
               motion. Claire holds out her palms and shrugs -- she doesn't 
               know. All attention is quickly focused on the head table, 
               as:

               PRESIDENT SOMOZA MAKES A GRAND ENTRANCE FLANKED by Hub Kittle 
               and an Officer. He seems suddenly in unusually good spirits. 
               Hub taps the mike -- it works -- he motions for Somoza to 
               come forward.

                                     SOMOZA
                         My friends... this gathering was not 
                         intended to be a press conference as 
                         much as a... "get-together"... but I 
                         have just been handed a piece of 
                         news.

               Somoza plays the moment with theatrical elan.

                                     SOMOZA
                         Rafael is dead.
                              (beat)
                         He has been killed in an ambush in 
                         the Cordillera mountains of the 
                         Jinotega district.

               Somoza points to a spot on the map as do his Officer.

               THE PRESS TABLE IS SHAKEN FROM ITS NONCHALANCE and several 
               journalists immediately leap to their feet to question him.

                                     JOURNALISTS
                         Mr. President! Mr. President!

                                     SOMOZA
                         Please my friends -- no questions. A 
                         press release is being prepared.

               Somoza hands the mike to an aide who returns it to the music 
               stand. Almost immediately the music begins again.

               AT THE PRESS TABLE there is some confusion over the 
               announcement. Some journalists hurry off to file the story, 
               others just sit. Price seems alarmed by the announcement, 
               confused. Slightly wired, he listens to Regis and OTHER 
               JOURNALIST discuss it.

                                     OTHER JOURNALIST
                         They got Rafael? You believe that?

                         Every six months Tacho gives this 
                         speech -- maybe they finally lucked 
                         out.

               CLAIRE TRIES TO CORNER HUB KITTLE who is heading back inside. 
               Hub disappears inside, Claire pressing after him.

               JAZY APPROACHES PRICE and leans in as if sharing a confidence. 
               IN the b.g. the luncheon is breaking up.

                                     JAZY
                         Russell, excuse me... but I've just 
                         been put in a rather embarrassing 
                         position.
                              (hesitates)
                         Mrs. Somoza would like her picture 
                         taken with Miss Panama. In color?

               Price throws his camera bag over his shoulder, pulls out a 
               camera, and follows Jazy. They walk toward the head table.

                                     PRICE
                         How the hell could Tacho find Rafael.

                                     JAZY
                         Russell, please... I have my hands 
                         full...

               Mrs. Somoza and Miss Panama are waiting as Price and Jazy 
               arrive. Price is automatically switching camera lenses, but 
               he continues to grill Jazy.

                                     MRS. SOMOZA
                         Tacho, Tacho... venga, por favor!

               Price and Jazy exchange glances as Somoza reluctantly joins 
               the portrait.

               SOMOZA POSES WITH HIS WIFE AND HIS MISTRESS ON EACH ARM as 
               Price flashes a light meter under their noses, then backs 
               off to take the picture.

                         Everybody smile.

               Price takes a picture, Somoza wants to leave and Jazy would 
               just as soon have this awkward moment over with, but:

                         One more, please! Una mas, por favor?

               Reluctantly they pose again, and Price grills Jazy who is 
               trapped.

               Jazy moves Miss Panama slightly, returning to Price.

                         I thought you knew everything?

               As Somoza holds an interminable pose, Jazy launches into a 
               speech, keeping his voice low enough so Tacho cannot hear.

                                     JAZY
                         What do I know, eh? Tacho needs a 
                         victory very badly... he needs to 
                         prove to Jimmy Carter that he is 
                         still winning. He thinks Rafael's 
                         death is the proof he needs.

                         Carter don't need proof. He just 
                         sent twenty-five million in new arms 
                         to Tacho.

                         but whose fucking side are you on?

               Jazy and Price motion for the posers to move a step over.

               Inside the car are the British crew -- Regis drives -- and 
               Price and Claire.

               A city of about 50,000 located on the side of a hill. The 
               car pulls slowly into the base of the town into a clearing 
               with assorted vehicles -- Red Cross, La Guardia, Press. The 
               car moves slowly as its occupants survey the town, until it 
               pulls alongside a Red Cross truck that has broken down. Price 
               sticks his head out the window to ask instructions of a R.C. 
               WORKER.

               A gradual uphill grade -- the press car moves slowly. Guardia 
               are on both sides of the street, as the car stops at the 
               corner, directly beneath the sniper tower. They all look up.

                         Then let us out.

               The car stops, the door opens, and:

               A WALL NEARBY IS RIDDLED WITH BULLET HOLES AS THEY CLIMB 
               OUT, so they climb back in quickly.

                              (I'm sorry!)

               The soldier seems sincere, but they don't want to take a 
               chance.

                         Go one more block.

               THE CAR MOVES DEEPER INTO MATAGALPA, gradually moving among 
               tanquettas patrolling the streets, coming to a barricade 
               which they manuever past as Guardia soldiers look at them 
               strangely. The car turns around -- it has come too far.

               A GUARDIA OFFICER SIGNALS FOR THEM TO GET OUT but the idea 
               doesn't appeal to Regis and he whirls around, panicking 
               slightly, and heads off in the other direction.

               THE BARRICADE OFFICER SPEAKS IN A WALKIE TALKIE to a squadron 
               leader a couple of blocks away as the car approaches.

               THE SECOND OFFICER WHISTLES FOR THE CAR TO STOP but it speeds 
               up.

               THE OFFICER FIRES A PISTOL SHOT AT THE CAR SHATTERING THE 
               WINDSHIELD

               INSIDE THE CAR -- VISION IS BADLY IMPAIRED BY THE SHATTERED 
               GLASS and Regis panics, hitting the floorboard and the car 
               suddenly screeches around a corner, racing through Matagalpa. 
               The car squeals around corner after corner blindly, into:

               A GUARDIA BARRICADE AS A FUSILADE OF SMALL ARMS FIRE RINGS 
               OUT The windshield is totally destroyed now, and:

               THE OCCUPANTS OF THE CAR CROUCH LOW as the car races. Price 
               and Claire scream at Regis to stop, but it's too late.

               THE CAR SCREECHES INTO REVERSE as Regis tries to see out the 
               back window and Price, out of necessity operates the foot 
               pedal with his hand. The car smokes into an intersection and 
               sees:

               AN OPEN BLOCK AHEAD -- no Guardia are visible, so the car 
               races down the open block and as it comes to an intersection:

               A SHERMAN TANK COMES AROUND THE CORNER FACING US

               Several times larger than a tanquetta -- it dwarfs us and 
               everything around it. Its giant gun faces us head on.

               THE PRESS CAR SCREECHES TO A HALT, and everyone scrambles 
               out.

               The mini-cam equipment is dropped as the British crew 
               scrambles to safety against a building. Price and Claire end 
               up on opposite sides of the street.

               Silence -- the huge and silent tank is deciding what to do.

               THE TURRET SWINGS SEVERAL DEGREES TO ONE SIDE and lowers as 
               the scattered journalists freeze.

               A THUNDEROUS ROAR -- THE TANK DESTROYS THE CAMERA EQUIPMENT 
               leaving a huge crater and not a trace of the expensive qear.

               CLAIRE STARTS LAUGHING, FRIGHTENED, nervous and amused.

               PRICE TAKES PICTURES

               A WOMAN THROWS A CONTACT BOMB FROM A WINDOW AT THE TANK The 
               tiny bomb makes a pitiful explosion, hopelessly ineffective.

               THE TANK SWINGS ITS TURRET TOWARD THE HOUSE AND OPENS FIRE 
               and the wall of the house crumbles quickly as a family 
               scrambles to the rooftop of a neighboring house. Their house 
               is destroyed in a second.

               LA GUARDIA TROOPS APPEAR AND BEGIN FIRING TOWARDS Claire and 
               Price, who turn to see:

               SANDINISTA ARMY REGULARS RUNNING DOWN THE HILL alongside the 
               homemade local guerillas. This is the first time we've seen 
               the F.S.L.N. regular army in their camouflaged khaki dress.

               THE GUARD TAKES A POSITION TO FIGHT IT OUT and Claire and 
               Price are caught in a cross-fire, pinned to walls on each 
               street side.

               PRICE PUSHES THROUGH A DOOR TO SAFETY and looks back:

               CLAIRE IS TRAPPED OUTSIDE pounding on a door that doesn't 
               open. She tries another -- no luck. She curls up in a doorway 
               making herself as small as possible as bullets rip the wall 
               around her.

               AT THE TOP OF THE HILL, AN OLD BUS MOVES SLOWLY INTO THE 
               STREET

               Several youthful guerillas are pushing it.

               THE BUS COMES FLYING DOWN THE HILL TOWARD THE TANK Several 
               hundred feet away, it gathers speed toward us.

               INT. THE SPEEDING BUS

               A YOUTH at the wheel props a board under the steering wheel 
               and races to the back as ANOTHER YOUTH opens the door as the 
               bus races past Claire toward the tank.

               THE TWO YOUTHS LEAP OUT THE BACK DOOR where they tumble into 
               the dirt just before:

               THE BUS SMASHES INTO THE TANK AND EXPLODES

               GUARDIA SOLDIERS SHOOT THE TWO YOUTHS before they get away, 
               as:

               GUERILLAS APPEAR ON EVERY ROOFTOP opening heavy fire on La 
               Guardia.

               GUARDIA TROOPS RETREAT QUICKLY ON FOOT AND IN TANQUETTAS

               THE SHERMAN TANK TRIES TO DISLODGE ITSELF FROM THE BUS but 
               cannot, and drags the bus with it as it backs down the hill.

               PRICE RUNS OUT TO CLAIRE and huddles with her. She is shaken 
               but unhurt.

               SANDINISTAS ARE EVERYWHERE, moving into Matagalpa as Price 
               and Claire move past several bodies to higher ground.

               SANDINISTA BARRICADES ARE ON EVERY CORNER where women serve 
               food to their men. Claire and Price wander through, 
               momentarily disoriented. A small boy runs through the street 
               kicking a soccer ball, occasionally avoiding a body. He runs 
               right up to them and speaks.

                                     BOY

               They follow him up a hill.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MIDDLE-CLASS HOUSE OVERLOOKING THE CITY - DAY

               THE NEIGHBORHOOD IS TOTALLY SANDINISTA and several guerillas 
               are at the door. The boy speaks to one of the guards, and 
               they are admitted.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THEY ARE SEARCHED IMMEDIATELY, asked to put down their gear, 
               asked for credentials, and led down the hallway of a house 
               that is very American middle class.

               ANOTHER SOLDIER WITH RIFLE detains them momentarily before 
               showing them into a room used as a Revolutionary Command 
               office.

               ISELA STANDS IN MILITARY FATIGUES talking to her Sandinista 
               colleagues. Clearly she commands respect and makes decisions. 
               She finishes and turns to Claire and Price in a very 
               businesslike way, never acknowledging directly that they 
               have met before.

                                     ISELA
                         You are looking for Rafael?

               They are somewhat taken aback at her directness and 
               information.

                                     PRICE
                         Yeah. If it's possible.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Do you know why we're here... exactly?

                                     ISELA
                         Mr. Price doesn't do anything before 
                         announcing it first in the bar.
                              (beat)
                         It's a good story. You'll be more 
                         famous.

               EXT. A MOUNTAIN ROAD - LATER - DAY

               An old truck chugs up a series of cutbacks through rough 
               terrain. The truck has no hood, and a BOY sits on the fender 
               pouring oil from a series of Folgers cans into a funnel stuck 
               permanently into the engine. Underneath, dangling cans catch 
               the oil as it flows through. Price, Claire and FOUR ARMED 
               SANDINISTAS sit in the back. ISELA rides in front.

               THE TRUCK PASSES THROUGH A FRIENDLY GUERILLA ROADBLOCK

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. TOBACCO FIELDS IN REMOTE TERRAIN - DAY

               ISELA, CLAIRE, PRICE AND THE FOUR HIKE into increasingly 
               inaccessible terrain.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. RAFAEL'S CAMP - DUSK

               Heavily guarded but very mobile, the camp consists of perhaps 
               100 Soldiers, women preparing food, several tents. Price and 
               Claire attract attention as they enter.

               PRICE STOPS AND LOOKS AROUND THE CAMP CLOSELY seeming to 
               take it all in. He's been in many similar camps, countries, 
               wars.

               P.O.V. TWO SOLDIERS GUARDING THE ENTRANCE TO ONE TENT

                                     CLAIRE
                         Rafael's tent?

               Price doesn't answer but continues taking it all in, and 
               ISELA shouts to them to continue.

                                     ISELA
                         Venga, companeros.
                              (Come, comrades.)

               THEY CONTINUE INTO THE CAMP, BUT PRICE STOPS AGAIN Something 
               has caught him, his sixth sense, a feeling -- he refuses to 
               walk further for the moment. No glibness, just coolness.

                                     CLAIRE
                         What is it?

               Price looks around, speaks quietly.

                                     PRICE
                         Rafael is dead.

               Claire looks around quickly. There is no evidence to her.

                                     PRICE
                         I can smell it.

                         I don't know.

                                     ISELA
                              (slightly exasperated)
                         Venga por favor! Alli!

               They continue into the camp -- now Claire looks around 
               nervously. Price mutters a half laugh, softly and strangely, 
               as they are led to a makeshift table and offered food. In 
               the b.g. Isela enters one of the tents.

               PRICE AND CLAIRE SIT DOWN TO EAT and Price continues scanning 
               the camp as they talk.

                                     CLAIRE
                         What're you talking about?

                                     PRICE
                         He's dead. I know it.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Then why did they bring us all the 
                         way here to see him?

               He doesn't know.

               P.O.V. FOUR FIGURES/CONFERRING IN FRONT OF A TENT Isela 
               emerges and joins them. The others are: THE PRIEST FROM LEON, 
               A BUSINESSMAN WHOM WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE FROM EARLIER SCENES, 
               AND COMMANDANTE CINCO, dressed in camouflaged khaki.

               ISELA WALKS OVER TO CLAIRE AND PRICE after talking with the 
               others. She brings COMMANDANTE CINCO with her. They sit down.

                                     ISELA
                         This is Commandante Cinco.

               They all shake hands.

               Isela begins at once.

                                     ISELA
                         Today we took Matagalpa. Leon is 
                         about to fall, and Masaya. And next 
                         week we could be in Managua but it 
                         is still possible to lose.

                         must know that Rafael is alive and 
                         well.

                                     COMMANDANTE CINCO

                         Come with us.

               THEY ALL RISE AND HEAD TOWARDS RAFAEL'S TENT

               INT. RAFAEL'S TENT

               The tent is filled with Sandinista officers and soldiers 
               standing and sitting around.

               RAFAEL'S BODY LIES ON A TABLE The shirtless upper torso 
               propped slightly upright, still wearing glasses, the figure 
               of Rafael is distinctly non-heroic. He is slightly overweight, 
               slightly balding, but as he lies there surrounded by his 
               men, the the glow of lanterns, he looks almost alive.

               Price and Claire look at each other.

                                     COMMANDANTE CINCO
                         Usted es un fotografo magnifico.
                              (beat)
                         Queremos que vive.
                              (You are a great 
                              photographer. Make 
                              him alive.)

               Price laughs -- the request is ridiculous.

                                     ISELA
                              (to Claire)
                         Why is he laughing?

                                     PRICE
                         You're crazy.

               Cinco steps forward -- his presence commands attention. His 
               delivery is forceful but not emotional. As he begins to speak, 
               Price stops laughing.

                                     CINCO
                              (in Spanish)
                         We have momentum, but many more lives 
                         will be lost. Even Washington is 
                         starting to admit that the butcher 
                         Somoza is not loved by his people. 
                         They have detained twenty-five million 
                         dollars in new arms shipments for 
                         Somoza at an airfield in Florida 
                         until they find out if Rafael is 
                         alive or dead. We know about these 
                         things.

               He pauses briefly.

                                     CLAIRE
                         If Washington thinks Rafael is dead, 
                         they will ship the arms to Somoza. 
                         Do you understand.

                                     PRICE
                         Yeah.

                         Commandante... Soy un periodista.

               CINCO attacks that defense with new vigor.

                                     CINCO
                         This has nothing to do with journalism -- 
                         there is more to the world than 
                         journalism. We are going to end this 
                         war with you or without you.
                              (beat)
                         People don't really believe in Rafael -- 
                         they believe in the idea of Rafael, 
                         no? Because for now the idea of Rafael 
                         is enough for the people of Nicaragua. 
                         When the war is over -- none of this 
                         matters.

               PRICE hesitates, his manner devoid of its usual cockiness.

                                     PRICE
                         I don't do things... like this.

                                     CINCO
                         Enough lives have been lost already.
                              (beat of empathy)
                         It's difficult, I know -- but you 
                         must do it.

               COMMANDANTE CINCO PLACES AN ARM ON PRICE'S SHOULDER and speaks 
               in broken English.

                                     CINCO
                         In the morning, eh? When there's 
                         better light!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PRICE AND CLAIRE'S TENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

               Price lies on his back on a table. Claire sits in a chair, a 
               lantern is on the table. His reclining body is not unlike 
               Rafael's. He plays with a camera without looking at it, 
               turning it slowly, removing and replacing a lens. He's never 
               been this calm, this unmoving.

               Claire, however, moves around the tent like a caged animal -- 
               like Price normally is. She smokes. She's nervous and wired.

                                     CLAIRE
                         I spend my whole life separating how 
                         I feel from how I think and what I 
                         see from what I say -- that's called 
                         journalism, isn't it?

               He nods slightly.

                                     CLAIRE
                         It's disciplined. It civilized. It 
                         involves distinctions. I'm great at 
                         distinctions. I wish I wasn't so 
                         good at them. Sometimes I envy you -- 
                         you don't make any -- it's very 
                         convenient.
                              (beat)
                         The only time I don't worry about 
                         all those things is when I'm with my 
                         daughter.

                                     PRICE
                         Or when you're in bed.

                         Yes!

                              direction)
                         My job is to find a story, then tell 
                         a story -- whatever it is -- because 
                         I believe that if enough people hear 
                         enough stories then somehow, through 
                         information alone, we all have a 
                         better chance to survive.

                         That's a very romantic streak I have 
                         running through me -- maybe it's a 
                         weakness. Information is good -- 
                         lack of information is bad. Simple, 
                         eh?

                                     PRICE
                         Not so simple.

                         You take that picture you'll take it 
                         for all the right reasons -- I 
                         understand.

                                     PRICE
                         I'm not gonna take it.

               He fiddles with the cameras.

                                     CLAIRE
                         That's fine for you. But do I go 
                         back and say I interviewed Rafael? 
                         Do I go back and say I missed the 
                         biggest story of the war? Or do I 
                         say Rafael was stone cold dead --

                         fell in love with the querillas 
                         because their cause was...

               Silence.

               Silence.

                                     CLAIRE
                         I want this war to end.
                              (beat)
                         I'm not going to tell the world that 
                         Rafael is dead.

               Silence. Claire lies down on the cot. Exhausted but high. 
               Price gets off the table and goes to her.

                                     PRICE
                         I love you.

                                     CLAIRE
                         I think I love you.

                                     PRICE
                         Don't think so much.

               He gets on the cot with her. They kiss deeply, passionately, 
               and begin making love.

               EXT. THE CAMP - FIRST LIGHT OF DAWN

               THE CAMP IS COMING TO LIFE as the flap opens on Price's tent 
               and he looks out. He raises his camera and starts taking 
               pictures of:

               PRICE RISES AND LOOKS AROUND THE CAMP, wandering over to a 
               large can where he drinks some water.

               CLAIRE EMERGES FROM THE TENT and watches Price head over to 
               a shaded area with his cameras.

               CLAIRE'S P.O.V. OF PRICE AS HE MOVES THROUGH A GROUP OF 
               SANDINISTAS GATHERED AROUND A TABLE

               Their backs are toward us as he adjusts seating positions 
               and rearranges items that have been provided for the table.

               He takes a light reading and moves quickly into position. 
               Price raises his camera.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               They sit at a table studying a map, a copy of La Prensa is 
               displayed -- the headlines declare that RAFAEL IS DEAD and 
               featuring a photo of Somoza at the luncheon as he points to 
               a map of the country. For an instant Rafael looks alive -- 
               FREEZE FRAME.

               EXT. THE ROAD BLOCK TO MANAGUA - LATER

               Price and Claire are sitting on top of a Red Cross truck as 
               it heads through Sebaco. Soldiers from La Guardia are 
               everywhere. As the truck moves through the village, something 
               catches Price's eyes:

               OATES STANDS AGAINST A WALL IN COMMAND OF A SQUADRON Two 
               whores and several troops sit against a wall. As the truck 
               passes, Oates waves casually, with emotion.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. PRICE'S HOTEL BATHROOM IN MANAGUA - DAY

               Red light in the bathroom as Price pulls several photo prints 
               from the bath and plasters them wet against the mirror.

               PHOTO OF RAFAEL IN THE CAMP, and he looks very much alive. 
               He pulls more shots from the bath: THE PRIEST FROM LEON, THE 
               BUSINESSMAN, COMMANDANTE CINCO AND ISELA. He dries them off 
               and hides them with their negatives under a pile of equipment.

               He picks up the shot of Rafael and leaves.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SOMEWHERE IN MANAGUA

               A group of muchachos in masks, baseball caps, and bandanas 
               race through the streets carrying a photo blow-up of Rafael.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. JAZY'S HOUSE

               The newspaper headline sits on Jazy's desk as Jazy studies 
               it unemotionally. We hear Miss Panama's voice:

                                     MISS PANAMA
                         Marcel!

               He spins on his chair as she glides in modeling a new dress. 
               She spins magically for him -- he blows her a kiss.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LUSH RIVER VALLEY OF NICARAGUA - DAY

               A small private plane flies through a canyon, dwarfed by the 
               spectacular landscape. Hub Kittle works the room.

               INT. THE PLANE - DAY

               Two MASKED GUERILLAS hold a gun to the head of a pilot. A 
               large sack is crammed into the tiny compartment with them.

               EXT. A SMALL MOUNTAIN TOWN IN NICARAGUA - DAY

               The plane flies in low over the town and suddenly:

               THE SKY IS FILLED WITH LEAFLETS that flutter to the ground. 
               Townspeople, bewildered at first, pick up the papers to see:

               CLOSE UP -- PRICE'S PHOTOGRAPH OF RAFAEL ALIVE

               LOCAL RESIDENTS RAISE THEIR FISTS IN SALUTE to the plane as 
               it disappears into the mountains.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE ROOFTOP GARDEN OF THE INTERCONTINENTAL - DAY

               Journalists are gathered to watch the fighting which is now 
               on the outskirts of Managua. Price stands to the side casually 
               taking pictures of Journalists taking pictures of the war. 
               Hub Kittle floats around providing drinks and P.R.

               P.O.V. A PUSH-PULL AIRPLANE MAKES BOMBING PASSES on the 
               capitol. Columns of smoke rise throughout the city.

               REGIS MOVES HIS MINI-CAM CREW INTO POSITION AT THE RAIL

                              slightly)
                         We got the smoke.

                                     REGIS
                         Roll it...

               CLAIRE STANDS TO THE OTHER SIDE with binoculars watching. 
               She accepts a drink from Hub and speaks into her tape deck.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Under a steel gray July sky... start 
                         again... under a gray steel Managuan 
                         sky... scratch it... In an 
                         extraordinary development in Managua, 
                         President Anastazio Somoza has ordered 
                         the Air Force to begin bombing his 
                         own capitol, under a sky... fuck 
                         it...

               She fires down the drink and puts down the mike. She picks 
               up the binoculars again and, glancing below, is shocked:

               P.O.V. BELOW -- ALEX GETS OUT OF A CAB WITH HIS SUITCASES

               He starts into the hotel, glances up, and they see each other.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Oh my God...

               Price sees Alex at the same time. Alex waves to both of as 
               he heads into the hotel. Price and Claire look at each other.

               Claire sits down at a table, stunned to see Alex. Price 
               commandeers a waiter and joins her with a fresh tray of 
               drinks.

                                     CLAIRE
                         A Scotch, please...
                              (he nods)
                         Double.

               Price joins her as other journalists jockey for position at 
               the railing. He is equally upset and confused.

                                     PRICE
                         What's he doing here?

                                     CLAIRE
                         I have no idea.

               ALEX COMES THROUGH THE DOOR with a couple journalists, sees 
               Price and Claire and comes over to join them. A polite kiss 
               on Claire's cheek, a handshake for Price. A moment of 
               awkwardness.

                                     ALEX
                         Congratulations.

                         On what?

                                     ALEX
                         On what?! The Washington Post, the 
                         Times, networks, wire services -- 
                         everybody's picked up the picture.

                                     PRICE
                         Fabulous.

               Unsure silence.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Why are you back?

                                     ALEX
                         I came back because of Russell.

                                     PRICE
                         Because of me?

                                     ALEX
                         Yeah... the whole fucking East Coast 
                         is falling in love with Rafael -- 
                         they were sure he was dead this time. 
                         Somebody wants to do a musical about 
                         him and his mug's on every T-shirt 
                         in Central Park.

               Alex enjoys the lunatic mixture of politics and popular 
               culture.

                                     ALEX
                         I think he's bigger than Farrah 
                         Fawcett.

               Claire and Price struggle to enjoy this supremely 
               uncomfortable moment. It's not easy to enter the game. Claire 
               attempts to change the subject.

                                     CLAIRE
                         You look good. Things're okay?

                                     ALEX
                         I'm happier in New York, sure, things 
                         are great. You guys?

                                     PRICE
                         Terrific... now... I'm a little slow 
                         here, Alex... what exactly did you 
                         come back for?

               No more games. Alex addresses Price with conviction.

                                     ALEX
                         It's a great story.
                              (beat)
                         I want to talk to Rafael... and you're 
                         the only man in the world that can 
                         take me to him.

               Price's and Claire's hearts sink. They look at each other. 
               Alex, despite his reluctance to return to Nicaragua, seems 
               genuinely enthused about the possible story. Before Price or 
               Claire respond, Hub Kittle notices Alex and comes over with 
               a tray of drinks, extending genuine greetings to the Senior 
               Correspondent.

                                     HUB
                         Alex! Couldn't stay away, eh?

               The fresh round of drinks are put on the table. The sound of 
               bombs ripping the capitol are the only thing we hear.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CLAIRE'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Claire and Price now have adjoining rooms. She is staring 
               out the window as he comes in. The mood is strained.

                                     CLAIRE
                         We've got to tell Alex what happened.

                                     PRICE
                         No way.

                                     CLAIRE
                         I'll tell him. He deserves to know.

                                     PRICE
                         We don't owe him anything!

                         and made excuses for your 
                         unprofessional attitude before the 
                         world fell in love with your

                         they could to interview bullets and

                         Matagalpa -- the Guardia heavily 
                         control the area and they're scared 
                         right now -- they'll never let us 
                         through. We won't be able to get 
                         near Rafael. Alex will understand --

               Price's white flagged newly rented press car streaks along, 
               overtaking an ox cart. A guardia convoy is going the opposite 
               direction, back toward Managua. Alex looks out of the car 
               with interest--he hasn't been to the front line for several 
               wars.

                         I've got supreme confidence in you.

               A car is on fire by the side of the road. Price flies past; 
               Alex watches curiously. Several people stand around the car.

                                     ALEX
                         Claire looks good, eh?

                         Everybody looks good in the tropics.

               Alex isn't sure how to respond to this curious reply.

                                     ALEX
                         Since I haven't been able to find 
                         Isela since coming back, you're going 
                         to have to translate for me -- what 
                         the hell does that mean?

               Price is nervous, wired, on edge.

                                     PRICE
                         Alex... I love her.

               Alex takes this calmly -- it's not exactly new information.

                                     ALEX
                         And she 'thinks' she loves you.

                                     PRICE
                         It's past the thinking stage.

               Alex looks at the passing scenery -- he's in no hurry.

                                     ALEX
                         I'd like to know something -- it

                         final scheme of things... but I'm

                         Alex -- we're friends!

               There is something desperate in his voice.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. A ROADBLOCK ON THE EDGE OF SEBACO - DAY

               Price and Alex are ordered out of their car by a very 
               unfriendly Guardia soldier. He is ordered to put down his 
               camera bag. The hood and trunk are opened.

                                     SOLDIER
                         Venga.

               They are led to a shed by the roadside, A TIRE REPAIR SHOP, 
               where they sit down in an oily, dusty shack. They watch the 
               soldiers:

               P.O.V. THE SOLDIERS TEARING UP THE RENTAL CAR, pulling off 
               door panels, looking for weapons.

                                     ALEX
                         I bet you go through a few rental 
                         cars.

                                     PRICE
                         Don't worry. I put this in your name.

               PRICE AND ALEX JERK TO LIFE at the sound of screaming in the 
               distance. A volley of gunfire follows. Price moves quickly 
               into an adjoining shed and looks through a crack in the wall:

               P.O.V. AN EXECUTION SQUAD IN A FIELD as several bodies are 
               being hauled away. Two soldiers reload their guns. PAN to a 
               figure moving behind a wall -- OATES.

               PRICE HURRIES THROUGH THE SHACKS TOWARD THE EXECUTION WALL 
               as Alex calls to him and hurries after -- Price is single-
               minded. As he moves through the shacks we hear another volley 
               of fire, and Price bursts into a clearing to see:

               TWO TRUCKS BEING LOADED WITH BODIES AS OATES SUPERVISES. 
               PRICE STEPS INTO THE CLEARING -- FACE-TO-FACE WITH OATES.

               They look at each other for several beats before anyone 
               speaks. Oates is slightly embarrassed.

                                     OATES
                         No pictures, eh? Might look bad.

               Oates smiles half-way; Price looks around at the bodies.

                                     PRICE
                         You get paid by the body or by the 
                         hour?

                                     OATES
                         I get paid the same way you do. What 
                         the fuck you doin' in Sebaco -- this 
                         place's about to blow... ain't it?

                                     PRICE
                         You didn't have to nail Pedro.

                                     OATES
                         Who's Pedro?

               Alex arrives and tries to pull Price back -- at the same 
               time he sees the bodies and is sickened at the sight.

                                     ALEX
                         Oh my God...

               A body is carried through and loaded on a truck. Oates's 
               tone is one of explanation rather than defense, very matter-
               of-fact.

                                     OATES
                         There's a motherfucking war goin' 
                         on, pal... lotta sad stories.

               Price mumbles and wanders to the next truck a few feet away, 
               and as he sees it he stops short, speechless. He points:

               THE BODIES OF THE PRIEST FROM LEON AND THE BUSINESSMAN, 
               figures we saw at Rafael's camp, sit in the back of the truck. 
               They are splattered with blood and lifeless. Price is shaken.

                                     PRICE
                         Why them? Why them?!

               Oates has to look to see who he's talking about, and Price 
               loses his cool.

                                     PRICE
                         You're a cocksucker!

                                     OATES
                         I don't suck no dick, man...

               PRICE GRABS OATES AND PUSHES HIM BACKWARDS but Oates responds 
               like an animal. The two men go down in a heap and lash out 
               at each other in the dust. Their fighting is largely 
               ineffective, though very physical, until Oates asserts himself 
               and knocks Price against a wall, breaking free to pick up 
               his automatic rifle that he handles with one hand and shoves 
               it into Price's face.

                                     OATES
                         I'd prefer not splattering your brains

                         Them? C'mere. You too.

               He leads them under an awning nearby where a couple soldiers 
               sit. A small table, some weapons, two shallow boxes, food, 
               beer. Oates rummages around to find what he wants, and pulls 
               out:

               A HANDFUL OF PHOTOGRAPHS, mostly snapshots, odd sizes, with 
               names written on them. He sifts through them quickly and we 
               see an assortment of photographs of Nicaraguans. He finds 
               what he's looking for and holds up:

               PRICE'S PHOTOGRAPH OF THE PRIEST AND THE BUSINESSMAN, the 
               picture taken in Rafael's camp, blown up, cropped, and 
               identified. The faces are circled.

                         Sebaco... I owe yer ass.

               This information hits Price in the gut, and he is seized 
               with fear.

                                     ALEX

                         that dumb.

               Price turns, he doesn't want to face it.

                                     ALEX

                         but I heard he gets 'em from a Frog.

               Oates pulls another picture from a different box and holds 
               it up:

               Silence. The car races.

               Alex doesn't force the issue, nor does he understand it

                         What about Rafael?

               No answer -- the car races back to Managua. Alex stares at 
               Price trying to figure out what is wrong.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PRICE'S ROOM AT THE INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL - LATER

               A MAID IS CLEANING HIS ROOM which is the usual disaster. 
               Price enters, just returned, and quickly looks for his 
               negatives under the equipment where he had hidden them.

                                     PRICE

                              here. Photographs.)

                              (in Spanish)
                         Everything's always a mess here. You 
                         should be neater.

                         Negativos, negativos!

               The maid shrugs -- Price is crazy anyway, and:

               CLAIRE WALKS INTO THE ROOM She too looks shaken. He looks 
               up.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Commandante Cinco's body was just 
                         found on the road to Matagalpa.

               The maid starts crying. They look at her helplessly as she 
               sobs, 'Cinco, Cinco...'

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREETS OF MANAGUA - DAY

               A cab takes them through the increasingly nervous city. La 
               Guardia troop trucks are everywhere -- things seem more 
               hurried. A hunting rifle sits in the cabbie's lap. They get 
               out and knock on Jazy's door.

               GUARDIA SOLDIERS WATCH THEM FROM A DISTANCE, a development 
               that Price and Claire are aware of.

                                     CLAIRE
                         I don't think it's Jazy.

               Still no answer.

                                     PRICE
                         Oates said it was a Frog. How many 
                         Frenchmen you know around here? Jazy 
                         ain't 'facilitating' shit.

               Price is impatient. He looks around nervously -- the Guards 
               are out of view -- and he slides a knife into the latch, 
               jimmying the lock. The door opens slowly -- an alarm goes 
               off.

               Price and Claire duck inside quickly.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Christ!

               Price, momentarily comfortable with the danger, responds 
               quickly and finds the alarm wire running along the door jamb.

               LA GUARDIA TROOPS NEARBY HEAR THE ALARM and head toward 
               Jazy's.

               INSIDE THE HOUSE PRICE FINDS THE ALARM BOX which he pries 
               open and expertly pulls two wires. The alarm stops.

               Immediately they begin going through drawers and cupboards. 
               She pulls out some harmless snapshots of Miss Panama, replaces 
               them.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Are we looking for negs or prints?

                                     PRICE
                         Anything.

               They find nothing downstairs. The look up at the sound of 
               distant gunfire.

               Suddenly: Loud banging at the front door -- La Guardia.

               EXT. TWO GUARDIA SOLDIERS AND A THIRD ARRIVING - DAY

               They look around warily, hungrily -- they know something is 
               wrong.

               BACK INSIDE THE HOUSE we hear the shouting soldiers, banging. 
               Price and Claire look at each other, and the camera bag. 
               Claire points upstairs to Price, to the door for herself. 
               Russell grabs the bag and bounds quickly upstairs. Claire 
               goes to the front door, shaking nervously.

               CLAIRE OPENS THE DOOR AND FACES THE SOLDIERS

                                     CLAIRE
                         Que quiere?
                              (What do you want?)

                              (A girlfriend of his.)

               The soldiers look at each other curiously and push open the 
               door to look in the house without entering -- respectful of 
               Jazy.

                                     SOLDIER #2
                         El hombre tiene muchas novias, eh?
                              (The man has many 
                              girlfriends, no?)

               The soldiers laugh and peer into the room. Claire forces the 
               door closed on them, teasing slightly.

                                     CLAIRE
                         No, no, no...

               Afraid to make a mistake with one of Jazy's sweethearts, 
               they don't press the issue. The door closes shut.

               INT. THE HOUSE

               CLAIRE sighs with frightened relief and hurries upstairs to 
               join Price.

               JAZY'S BEDROOM as she enters. A rumpled bed, a spilled wine 
               glass -- a pleasant mess.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Russell?
                              (no answer)
                         Russell?

               A door off the bedroom is open -- light spills out. Claire 
               stops cold at what she sees:

               PRICE STANDS IN A ROOM FULL OF PHOTOGRAPHS Hundreds of 
               pictures of all sizes, photographic equipment, an enlarger, 
               cameras and lenses, etc. Pictures of Sandino, newspaper 
               photos, snapshots.

               P.O.V. OF RUSSELL'S PHOTOGRAPHS FROM RAFAEL'S CAMP cropped 
               and blown up -- Commandante Cinco, the Priest of Leon, the 
               Businessman, Isela. Photographs of other slain rebel leaders. 
               The pictures include faces that have been circled with names 
               written in -- exactly as in the pictures Oates possessed.

               They are both stunned.

                                     PRICE
                         Let's get out of here.

               THEY HURRY DOWNSTAIRS and as they get to the front door -- 
               the sound of somebody opening it. They freeze.

               THE DOOR OPENS AND MISS PANAMA ENTERS She smiles and greets 
               them in a friendly, aloof manner, and continues toward the 
               waterless pool.

                                     MISS PANAMA
                         Hola.

               Price and Claire return the greeting and continue out the 
               door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. JAZY'S HOUSE - THE SOUND OF MORTAR IN THE DISTANCE

               As they emerge, Claire tears a white cloth in half and ties 
               it to a stick, handing half to Price who does likewise.

               An earth mover goes past, a Guardia soldier at the wheel. 
               More soldiers cling to the machine, their guns at the ready.

                                     PRICE
                         We've got to talk to Alex.

               They start walking.

                         You think our flags are big enough?

               Flags held high, they move nervously down the street into 
               the ominous silence of the city.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREETS OF MANAGUA - NIGHT

               Alex, Price, and Claire get out of a cab and approach a large 
               statue of Somoza on horseback, surreally lit by floodlights 
               in the center of a traffic circle. Four Guardia Soldiers are 
               visible on the sidewalk in the b.g. drinking with two women.

                                     PRICE
                         This is what I want to show you.

                         We drove through three roadblocks a 
                         half hour before curfew so you could 
                         show me a statue of Tacho.

                                     PRICE
                         It's not Tacho. It's Mussolini. Tacho 
                         went to Italy to commission a statue 
                         of himself, he found a warehouse 
                         full of Il Duces on horseback, got a 
                         great deal on one of 'em -- brought 
                         it back and switched heads.

                         Ya can't tell, can ya?

               Silence. Alex knows Price too well -- it's a great story but 
               that's not why they're here.

                                     ALEX
                         What the hell are you talking about?

                         I think what he's trying to say -- 
                         what we're trying to say -- is that 
                         things aren't exactly what they seem 
                         to be.

                         What are we doing here?

               Silence. Claire addresses Alex calmly.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Rafael is dead.

               Silence. Alex isn't quite sure he understood.

                         Who cares how?!

               Silence. A bit of gallows laughter from Alex as he circles 
               the statue. Price calms and tries to explain.

                                     CLAIRE
                         I'd do it again.

               Alex lets it all sink in. These two people about whom he has 
               such passionate feelings have totally exposed themselves to 
               him.

                                     ALEX
                         You two have, of course, just served 
                         me up your balls -- if that's what 
                         they're called -- on a platter.
                              (several beats)
                         I can bury you both. You're handing 
                         me your careers.

               They don't respond -- he's right.

                                     ALEX
                         Well, Jesus Christ... this is a 
                         motherfucking story, Russell...
                              (long silence)
                         What am I supposed to do with it?

                                     CLAIRE
                         Anything you want.

               Small, tired gallows laughter from Alex. There is a long 
               silence before Alex speaks, aware of the irony.

                                     ALEX
                         They're holding the lead in the World 
                         section for Rafael.

                                     PRICE
                         It's great stuff, isn't it? We'd go 
                         down in a blaze of glory.

                                     ALEX
                         Oh yeah...
                              (distraught)
                         I don't know what to do.
                              (beat)
                         I've gotta take some kind of a story 
                         back with me. Maybe Jazy, eh?

                                     CLAIRE
                         Oh Jesus.

                                     PRICE
                         It's a little dangerous looking for 
                         Jazy at the moment.

                                     ALEX
                              (mock heroic)
                         Ah, danger -- I love it. You could 
                         ask the pointy-shoed little bastard 
                         about your pictures... and I could 
                         ask him whatever happened to Isela.

                                     CLAIRE
                         She's an officer in the Rafael army -- 
                         we saw her in Matagalpa.

               Alex is surprised slightly, but takes pleasure in revealing 
               it.

                                     ALEX
                         You mean I slept with a Sandinista?

               Price and Claire exchange glances. Alex is dead serious.

                                     ALEX
                         I guess Rafael is alive, eh?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CLAIRE'S ROOM - NIGHT

               PRICE AND CLAIRE LIE IN BED sweating. A siren and distant 
               mortar can be heard outside. Price goes to the window and 
               shuts it -- the room is quieter and hotter. He pounds a broken 
               air conditioning duct.

                                     PRICE
                         Damn air conditioning.

               He looks out the window -- it never used to be this 
               complicated.

                                     CLAIRE
                         I wish I was home.

               Silence.

                         C'mere.

               She goes to him, lies down, and they embrace.

                         Do you think it's almost over?

               A loud, long burst of automatic weapons fire is heard 
               somewhere outside. Their eyes are open as they hold onto 
               each other.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE STREETS OF MANAGUA - NEXT MORNING

               A sense of foreboding. Heavy road equipment prowls the street 
               looking for Rebel barricades to destroy. Tanquettas and 
               Guardia everywhere.

               The flag draped press car of Price and Alex drives slowly.

               P.O.V. OUT OF THE CAR AS THEY LOOK CAREFULLY Things feel 
               wrong. Guardia barricades are everywhere, forcing them to 
               follow a route they might not choose. The Guardia soldiers 
               at the barricades seem on edge. When Jazy's house is visible 
               in the distance, barricades force them another direction.

               GUARDIA SOLDIERS RACE DOWN A STREET TOWARD GUNFIRE and the 
               car stops. When the road is clear it creeps into an 
               intersection. They check their position.

               THE CAR CREEPS TO A STOP and they look around further.

               A PIG CROSSES THE STREET 100 YARDS AWAY AND IS SHOT BY A 
               SOLDIER.

               Everything is wrong. Price looks around restlessly.

                                     PRICE
                         Alex... let's go back.

                                     ALEX
                         Jazy's probably sitting in the bar 
                         laughing at us. Which way's the hotel?

                                     PRICE
                         I don't know.

               A WOMAN PEEKS OUT OF A DOORWAY WATCHING

                                     ALEX
                         I'll ask her... be right back.

                                     PRICE
                         Just a sec'... take a flag.

               But Alex is out of the car at once, approaching the woman.

               Alex motions that "it's not necessary" and talks to the woman. 
               We can't hear, but she points down the block.

               INSIDE THE CAR Price cranks film into place, his actions are 
               automatic and nervous. When he looks up:

               P.O.V. ALEX FIFTY YARDS AWAY

               Walking in the direction she pointed, he motions to Price as 
               if to say, "Just checking this out."

               PRICE LOOKS AROUND NERVOUSLY FOR A SENSE OF DIRECTION And as 
               he does, looks through the camera.

               THROUGH CAMERA P.O.V. OF THE DEAD PIG followed by quick 
               blurred pans to other images -- TANK, HOUSE, WOMAN, SOLDIER -- 
               until it settles on ALEX IN THE INTERSECTION. Two Guardia 
               soldiers come up to him and he holds out his hands as if to 
               say, "I'm lost."

               ALEX TALKS TO THE SOLDIERS -- FREEZE FRAME click, click -- 
               and the whirring sound of a motor drive, another FREEZE FRAME 
               click, click, more whirring -- Price is on automatic pilot. 
               Another soldier orders Alex up against a wall.

               Nobody sees Price taking pictures -- it happens too quickly.

               THROUGH CAMERA P.O.V. ALEX IS SHOT IN THE CHEST FROM POINT 
               BLANK RANGE -- FREEZE FRAMES click, click, whirring as the 
               images blur and the camera is dropped.

               PRICE STARES WITHOUT THE CAMERA

               P.O.V. ALEX LIES DEAD AS THE SOLDIERS LOOK AROUND The act 
               was random, almost nonchalant.

               PRICE STARTS TO RUN TOWARD ALEX shouting madly.

                                     PRICE
                         You fucks! You fucks!

               He stops quickly as they see him, realizing how exposed he 
               is.

               THE GUARDIA START FIRING AT HIM, realizing the murder was 
               recorded.

                                     GUARDIA SOLDIER
                         Fotografia!

               PRICE LEAPS IN HIS CAR and starts it up, racing around the 
               corner as bullets rip into the car.

               THE WINDOW SHATTERS, AND PRICE IS HIT IN THE SHOULDER He 
               clutches his bleeding arm as he races on.

               EXT. SHANTYTOWN BARRIO - DAY

               THE CAR GRINDS TO A HALT and Price leaps from it, racing 
               into a maze of ramshackle huts.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SOMOZA'S BUNKER

               A hastily called press conference. Tacho takes a quick drag 
               on a cigarette and makes the announcement.

                                     SOMOZA
                         It is with grave concern that we 
                         announce that Alexander Grazier, 
                         senior American correspondent, has 
                         been murdered at the hands of 
                         terrorists...

               A shock wave goes through the room -- hands raised, questions.

                                     SOMOZA
                         Mr. Kittle has prepared statements 
                         for you.

               Somoza turns and leaves as Kittle passes out press statements.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CLAIRE'S HOTEL ROOM

               TV is on. She's at the typewriter working on a story.

               A PHOTOGRAPH OF ALEX COMES ON THE TELEVISION NEWS, with 
               Spanish language commentary over the image.

               CLAIRE KEEPS WORKING AND GRADUALLY TYPES LESS AS SHE HEARS 
               the story, finally rising and moving in front of the 
               television as a local newsman reads of Alex's death and we 
               see the Somoza press announcement.

               The phone rings: Claire picks up the phone and listens 
               silently before hanging up. She sits down shakily on the bed 
               and starts crying.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE SHANTYTOWN BARRIO - DAY

               PRICE HURRIES THROUGH the passageways between tin shacks, 
               through tiny yards of goats and chickens, through houses as 
               poor that the war has nearly passed them by. Price is hurting, 
               and looks around with fear to see:

               THE GUARDIA SOLDIERS MOVE DOWN INTO THE SHANTYTOWN, fanning 
               out to quickly engulf the barrio. They move quickly.

               A HELICOPTER GUNSHIP MOVES IN LOW over the barrio and opens 
               up sporadic outbursts of fire to insure nobody will try to 
               flee.

               PRICE RUNS DOWN AN ALLEY and nearly runs right into the 
               Guardia. He hides behind a paper thin wall of flattened beer 
               cans -- the Guardia move past him only inches away. Price 
               starts off in another direction, but Guardia appear -- he is 
               trapped in the barrio.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOTEL LOBBY

               Journalists are everywhere -- suitcases packed -- trying to 
               get out of the country. The registration desk is chaos. Regis 
               tries to get the attention of the clerk -- so does everyone 
               else.

                                     REGIS
                         Get my bill and get me a cab, hey, 
                         amigo!

               The clerk is under attack.

                                     CLERK
                         No cabs.

                         No cabs!

               CLAIRE GETS OFF THE ELEVATOR AND MOVES THROUGH THIS CHAOS 
               Regis sees her and tries to give her comfort -- she's beyond 
               that. She wears a jacket and carries her bag -- she's going 
               somewhere.

                                     REGIS
                         I'm sorry, Claire...

               She pushes him away politely; she is single-minded now.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Heard from Russell?

                                     REGIS
                         Nobody has.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Wanta help me find him?

               Regis looks at her like she's crazy.

                                     REGIS
                         Claire... it's on the weird side out 
                         there...

               Hub Kittle enters the lobby, sees Claire and volunteers:

                                     HUB
                         Jesus Christ, Claire, a human tragedy, 
                         what can I say?

               Claire is nearly in tears, but resists.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Fuck off, Hub, get outta my way.

               CLAIRE EXITS THE HOTEL AND GETS INTO HER PRESS CAR

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREETS OF MANAGUA - LONG SHOT OF JAZY'S HOUSE - DAY

               Claire stays in her car and watches the house -- no way to 
               get close -- and she continues driving, her route dictated 
               by the same barricades that directed Alex and Price.

               She passes the dead pig in the street, and TWO RED CROSS 
               WORKERS make their way slowly around a corner, frightened. 
               Claire gets out of her car and approaches them.

                                     CLAIRE

                         Do you know where the American 
                         journalist was killed?

               They all point down a street. She shows them the polaroid of 
               Price and her.

                         Have you seen him?

               They haven't and continue on their way. Claire walks in the 
               direction they pointed -- no street fighting but many Guardia.

               P.O.V. PRICE'S CAR FAR DOWN THE STREET SURROUNDED BY GUARDIA

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SHANTYTOWN - DAY

               PRICE HUNCHES DOWN AND CRAWLS BEHIND THE STALLS as soldiers 
               move through the yards looking for him.

               A WOMAN IN A DOORWAY WATCHES PRICE HIDE

               THE WOMAN APPEARS IN A DOORWAY AND MOTIONS WITH HER HEAD for 
               Price to dart inside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE HOUSE - DAY

               Nothing is said. Price is led into a room, one of many -- 
               but this room is boarded over. There is no escape. Price is 
               in pain, his arm bleeds, he's tiring.

                                     WOMAN
                              (in Spanish)
                         This is the best I can offer.

                                     PRICE
                         Gracias.

               PRICE STANDS IN THE TINY ROOM WAITING

               He leans against the wall behind the door. He shuts his eyes -- 
               a noise at the door. When he opens them:

               THE WOMAN IS STANDING THERE WITH A GUN

               She hands it to him and leaves, bolting the door.

               PRICE LEANS AGAINST THE WALL HOLDING A REVOLVER and he waits -- 
               cameras around his neck, gun in hand, bloody, slightly 
               ridiculous, and scared.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE STREETS OF MANAGUA - DAY

               Price's shot up car is not far away, but she's afraid to 
               approach it. She shows the picture of Price to a small boy 
               who doesn't recognize it.

               GUARDIA SOLDIER SPOTS CLAIRE and walks toward her. She cannot 
               tell if the act is routine or threatening. He calls out to 
               her.

                                     SOLDIER
                         Venga aqui.

               She hesitates -- Alex is dead, everything is crazy. She starts 
               toward him, then changes her mind, turns, and walks quickly 
               away from him.

               THE SOLDIER RUNS TOWARD HER

               CLAIRE RUNS FASTER and darts into a narrow passageway behind 
               a house, where she looks back. He calls for support -- several 
               join him and hurry after her. Panicky, she runs between 
               houses.

               OVERHEAD PLANES BUZZ THE NEIGHBORHOOD as Claire emerges from 
               the 'maze' to see:

               P.O.V. PRICE'S CAR ABANDONED and full of holes near the shanty 
               town. Guardia are everywhere. The helicopter gunship is 
               overhead.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE HOUSE WHERE PRICE HIDES - DAY

               He hears the Guard breaking in, and he cocks his gun.

               INT. SAME HOUSE

               as the Squadron Leader and three soldiers burst in -- the 
               woman stands in the middle of the room and lies.

                                     WOMAN
                              (in Spanish)
                         Nobody is here. Get out.

               The Sqaudron Leader points to different rooms for each 
               soldier, and they proceed to kick in each door, automatic 
               rifles ready.

               PRICE'S ROOM AS HE HEARS A SOLDIER AT THIS DOOR.

               THE DOOR IS KICKED OPEN, AND A SOLDIER STEPS INTO THE ROOM 
               For a moment he doesn't see Price -- then he whirls and faces 
               the photographer who's so scared he's forgotten to raise his 
               gun.

               PRICE AND THE SOLDIER ARE FACE-TO-FACE The soldier is a 
               fourteen-year-old boy fighting back tears. He, too, is scared 
               to death. Neither is quite sure why he is there -- they just 
               want it to end.

               PRICE AND THE BOY AIM THEIR GUNS AT EACH OTHER as they hear 
               the voice of the Squadron Leader in the other room.

                                     LEADER
                         Esta alli?!
                              (Is he there?)

               No answer.

                                     LEADER
                         Esta alli?!

               SQUADRON LEADER HEADS TOWARD THE ROOM but as he does, the 
               boy soldier appears in the doorway.

                                     BOY SOLDIER
                         No esta aqui.

               The Leader grunts an order, and the squadron quickly heads 
               to the next house.

               PRICE'S BODY SLUMPS AGAINST THE WALL EXHAUSTED, and the woman 
               enters as soon as the last soldier has gone.

               Price's brief moment of peace is shattered by the screaming 
               of Guardia troops and the explosions of rocket fire from the 
               gunship. He looks outside.

               THE GUNSHIP FIRES INTO THE SHANTYTOWN killing several of its 
               own Guardia troops. A GUARDIA OFFICER screams at the gunship 
               and fires a hand gun at the giant chopper.

                                     GUARDIA OFFICER
                              (in Spanish)
                         We are you! We are you! What are you 
                         doing?!

               GUARDIA TROOPS EVACUATE THE SHANTYTOWN in a panicky scramble 
               to escape their own gunship.

               PRICE RACES THROUGH THE BACK OF THE SHANTYTOWN, taking 
               advantage of the chaos, and without slowing down, breaks 
               free of the maze of the barrio.

               CLAIRE'S P.O.V. OF PRICE RACING ACROSS THE STREET, past a 
               body and an overturned, smoking car, back into the rubble 
               strewn blocks of the edge of the city. A tanquetta comes 
               around a corner and sees Price a block away.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Russell!

               PRICE SEES HER, and races along a wall until they meet, 
               grabbing her on the run -- each is panicky and frightened -- 
               and they duck into very shallow cover, barely safe.

                                     PRICE
                         What're you doing here?!

               They embrace quickly and tightly, but look around nervously 
               as they do. Price isn't sure if anybody knows about Alex.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Alex!

                                     PRICE
                         The Guardia did it -- I got pictures.

               P.O.V. A TANQUETTA PASSES ON THE NEXT STREET, visible through 
               shattered holes in the buildings. A Guardia squadron passes.

               PRICE AND CLAIRE RUN DOWN THE STREET in the opposite 
               direction, their path guided somewhat by an overturned bus 
               in an intersection, abandoned barricades and roadblocks, and 
               the rubble of street fighting.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE STREET OF JAZY'S HOUSE - DAY

               PRICE AND CLAIRE hesitate at the corner and move slowly along, 
               seeing two Sandinistas, dressed half in camouflaged gear, 
               half disco. The TWO GUERRILLAS seem to control the street. 
               Price and Claire approach warily.

                                     PRICE
                         Hola.
                              (the Guerrillas nod; 
                              in Spanish)
                         Do you control this area?

               The Sandinista looks at his comrade, then looks around 
               nervously, frightened, then shrugs.

                                     DISCO SANDINISTA
                              (in Spanish)
                         I don't know.

               Price and Claire continue on down the street and 
               simultaneously noticed something strange:

               THE DOOR TO JAZY'S HOUSE IS WIDE OPEN They approach carefully 
               and look in a view to the court-yard. Claire sticks her head 
               in the door slowly, and as she does:

               A GIANT HAND GUN IS STUCK IN HER TEMPLE as TWO MUCHACHOS 
               quickly seize her and Price, dragging them inside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. JAZY'S COURTYARD - LATE IN DAY

               JAZY STANDS WITH A THIRD GUN AT HIS HEAD, being held by the 
               most forceful and crazed of three young Muchachos. With guns 
               on Jazy, Price, and Claire, there is much confusion as to 
               who's in charge and what exactly they're doing.

                                     MUCHACHO #1
                              (in Spanish)
                         Who are you?

                                     JAZY
                         They are my friends.

                                     MUCHACHO #2
                              (in Spanish)
                         Shut up. We kill them all.

                                     MUCHACHO #3
                              (in Spanish)
                         No. Only him.

               The guns are aimed back and forth in confusion -- Price and 
               Claire don't have a chance to respond, and they're not sure 
               what to say.

                                     MUCHACHO #1
                              (in Spanish)
                         Him or him or her?

               The Muchachos begin arguing rapidly among themselves; and as 
               they do, Jazy addresses Price and Claire coolly.

                                     JAZY
                         Well, here we are, eh?

                                     MUCHACHO #1
                              (in Spanish)
                         Assassin! Shut up!

                                     JAZY
                         The boys are confused -- they think 
                         I had their family killed.

                                     PRICE
                         You murder people.

                                     JAZY
                         "Murder" is a word for criminals. I 
                         have a job to protect the stability 
                         of a continent.

                                     MUCHACHO #3
                         Pig! Hijo de puta!

                                     JAZY
                         Please...

               He is not begging for his life as much as for them to calm 
               down.

                                     CLAIRE
                         You got caught by some boys?

                                     JAZY
                         Yes. Poets too, I imagine.
                              (beat)
                         Is your recorder on?

                                     CLAIRE
                              (hesitates)
                         Yes.

                                     JAZY
                         Good. I have a speech to make.

               The Muchachos don't understand what he's saying, but they 
               stop to listen to his style. The guns remained trained on 
               all three.

                                     JAZY
                         I like you people, but you are 
                         sentimental shits. You fall in love 
                         with the poets, the poets fall in 
                         love with the Marxists, the Marxists 
                         fall in love with themselves. The 
                         country is destroyed with rhetoric, 
                         and in the end we are stuck with 
                         tyrants.

                                     MUCHACHO #1
                              (in Spanish)
                         Shut up!

               Jazy turns to the boy who jams the gun into his head and 
               speaks with tired authority.

                                     JAZY
                         Un minuto, por favor.

                                     MUCHACHO #2
                              (to Price and Claire, 
                              more calmly)
                         Who are you?

                                     JAZY
                              (in Spanish)
                         They are journalists.

               The Muchachos are immediately surprised and delighted, and 
               one of them speaks in excited, broken English.

                                     MUCHACHO #1
                         Periodistas! Take this picture! I'm 
                         going to blow his head off.

               The Muchachos quickly withdraw their guns from Price and 
               Claire and aim them all at Jazy's head.

                                     JAZY
                         Somoza? He is a tyrant too, of course. 
                         A butcher.
                              (beat)
                         But finally that is not the point, 
                         you see. If we wish to survive -- we 
                         have a choice of tyrants, and for 
                         all the right reasons, your poets

                         brilliant... but I am alive, and

                         You picked the wrong side.

                                     JAZY

                         the bullet enters the skull or as it 
                         comes out? This wall's a nice color, 
                         eh? I can move into the sunlight.

               CLAIRE TURNS AND WALKS AWAY, her back to the scene.

                                     JAZY
                              (to Claire)
                         It's just a story!

               PRICE REMAINS AND STARES AT JAZY as the Muchachos grow 
               increasingly impatient. Some part of him wants to take the 
               picture.

                                     MUCHACHO #1
                              (in Spanish)
                         Shut up!

                                     JAZY
                         They say that if somebody's holding 
                         a gun on you, you should never stop 
                         talking... that's the theory -- who 
                         knows?...

               PRICE TURNS AND WALKS AWAY toward Claire. Still -- Jazy talks.

                                     JAZY
                         Maybe it's a good thing that I talk 
                         too much...

               A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT.

               Price grimaces. Claire shuts her eyes. They turn to look at 
               the fallen Jazy as the Three Muchachos, frightened by their 
               own act, race back into the street. For several moments Price 
               and Claire stand, frozen, until the rumbling sound of a 
               helicopter gunship nearby forces them to hurry outside.

               PRICE AND CLAIRE GO TO THE DOORWAY and look out as a jeep 
               full of Guardia screams past

               P.O.V. SEVERAL GUERRILLAS RETREATING FROM AN ADVANCING 
               TANQUETTA a block away. The neighborhood seems to be changing 
               hands again.

               Price and Claire slump in the darkness near the doorway; she 
               touches near his wounded arm.

                                     CLAIRE
                         You okay?
                              (he nods)
                         Russell... what did Alex do?

                                     PRICE
                         Nothing. He asked for directions.

               She shakes her head and leans it against Price's shoulder 
               but the distant popping of guns does not even allow her a 
               moment of mourning. Their heads pop up nervously.

                                     PRICE
                         We gotta get outta sight -- half the 
                         fucking army's looking for me...

                                     CLAIRE
                         They're not looking for me.

               Silence.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Let me have the film...
                              (beat; unsure)
                         ...if I can't get to the hotel I'll 
                         come back here...

               Price doesn't want her to go alone, but he's not that excited 
               about hiding out in the middle of the city either.

                                     PRICE
                         Aw, Christ...
                              (frustrated)
                         I've wrecked everything else, at 
                         least let me take care of you here.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Russell... it's more dangerous being 
                         with you than being alone.

               He knows she's right. He loves her, and he's made enough 
               disastrous decisions lately. He hesitates, then pops open 
               his camera and removes the film. Price ties the film into 
               the white flag that hangs from a stick stuck into her belt.

               PRICE AND CLAIRE EMBRACE AND KISS BRIEFLY

                                     PRICE
                         Don't get hurt.

                                     CLAIRE
                              (affectionately)
                         That's great advice.

               They kiss, and Claire runs out after a Red Cross truck. Price 
               watches nervously until they turn a corner, out of sight, 
               then goes back inside Jazy's courtyard. PRICE NEARLY STUMBLES 
               OVER JAZY'S BODY, stops, stares -- he'd forgotten already. 
               The body makes him uneasy, and after several moments he finds 
               a sheet and covers Jazy. Price then sits down and waits 
               nervously, sharing the courtyard with Jazy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREETS OF MANAGUA - DUSK

               CLAIRE WALKS ALONGSIDE THE RED CROSS TRUCK as it comes around 
               a corner. The truck turns one direction, she wants to go the 
               other way toward the hotel.

               P.O.V. -- THE INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL ON THE HILL IN DISTANCE - 
               DUSK

               Guardia troops heavily patrol the ground between Claire and 
               the hotel -- a jeep, a troop carrier, a tanquetta, and fifty 
               foot soldiers.

               CLAIRE TAKES TEMPORARY COVER offered by a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN 
               who sees that she is afraid of La Guardia. Claire steps behind 
               a walled yard. Moments later:

               A BOY ON A BIKE RIDES SLOWLY OUT OF THE YARD and turns up 
               the hill toward the Guardia and the hotel. Claire's white 
               flag is tied to his handlebars.

               CLAIRE WATCHES FEARFULLY as the boy pedals into the military 
               zone. The woman offers Claire some food; she declines.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE ROAD TO THE INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL - DUSK

               THE BOY PEDALS slowly, in no hurry, past La Guardia troops. 
               Some of them watch him curiously, some ignore him. The white 
               flag flutters as he rides.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREETS OF MANAGUA - DUSK

               CLAIRE RETRACES HER STEPS to the block where Price is hiding 
               in Jazy's house.

               THE TWO DISCO SANDINISTAS LIE DEAD IN THE STREET, a dog sniffs 
               at the bodies. Claire looks around -- there is little sign 
               of life. She enters Jazy's house.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. JAZY'S HOUSE - DUSK

               CLAIRE ENTERS and stops. She calls out his name, no answer. 
               Price is gone. She hurries back outside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. JAZY'S HOUSE - DUSK

               TWO GUARDIA TROOP CARRIERS RACE PAST, sirens screaming, loaded 
               with Guardia soldiers. Claire steps into the street unsurely, 
               looking every direction.

               PEOPLE BEGIN COMING OUT OF THEIR HOMES and what remains of 
               their small homes. They come one at a time at first, then in 
               small groups, carrying belongings, pets, chickens, etc.

               CLAIRE SHOWS A PICTURE OF PRICE AND HER to a woman who comes 
               out of the house next to Jazy's, but the woman shakes her 
               head, not recognizing Price.

               A PUSH-PULL PLANE DIVES IN LOW FIRING ROCKETS at the homes.

               THE CROWD GROWS and chaotically flees the destruction, 
               gradually finding a direction out of the city. Claire is 
               swept along in the crowds, at first without choice, then 
               finally fleeing for her life with the rest of Managua. As 
               she moves with the crowd, she looks for Price everywhere, 
               without success.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. A TEMPORARY REFUGEE CAMP - NIGHT

               SEVERAL CAMPFIRES burn near the edge of the city where dozens 
               have taken temporary refuge. Claire arrives to see: A BODY 
               ON A STRETCHER BEING CARRIED up outside stairs to a rooftop 
               from which glow several bare bulbs. She goes up the stairs 
               to the rooftop.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. A ROOFTOP HOSPITAL - NIGHT

               A MAKESHIFT MOBILE HOSPITAL under awnings and palm fronds, 
               capable of moving location in minutes. A WOMAN DOCTOR and 
               two temporary orderlies tend to wounded. A small black and 
               white television sits on a table and those who are able watch 
               the seige of Managua on television while it goes on around 
               them. Claire looks for Price among the dead or wounded.

               P.O.V. -- THE CITY UNDER ATTACK

               Claire watches for several moments -- smoke, flame, the 
               buzzing sound of planes swooping low, fleeing crowds. She 
               then notices the television.

               PRICE'S FOOTAGE OF ALEX'S DEATH comes on the TV screen, and 
               she pushes closer to see the grim sequence. The NEWS 
               COMMENTATOR explains in Spanish what we see CLAIRE IS SO 
               DISTURBED AT THE IMAGES that she turns away, sickened, hurt, 
               guilty, outraged, but unable to break down. She closes her 
               eyes -- her face is covered with tears. The Doctor notices 
               this and speaks softly to her.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Journalist?
                              (Claire nods)
                         You knew the man who was killed?
                              (she nods again)
                         Fifty thousand Nicaraguans have 
                         died... and now one Yankee.
                              (beat)
                         Perhaps now Americans will be outraged 
                         at what is happening here, eh?

               It takes a while for Claire to respond.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Yes... perhaps they will.

               Noise in the distance from mortars. The Doctor speaks calmly, 
               without bitterness in the voice, but with total conviction.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Maybe we should have killed an 
                         American journalist fifty years ago.

               Claire acknowledges the grim truth of the observation with a 
               slight nod, and walks to the railing as:

               ALEX'S DEATH IS REPEATED IN FREEZE FRAME SEQUENCE over and 
               over again as the Orderlies, Doctor, and patients gather to 
               watch with fascination.

               CLAIRE STARES OUT AT THE CITY ON FIRE, when her eye catches 
               something -- a light in the sky. She watches:

               P.O.V. -- A HELICOPTER WITH SEARCHLIGHT PASSES OVERHEAD, 
               momentarily illuminating the hospital, but it continues on, 
               curiously uninterested in the Guerrilla activity. The chopper 
               sweeps above a nearby hill and hovers, then slowly lowers to 
               earth.

               CLAIRE WATCHES with interest then descends the stairs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE CEMETERY - NIGHT

               SOMOZA WATCHES AS A BACK HOE DIGS UP THE COFFINS of his 
               parents. An Army helicopter lands, lighting the scene, and 
               Miss Panama rushes from the chopper into his arms as the 
               turbulence from the blades raises her dress and musses his 
               hair. Soldiers place the dirt-covered caskets on the roofs 
               of Somoza's two Mercedes, hastily tie them down, and the 
               strange motorcade, flanked by two heavily armed jeeps, drives 
               off into the dark.

               CLAIRE WATCHES IT ALL from a safe distance, not far from the 
               refugee camp. She turns and walks slowly back to the camp.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE REFUGEE CAMP - LATE AT NIGHT

               Claire sits down against the remains of a wall. The war has 
               overtaken her -- she doesn't know if Price is alive -- and 
               though totally involved, she is at last an observer once 
               again. Claire notices the tiny red light of her recorder is 
               still on. She turns it off, and as the sounds of battle 
               gradually die down, Claire falls asleep -- exhausted.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. THE REFUGEE CAMP - DAWN

               CLAIRE SLEEPS AGAINST THE WALL as a dog sniffs and licks her 
               face. She awakens with a start -- the dog scurries away. 
               Claire rises and looks around.

               A LOCAL WOMAN PUSHES A CART carrying the wrapped body of her 
               husband through the otherwise quiet streets of Managua.

               CLAIRE MOVES THROUGH THE CAMP just coming to life, and looks 
               around trying to interpret the eerie silence. A WOMAN tends 
               to her TWO SMALL CHILDREN.

                                     CLAIRE
                              (in Spanish)
                         Have you seen La Guardia?

                                     WOMAN WITH CHILDREN
                              (in Spanish)
                         No. Is the war over?

                                     CLAIRE
                              (in Spanish)
                         I don't know.

               A DISTANT, DRONING NOISE GETS STEADILY LOUDER. Claire looks 
               around nervously.

               A CHILD RUNS DOWN THE STREET SHOUTING

                                     CHILD
                         Tanquettas! Tanquettas!

               P.O.V. -- SEVERAL TANQUETTAS AND EARTH MOVERS coming over 
               the hill in the distance. The Refugees look up fearfully and 
               some hide. As the war machinery gets closer, we see that:

               SANDINISTAS ARE DRIVING THE MACHINES draped with red and 
               black (F.S.L.N.), blue and white (Nicaraguan), and yellow 
               and white (the Vatican) flags. Graffiti of victory covers 
               the tanquettas.

               PEOPLE COME INTO THE STREET CHEERING, embracing, only 
               gradually realizing what has happened.

                                     WOMAN WITH CHILDREN
                              (in Spanish)
                         Is the war over?

                                     CLAIRE
                         Yes.

                                     WOMAN WITH CHILDREN
                         Es bueno.
                              (It is good.)

               The woman continues with her children, her comment 
               unemotional, and Claire smiles slightly and walks away, 
               through a city awakening slowly to its victory.

               CLAIRE STOPS A RED CROSS TRUCK and shows the driver her 
               picture of Price. The picture means nothing to the driver. 
               Claire continues through the city, looking for Price.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL - MORNING

               CLAIRE WALKS INTO THE POOL AREA where chairs and tables float 
               in the pool, the bar is overturned, and the once sumptuous 
               press oasis is a disaster.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL - MORNING

               CLAIRE ENTERS A DESERTED LOBBY, also a mess, and hesitates 
               before climbing the circular stairs.

               CLAIRE LOOKS INTO PRICE'S ROOM, and finds it empty, and 
               typically messy.

               CLAIRE WALKS INTO HER OWN ROOM -- PRICE STANDS AT THE BALCONY 
               looking out at the jubilant city from which smoke still rises.

               CLAIRE AND PRICE EMBRACE DEEPLY, holding onto each other 
               without the slightest intention of letting go.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. THE INTERCONTINENTAL LOBBY - LATER - DAY

               PRICE AND CLAIRE COME DOWNSTAIRS to the lobby. They are 
               cleaned up in fresh clothes; they have survived and the war 
               is over.

               THE LOBBY IS COMING TO LIFE AGAIN with Regis' camera crew, 
               who look like they've had a long night, a BUS BOY, A MAID, 
               AN OLD COUPLE, and A WHITE WOMAN, 38, with TWO SMALL DAUGHTERS -- 
               all either sit or mill in the b.g.

               PRICE AND CLAIRE STOP SHORT at what they see.

                                     PRICE
                         Alex.

               P.O.V. -- A HANDMADE CASKET SITTING IN THE LOBBY with the 
               name, "A. Grazier" scrawled in felt pen.

               Price and Claire stand next to the box silently -- there is 
               nothing to say -- but the silence is interrupted by a familiar 
               voice that is polite, unforced, and sincere.

                                     VOICE OF HUB KITTLE
                         It was the best I would do under the 
                         circumstances. The casket, I mean.

               Awkward silence until they realize that he's sincere.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Can you help us ship it home?

                                     HUB
                         I've already taken care of it.
                              (beat)
                         I always liked the guy. I can't even 
                         get tickets for my own family, but I 
                         could get you two on the plane if 
                         you want.

               We see the woman and little girls as Hub's family.

                                     PRICE
                         Yes, please...

                                     HUB
                         Tacho's in Miami.

               A shared silence at the lunacy of the moment, interrupted by 
               the tired voice of one of Hub's daughters.

                                     HUB'S DAUGHTER
                         Daddy!

                                     HUB
                              (to Price and Claire)
                         I am sorry. I had a job to do -- 
                         that's all -- it put me in some 
                         unhappy situations.

               Hub goes over to take care of his family.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PLAZA OF MANAGUA'S LARGEST CATHEDRAL - LATER - DAY

               Thousands of people have gathered to celebrate in loud and 
               joyous singing, led by a group on the highest cathedral steps, 
               surrounded by Revolutionary leaders waving to the crowds. A 
               SINGING GROUP sings a song to Nicaragua, and a song to Rafael.

               RAFAEL'S BODY IN A FANCY CASKET is carried in through the 
               crowd to wild cheering and singing. High over the pallbearers' 
               heads it moves through the crowds.

               PRICE AND CLAIRE STAND TO THE SIDE watching it all. The 
               celebration is joyously infectious, and for the moment we 
               can forget the bloodshed, forget the problems that lay ahead, 
               forget even the death of Alex.

               PRICE PULLS OUT A CAMERA and begins taking pictures of the 
               celebration.

               ISELA IS AT THE MICROPHONE with other Guerrilla leaders.

               CLAIRE WORKS THROUGH THE CROWD with her mike held high, 
               recording the singing of the crowd.

               PRICE BACKS UNDER THE AWNING of a stand selling refreshments, 
               and especially Rum and Coke mixtures known suddenly and 
               triumphantly as "Nicalibres." As Price snaps off pictures -- 
               a voice from an American in casual street clothes drinking 
               at the temporary bar.

                                     OATES
                         Hey, Pricey...

               Price looks over to see the smiling Oates.

                                     OATES
                         It's all over, eh? We made it. I 
                         like the singing.

                                     PRICE
                         What're you doing here?

                                     OATES
                         Free country. Now it's free, anyway.
                              (raises his drink)
                         Nicalibre!

               Oates holds up his Kodak Instamatic camera.

                                     OATES
                         How 'bout a quickie?
                              (no response)
                         No? Things are heating up in 
                         Thailand... thought I'd check it 
                         out.
                              (beat)
                         You ain't gonna turn me in, are ya?

               PRICE TURNS AND WALKS AWAY

                                     OATES
                         Am I gonna see ya in Thailand? We 
                         could be friends!

               Price keeps walking, into the crowd, where he finds Claire. 
               Oates orders another Nicalibre, and beats his foot to the 
               music.

               PRICE AND CLAIRE IN THE CROWD

                                     PRICE
                         We've got a plane to catch.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Did you get enough pictures?

               No answer -- a final complicated question from Claire -- 
               they smile. Price waves for a cab which pulls over. They get 
               in the cab and drive away.

               HOLD ON THE VICTORY CELEBRATION

                                         THE END

                         FADE IN:

          INT. PASSENGER JET - EARLY MORNING

          Sleepy thick fatigue, the end of a red-eye flight. Most
          passengers still asleep, a few read, or stare blankly.
          In business class, A HUSBAND and WIFE, mid-30's. He's awake,
          reading a document. She sleeps nestled against his shoulder.
          He's trim, sharp, good looking in an academic way. Even in
          sleep, she's beautiful. Wide-mouthed and honey-haired.
          The plane's aspect SHIFTS, the pilot's voice comes on in
          German. The man lifts his window shade, peers out at the
          first rays of sun touching the skyline of Berlin.

          EXT. TEGEL AIRPORT, BERLIN - EARLY MORNING

          Halo of lights. Giant talons, the airplane's LANDING GEAR
          appears through cloud. Tires hit slick asphalt.

          INT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL, TEGEL AIRPORT - SAME

          The couple. Dr. Martin Harris and Elizabeth Harris. WIDER: a
          German IMMIGRATION OFFICER glances up at MARTIN and LIZ. KA-
          CHUNK! KA-CHUNK! Stamps both passports, swipes the bar
          codes over a scanner, hands them back. Martin slips his into
          a leather briefcase.

          EXT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL, TEGEL AIRPORT - DAWN

          Raining. A melee of travelers and vehicles. Liz beside him,
          Martin wheels a baggage cart through the crush. An ATTENDANT
          ushers them toward a waiting cab and DRIVER...
          a CRASH of THUNDER -- the rain suddenly triples in
          strength. A DELUGE. The taxi driver hustles Martin and Liz
          towards his car. He shields his head with a newspaper,
          piling their bags into the trunk, cursing.
          Martin sets down his case, moves to help the driver...

          I/E. TAXI CAB - DAWN
          The DRIVER merges onto the autobahn. Liz yawns with jet-lag,
          studies Martin who stares out at the passing city.

                         LIZ
          Hey... You're gonna do great.
          You always do.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

          I/E. TAXI/HOTEL IMPERIAL, BERLIN - MORNING
          Modern 'Deco Revival' hotel/conference center. A banner
          welcomes delegates to the World Biotechnology Forum. The
          Harris' taxi pulls up in the forecourt thick with red-eye
          travelers arriving for early morning check-in.
          Martin takes out his billfold.

                         MARTIN
          I'll do this. You check in.
          Liz pecks his cheek, gets out. Martin leans forward.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          How much do we owe you?

          INT. HOTEL LOBBY - SAME

          Liz presses up to the crowded desk. A busy RECEPTIONIST
          takes Liz's booking slip.

                         LIZ
          The Eisenhower suite. Dr. and
          Mrs. Harris.

          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT - SAME

          A BELLHOP holds a large umbrella up to the rain, loads the
          Harris' bags onto his cart. Shuts the trunk, the taxi pulls
          away. Heading for the entrance...

                         BELLHOP
          Welcome to the Hotel Imperial.
          Have you stayed with us before?

                         MARTIN
          No, this is our first visit to
          Berlin. We're --
          -- he stops short, staring at their bags, stacked on the
          luggage cart. He turns, tracks the their taxi, already
          pulling out of the drive...

          INT. HOTEL LOBBY - SAME

          a stab of concern on Liz's face.

                         LIZ
          What do you mean the suite may
          not be available?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         CONTINUED:

                         RECEPTIONIST
          I have to check with the manager.
          Security inspections of the rooms
          are still being completed.

                         LIZ
          But we confirmed two months ago.
          Receptionist raises an apologetic hand as she attends to a
          ringing phone. Liz sighs, glances back toward the entrance.
          Suddenly curious as she sees...

          LIZ'S P.O.V. -- THROUGH THE GLASS WALL
          . Martin standing in the open door of the next taxi in
          line. He speaks to the bellhop who nods, quickly pushing the
          cart in through the doors, headed for Liz...

          I/E. TAXI/BERLIN - SAME
          Martin getting in, agitated.

                         MARTIN
          Tegel airport. Arrivals. Quick.
          The driver pulls out into traffic. The rain still heavy.
          Martin stares out at the wet city. Eyes track as the shadowy
          columns of the Brandenburg Gate pass by. He lets himself
          relax a little, enjoying this moment of forced calm.
          He catches sight of the driver in the rear-view. Young,
          female, shortish hair. Tomboy cute. Smart eyes, older than
          her years. Layers of clothing. GINA.
          She glances into the mirror, catches Martin watching her.

                         GINA
          Everyone says how much it's
          changed. Berlin.
          Eyes connect, brief. Wipers flip-flap.

                         MARTIN
          .I wouldn't know. First time.

                         GINA
          Yes, me too. I mean, I wouldn't
          know either. You're American?
          He looks back at her, inquisitive...

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          For the airport, it's always

          Martin nods, pulls out his phone. Service dies as Gina
          downshifts, Doc Martins working the pedals, accelerates away
          from the large "Flughafen" (Airport) sign, down a cobbled
          road next to main route.

                         MARTIN
          I think you missed...
          He stops, smiles as he realizes she's navigated around a
          large construction back-up, saving them time.

                         GINA
          You do what you do, I do what I
          do, right?

                         MARTIN
          What do you do, when you're
          not...?
          She laughs. He smiles, nods. Okay, dumb thing to say.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Sorry, I didn't mean anything --

                         GINA
          It's okay. I know what you
          meant.
          Her eyes meet his in the mirror.
          She swings the taxi onto Wilhelmstrasse. Stops at a red
          light. Ahead, the Marshall Bridge over the River Spree.

          LIGHT TURNS GREEN
          Gina moves the taxi mid-stream in the traffic heading onto
          the bridge. Martin checks his phone, he's got service. He
          starts to dial...
          Suddenly -- the cars in front of her start VEERING WILDLY IN
          DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS, just missing the boxed REFRIGERATOR
          tumbling off the truck in front of them. The box BURSTS
          open. Gina swerves to avoid it, CLIPS the corner...
          front tire BLOWS OUT... taxi skids crazily, HITS the
          CURB. Tires SHREDDING... shower of SPARKS. Taxi SLAMS over
          the curb, THROUGH the rail. Plunges off the bridge.

                         MARTIN'S FACE
          Strangely serene. Intense vivid IMAGES... the playing card
          'ACE TAXIS' logo on the dash... GINA'S EYES in the MIRROR...
          Silent free-fall dive. Timeless. Dreamlike.

          WHAM--! TAXI HITS THE WATER
          Martin's head SMACKS against the side window. Gina cushioned
          by the airbags, which she wrestles back. WATER SPRAYS IN.
          Gina can't open her door. Steel steering-lock on the floor.
          Grabs it, SMASHES the side window. Hauls herself out...

          INTO THE RIVER
          . gasping. On the bridge above, people frantically flag
          down traffic... Gina turns, sees the Taxi, midstream,
          sinking. Martin still in back, unconscious.
          No time. Gina gulps air, dives. She reaches into the front
          of the cab, grabs the steering lock, HAMMERS it against the
          passenger window, glances up:
          THE SURFACE, starts to recede as the taxi slips underneath,
          sinking...
          Gina hammers at the glass again, it BREAKS. Grabs Martin's
          limp body, drags him up to the surface.
          A CROWD ON the bank. People wading out to help. Taking
          Martin from her, carrying him up onto dry land. LIGHTS,
          SIRENS... The POLICE arriving, pushing back the crowd.
          PARAMEDICS quickly laying Martin out on the concrete.
          Everyone's focus on the unconscious man. Gina eases back...
          melts away into the growing horde of on-lookers as the
          paramedics rip open Martin's shirt...
          feeding a tube down his throat. Pushing on his stomach.
          DEFIBRILLATOR paddles. WHINE as defibrillators charge.
          A PARAMEDIC lifts Martin's eyelid, shines a flashlight...

          UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL. Youthful MARTIN speaking on the
          spotlit podium. Intense, energized. A college age LIZ in
          the audience. LAUGHTER of rapt students. Loud APPLAUSE. A
          jovial older COLLEAGUE eagerly shaking Martin's hand...

          SMASH BACK TO THE RIVER BANK...
          Paddles on Martin's chest. Paramedic calls out:

                         PARAMEDIC

          blossom. Butterflies' wings SHIMMER in sunlight...

          WHOMPF! SECOND ARCING CHARGE...
          Martin's chest heaves up. Slumps back down...

          SMASH CUT INTO MEMORY -- TWO BODIES MOVING...
          . Liz and Martin making love. Passionate, intertwined.

          WHOMPF! ANOTHER SURGE OF ELECTRICITY...
          Martin's chest rising up...

          SMASH CUT AGAIN -- LIZ...
          . half-dressed, hair ruffled and wet. Towelling it.
          Turning toward us. Smiles. Her lips moving...

          WHOMPF! A FOURTH PULSE...
          Martin's body slumping back. Sudden QUIET now, the world
          removed. Just his face. His eyes.

          MARTIN (V.O.)
          They say your whole life flashes
          before you... but it's the little
          things... the details... the
          moments. Its like looking at a
          painting. Stand close, all you
          can see are the brush strokes.
          It's only when you step back that
          you get the whole picture...

          private moment, speaking in German on her cell-phone. The
          Nurse looks over, straight at us, realization in her face,
          she hurries from the room.
          We REVOLVE... finding... MARTIN HARRIS. Arms by his sides.
          A few days beard. A sutured cut on his temple. His eyes
          fluttering, barely open... then closing.
          Clipboard beside the bed. An admission form. In German.
          Where Martin's name should be: "unbekannte maennliche
          Person", and the SUBTITLE becomes our MAIN TITLE...

          'UNKNOWN WHITE MALE'...

          CLOSE - MARTIN'S FACE
          Squeak of a door. Distant FOOTSTEPS. Quiet again. Just the
          distant PULSE of his heartbeat. His eyes... flick OPEN.

          MARTIN'S P.O.V. - HIS SURROUNDINGS...
          Vision BLURRED, BLINKING to focus. Scrubbed floor, white
          walls, Banks of drips and monitors, his possessions on a
          table near him...

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Konnen Sie mich horen?

          MARTIN'S EYES -- TRACKING OVER
          Daylight through a window. Sitting by the bed is a dark-
          haired man with a van Dyke beard. DR. FARGE.

                         FARGE
          Wenn Sie mich horen konnen,
          blinken Sie zweimal.
          He watches as Martin's eyes tilt. Look directly at him. A
          sound. A dry croak... slowly forms itself into speech:

                         MARTIN
          I... I don't... speak German...

                         FARGE

          My name is Doctor Farge. You are
          in the Waldfriede Hospital. I'm
          the head neurologist here. You
          have been in an accident.

                         (BEAT)
          Can you tell me your name?
          Beat. Martin nods. Voice weak.

                         MARTIN
          Martin... Harris. Doctor...
          Martin Harris...
          Farge exchanges a look with the nurse. To Martin...

                         FARCE
          Where are you staying? Is there
          anyone here, in Berlin, that we

                         MIGHT --
          Martin suddenly looks around, struggles to sit up.

                         MARTIN
          My wife.. ?

                         (SUDDEN PANIC)
          Where's my wife? Liz...? Is she
          hurt? Where is she --?!

                         FARGE
          Doctor Harris, it's all right.
          The taxi you were in went into
          the river. You were the only
          passenger. Your heart stopped
          for six minutes. It is Thursday,
          November 27th. For four days you
          have been in a coma.

                         MARTIN
          Thanksgiving... but my wife...
          she's in Berlin with me. Where
          is she? Why isn't she here?

                         FARGE
          We didn't find any identification
          with you, Doctor Harris... the
          driver, who saved your life,
          disappeared soon after the
          accident and no one else has come
          forward. I must apologize, but
          we had no idea who you were.
          It sinks in. Martin shakes his head wretchedly.

                         MARTIN
          Oh, Jesus... Liz doesn't know...
          She'll... she'll be worried sick.

          Where can we reach your wife?
          Does she have a cell phone?

                         MARTIN
          Yes... yes, she does... it's... I
          can't remember...
          His voice trails off. A long beat. Farge asks gently:

                         FARGE
          Can you tell me what you do
          remember, Martin? Do you
          remember what day it is?
          A beat. Giving it thought... then:

                         MARTIN
          Thanksgiving. You told me that.
          I remember... almost everything.
          But I don't know how I got here.
          Another beat. He shakes his head. Scared...

                         FARGE
          It's called retrograde amnesia.
          With severe trauma of this kind,
          memories get lost, or fractured.
          Most return... although it's
          unlikely you'll ever fully recall
          the events around your accident.

                         (BEAT)
          In the meantime, let us see if
          anyone has filed a report looking
          for a Martin Harris, okay?

                         MARTIN
          Yes, yes... okay.

          Beat. The nurse shakes her head, apologetic.

          small blue BOOK. Crinkled, water-stained.
          Painful effort, he rises, reaches out and picks up the watch.
          It's 6.48. He turns the watch over. An engraving on the
           backplate: "E.H. to M.H. 7.18.03".

          FLASH OF MEMORY...
          Snow falling outside a warmly lit living room. A fire
          crackles. Martin unwraps a present: The Watch. He turns it

          beautiful, also smiling...

          .She gave it to me, our
          anniversary.
          The Nurse smiles, shakes her head, not understanding.
          Martin sets the watch down, picks up the little blue book
          beside the watch -- 'Horticus' -- the classic botanical
          reference. He flicks through it, reads the handwritten
          inscription: "For Martin, that he may discover the worlds
          inside..." A distant smile...

          BACK IN THE HOSPITAL ROOM
          Martin starts to close the book, tracks some NUMBERS,
          handwritten on the endpaper. A beat.
          He shuts the book, glances at the TV, silently playing the
          local English language TV News: "Prince Fahad arrives in
          Berlin..." Biotech Forum logo. A striking 30-something
          Saudi man shakes hands with German dignitaries. A shot of

          Martin fully dressed. Farge has just hung up the phone,
          trying to reason with him.

                         FARGE
          -- you have to realize the risk --

                         MARTIN
          Doctor, I've been gone for four
          days. My wife is out there, in a
          city she doesn't know. She must
          be terrified... I need to find
          her before --

                         FARGE
          -- Let me call the hotel again.
          We can leave a message...

                         MARTIN
          Yes, fine, but look, I know her.
          She's looking for me. You're
          married, aren't you? What would
          you do?
          Farge tracks his own wedding band. A long beat. He sighs.
          Not happy about this at all.

                         FARGE
          This is my card. Any nausea,
          dizziness, difficulty with
          speech, you contact me
          immediately. Do you understand?

          Martin gets out, strong Deja Vu. Trying to orient.

          Eyes peeled for a possible glimpse of Liz, Martin heads for
          elevators. HOTEL SECURITY is everywhere. An entrance to a
          ballroom is flanked by guards, checking IDs and invitations.

          INT. 14TH FLOOR, HOTEL IMPERIAL - NIGHT

          DING. Martin steps out into carpeted silence, makes his way
          down the hall to the 'Eisenhower Suite.' About to knock when
          he sees the door is ajar. A beat. Martin pushes it open...

                         MARTIN
          .Liz?

          INT. EISENHOWER SUITE - CONTINUOUS

          . hallway leads into the spacious sitting room. No one
          there. Draped over a chair, Martin recognizes Liz's jacket.
          Martin smiles, blinks against tears, he's home.
          Sound of MOVEMENT from the BEDROOM DOOR...

                         MARTIN
          Liz! I'm here, I...
          A HOTEL MAID appears from the bedroom door. Startled as she
          sees Martin...

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          My wife... Meine Frau... I'm
          looking for Mrs. Harris...
          She suddenly gets him... nodding, pointing down.

                         MAID
          Ah. Entpfang... reception...

          INT. HOTEL IMPERIAL, MEZZANINE LEVEL - NIGHT

          World MUSIC. GUESTS flow in through the ornate doors. Martin
          moves among them. Significantly under-dressed in his
          tattered jacket, the sutured head injury. Almost at the
          doors... when a hotel SECURITY GUARD intercepts him.

                         GUARD
          Excuse me, sir. Do you have an
          invitation, sir?

                         MARTIN
          No... I mean yes...
          Distracted, still looking at passing faces...

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          I don't have it with me. My
          name's Harris, Dr. Martin Harris.
          I'm on the list. My wife is
          Elizabeth Harris.

          I'm trying to find her. I've
          been in the hospital.
          As the guard checks a screen, a crop-haired man in a cheap
          suit nearby tracks them: HERR STRAUSS, head of hotel
          security. He approaches, also checks the screen as the guard
          speaks to him quietly in German.

                         STRAUSS
          Dr. Harris. Do you have any
          other identification? Passport?
          Drivers license?

                         MARTIN
          I've already told this gentleman,
          I've been in the hospital. I was
          in an accident...
          Martin sees someone through the crowd...

          P.O.V. -- ENTERING FROM THE FAR DOOR
          a striking, intense-looking man with dark, wiry hair, a
          designer laptop bag slung over his shoulder. Smiling, arms
          around his two ten year old daughters, twin GIRLS, prettily
          dressed. Immediately the center of attention. People moving
          forward to meet him. Flashguns POP...
          MARTIN, raises his hand, calling out:

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Professor Bressler!
          Words lost in the noise. Martin pushes toward him. But:

                         STRAUSS
          I'm sorry, sir...

                         MARTIN
          That's Professor Bressler, right
          there. He knows me, he can
          confirm who I am.

                         STRAUSS
          If you would be patient, sir.

                         MARTIN
          No, I'm done being patient...
          Martin stops short. Staring past them:

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          That's her, that's my wife. Over
          there. By the buffet table.

          P.O.V -- GLIMPSED THROUGH THE CROWD
          Liz. Looking superb in a black evening dress. In
          conversation with a group of men and women.

                         MARTIN
          Seeing her. The look on his face. Processing... an
          overwhelming mixture of confusion and relief.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          That's her. That's Liz, my wife.
          Strauss stares at him blankly. Martin starts to lose it.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Look I have been missing for four
          days and she has no idea what
          happened to me! So you need to
          take me to her, right now.
          Heads are turning. A beat. Herr Strauss mutters to the
          guard, then beckons Martin to accompany him inside.

          MARTIN AND STRAUSS
          thread through the crush. Martin ignoring the glances he's
          getting. His eyes fixed on Liz... her back to him. A glass
          of wine in her hand... her golden hair... the ivory skin of
          her shoulders. Strauss taps her on the arm. She half
          turns...

                         STRAUSS
          Excuse me Madam. Your husband is
          here. He needs to --

                         MARTIN
          Liz...
          Liz turns fully. That beauty. A flash of surprise as she
          sees Martin. His clothes. The suture on his head.

                          MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Oh, Jesus Liz, I --
          Moving in to embrace her... abruptly she steps away from him,
          a flustered look of confusion on her face. Beat.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Liz, I... I was in an accident.
          I was in the hospital, in a coma
          I'm so sorry, they didn't
          know who I was ---

                         LIZ
          Excuse me... do I know you?

                         CONTINUED: (3)
          Liz stares at him, nonplussed. Her group also staring.

                         MARTIN
          Liz...? Please. It's me.

                         LIZ
          And just who might 'you' be?
          Amused whispers. Martin, bewildered, growing angry.

                         MARTIN
          It's me. Martin. Your husband.
          Liz half smiles, glances around. Is this a joke? To the
          security guard, flustered:

                         LIZ
          This is a... misunderstanding.
          I... I don't know this man. This
          is my husband... Martin.
          She calls to a MAN nearby engaged in conversation. Mid-30s
          like Martin. Elegant, groomed, athletic... conspicuously more
          handsome in a chiselled way. Know him as MARTIN B.

                         MARTIN B

                         (COMING OVER)
          What's up?

                         STRAUSS
          You are Dr. Harris?

                         MARTIN B
          Last time I looked...
          He checks his name tag. There it is: 'Dr Martin Harris.'

          MARTIN B (CONT'D)
          Yeah... still me.
          More laughter. Martin pales. A beat. Turns to Liz.

                         MARTIN
          Is this some kind of a joke?

                         LIZ
          What are you talking about... ?

                         MARTIN
          -- because it really isn't funny.

                         LIZ
          joke about what?

                         MARTIN
          Do you have any idea what I've
          been through?

                         LIZ
          No. I have no idea what you've
          been through.

                         MARTIN
          I've been in the hospital for
          four days! Where were you? Were
          you even trying to find me --?!
          Moment's strained silence. Strauss unsure what to do,
          signaling a guard. Martin B steps in...

                         MARTIN B
          Look, You seem like you've had an
          accident, or perhaps --

                         MARTIN
          -- who the hell are you!?

                         MARTIN B
          Okay, okay. Can you please just
          get him out of here?
          Martin rounds on Martin B. Jabs a finger.

                         MARTIN
          You. Whatever you think you're
          doing, you need to stop it.

                         (TO LIZ)
          Liz, please. This is...
          He tries to put his hand on her arm. Liz shies away. Martin
          B between them now. Martin shoving him back.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Get out of my way --!
          Guard GRABS Martin's shoulder. Martin shakes him off. Guard
          grabs him again. Martin elbows him. A scuffle.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Liz --! Please...
          . Martin's hauled back... away from Liz.

                         STRAUSS
          If you don't leave now, sir,
          we'll have to call the police.
          Martin pulling free, steps away.

                         MARTIN
          (loud, sardonic)
          Great! That's the first good
          idea anyone's had. Call the
          police. Call the God damn Army!

          It's not funny. I was hurt...
          Liz just stares at him, afraid, anchored to Martin B's arm.

          TNT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
          Seen through glass. A WALL OF MONITORS show images from
          around the hotel. Inside, Martin sits, surrounded.

          INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - SAME

          Martin rocks in a chair; restless, hands knotted. A FEMALE
          DETECTIVE watches him. An OLDER DETECTIVE is on the phone.
          Strauss sits near him, studying him, while a TECHNICIAN fast-
          forwards 4-PANE video of the hotel reception area, the drive
          in front of the hotel...

                         MARTIN
          There! Right there!
          ON THE VIDEO: Slowing to real-time. Liz, arriving at
          reception, speaking with the Receptionist, gesturing outside.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          That's Liz, and I... I must have
          been outside, I... I can't
          remember.
          The video plays on. Liz thanks the receptionist, leaves.

                         STRAUSS
          As you can see... you're not
          there.
          Martin STARES at him, helpless. The Older Detective hangs up
          the phone...

                         OLDER DETECTIVE
          Immigration confirms the arrival
          of a Doctor and Mrs. Harris on
          November 23rd at 16.37. An hour
          later they checked into their
          suite at the Hotel.
          Martin breathes in. Chooses his words carefully.

                         MARTIN
          He's not Martin Harris. I am
          Martin Harris. The man
          downstairs is pretending to be
          me.

                         OLDER DETECTIVE
          And this impostor... may I ask?
          Did he also steal your wife?

          smile on the female detective's face.

                         MARTIN
          He's forcing her... he must have--

                         STRAUSS
          -- but why? Exactly? .Why?
          There's no answer to that. Martin looks down. A beat.

          This... this is insane.
          He stares at their faces. He calms himself, trying to get a
          grip. A memory resurfacing...

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          My lab number... at Dartmouth...
          Call my assistant, she can verify
          who I am. Call her right now...
          He picks up a pad, scribbles down the number. Beat. The
          female detective picks up the phone, dials. She switches to
          speaker. RINGING TONE. CLICK. A recorded message...

           WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

          Female detective dutifully dials the number. RINGING again.

          Even if she is your wife, sharing
          a room with her is not illegal.
          Not in Germany.

                         FEMALE DETECTIVE
          (German, subtitled:)
          Look at her. Soon we'll have
          twenty more men claiming to be
          her husband.
          The room tries not to laugh, can't help smiling. The monitor
          image flips, now just a corridor.

                         MARTIN

                         (COLD)
          I'm sorry, I didn't realize this
          was funny to you.
          The Older Detective frowns, offended. The Female Detective
          speaks into her radio. Martin tracks, panicking.

                         OLDER DETECTIVE
          Listen... you have no proof you
          are even American. We can arrest
          you only for that.

          I told you, I was in an accident.
          I lost... I lost all my -- Wait,
          what are you doing...?
          The Female Detective listens to the radio response, nods to
          the Older Man who checks in with Strauss.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Oh God... You're going to arrest
          me. You're going to --

                         OLDER DETECTIVE
          On Monday, you can speak with a
          lawyer. Tell him who you are.
          The Older Detective confers with the Female Detective.
          ON THE MONITORS: the image from the Rose Room reappears: Liz
          and Martin B visible: laughing, drinking.
          Martin's gaze darts, panicked: The image. The detectives.
          Strauss. Martin... coming to a decision...

                         MARTIN
          (low, pained)
          I'm sorry... you're probably
          right.
          Faces look over, interested.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          I... the accident. I haven't
          been remembering things, very
          well. Perhaps this is just...
          perhaps I'm confused.
          Martin remembers something, fumbles in his jacket and
          produces Farge's card.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          This is my doctor, at the
          hospital. He warned me this
          might happen. I should go back
          there. I'm really embarrassed...
          Strauss LEANS in, half convinced.

                         STRAUSS
          So... now you are saying that you
          are not Dr. Martin Harris?
          ON MARTIN. Eyes tight. Point of no return.

                         MARTIN
          I... I don't know.

          doctor. Please.

          EXT. SERVICE ENTRANCE, HOTEL IMPERIAL - MOMENTS LATER

          Martin in a humiliated daze as TWO HOTEL GUARDS escort him
          out of a service entrance. Dirty pavement, a few bellhops
          smoke in the cold by a propped-open door. The guards move
          Martin along, out towards the hotel taxi stand.

          INT. TAXI CAB - SAME

          Martin climbs into the back seat. One of the guards hands
          Dr. Farge's business card to the driver, speaks to him in
          German. Door slams, cab starts to move.

          MARTIN'S P.O.V. -- THE HOTEL
          Even as they pull away, several high-end Mercedes are
          sweeping up. SAUDI SECURITY get out of the first and last
          cars, check around before opening the doors of the center
          car. The man we saw on TV gets out. PRINCE FARAD, flanked
          by bodyguards and gorgeous female companions.
          The HOTEL MANAGER and CONFERENCE HEAD greet him, smiles and
          handshakes, they usher his entourage inside.
          Martin tracks the Prince, then FOCUSES BEYOND: A view into
          the hotel bar. Liz and Martin B entering...

                         MARTIN
          His gaze FIXED on them as the cab starts to move again...

                         MARTIN
          Wait! Stop! I've changed my
          mind...
          Martin thrusts a few bills forward, steps out...

          EXT. KONIGSTRASSE - NIGHT

          SCRRECH! A large brown Range Rover locks up tires as Martin
          steps out in front of it. A brief moment, Martin staring up
          into the tinted front glass... can't make out the driver.
          He holds up his hand, apologizing, makes his way to the
          street. weaving back through pedestrians, eyes fixed on the
          bar... FREEZES as he sees them.

          MARTIN'S P.O.V. -- LIZ AND MARTIN B

                         CONTINUED:
          He leans into her, speaks quietly. She nods, intimate,
          smiles and shakes her head. What an evening...
          Liz and Martin B get up, leave. She takes his arm, intimate,
          heading out to the lobby. P.O.V. DARTING, SEARCHING... PICKS
          them up again in...
          . an EXTERIOR ELEVATOR rising up the side of the building.
          The two of them inside. Alone...

          EXT. BERLIN STREETS (VARIOUS) - NIGHT

          Martin walks fast, blind, lost. Miasma of LIGHTS and SOUNDS.
          Frozen MANNEQUINS in windows... the din of CLUBS and BARS...
          sex-shop neon SIZZLING. Nowhere to go but to keep going.
          The river. Martin gazes at the dark water...

          MARTIN'S P. O. V. -- SHOCK CUT -- MEMORY FLASH
          silent free-fall. WHAM! The taxi hits the water.
          The RATTLE of a U-BAHN TRAIN on a bridge snaps him back. Its
          PULSING LIGHTS STROBING like a silent movie.

          EXT. STREET PAY PHONE - NIGHT

          Faint VOICE in Martin's ear as Rodney Cole recites his
          message. Hands numb with cold, Martin pumps in change.

                         MARTIN
          Rodney it's me, Martin. Rod, I'm
          in Berlin for the conference, but
          it's Liz. She's... I'm in
          trouble, Rod...
          Phone issues a DEMAND for more money. Martin fumbles for
          change, drops a crumpled ball of Euros into the GUTTER.

          INT. TRANSIT HOTEL - ROSENTHALER PLATZ - NIGHT

          'Hotel' is a charitable description. Martin counts out
          sodden bills, hands them to a WOMAN behind the desk. She in
          turn gives Martin a form to fill.

                         WOMAN
          Fur Reisepaf3... passport...
          A beat. Martin looks at her, helpless. The woman sighs.
          Pushes back his money.

                         WOMAN (CONT'D)
          Nicht Reisepal3, nicht

          23.

          EXT. TRANSIT HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

          Martin exits, pulling dirty clothing closed against the cold.
          He scans the street, unnerved, frowns as he spots A BROWN
          RANGE ROVER, up the street, parked, idling. He squints,
          paranoid, checks the other way...
          His eyes lock on a lit S-BAHN station across the Platz.

          EXT. S-BAHN STATION BERLIN MITTE - NIGHT

          Martin pushes through the turnstiles, his footsteps echo in
          the empty tile corridor as his eyes play over the
          advertisements. Happy sexy Germans smile back at him... The
          SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS behind him, matching his. He slowly
          becomes aware, glances back.
          MARTIN'S P.O.V.: The empty corridor, curving away...
          Martin STOPS, listens... nothing. He starts to move again,
          aware that the delicate "click" of the following steps also
          begins again.
          UP AHEAD, the corridor straightens out at the train platform,
          several late-night travelers waiting. Martin begins to
          hurry... the FOOTSTEPS also increase in speed.
          Another sound: A TRAIN APPROACHING. Martin gives up cool,
          starts to run as the train barrels into the station, its
          noise eclipsing all sound. Doors open and Martin leaps in,
          turns to face the open door...
          .moments pass, the car's bell signals. Then a MAN appears,
          rushing from the corridor, one hand raised.

                         MAN
          (German, subtitled:)
          Please! Hold the door!
          He's mild-faced, glasses, carrying a shopping bag in one
          hand. He FROWNS as Martin does nothing to stop the door.
          The two men stare through the glass as the train begins to
          move. The man shakes his head: foreigners.

          INT. S-BAHN TRAIN - NIGHT

          Martin shivers with cold and exhaustion, eyes play over the
          few passengers in the car... a nondescript man a few benches
          down who stares at him, then back to his paper.
          Martin eyes him, paranoid. Slowly gives up, lets his gaze
          plays over the adverts. Times, dates... Nov 26th. Memories
          reawakened...

          Has to write something down. Fumbles in his jacket for his
          the copy of 'Horticus,' looking for a blank page to write on.
          A piece of CARD falls from between its pages. Something
          printed on one side. Martin flips it over, scribbles on the
          other: "28th. Bressler. 12.30..." Other times, dates,
          numbers. Everything he can remember...
          Sudden overwhelming fatigue. The roar of the train. VOICES.
          Lights racing by the windows. Martin's eyelids droop.
          Flickering. Closing...

          SUDDEN FLASH CUT - FRACTURED MEMORY...
          . LECTURE HALL, younger Liz in the audience. Students
          CLAPPING. Smiling older colleague SHAKING his hand...
          becoming... bees' WINGS swarming in their hive... YOUNG
          MARTIN watching mesmerized through a magnifying glass...
          their movement morphing into NAKED BODIES. Urgent,
          passionate. Martin and Liz making love.

          WHOMPF! SUDDEN SHIFT -- A HOTEL BEDROOM...
          . Liz towelling her hair. Only now it's dark, and cut
          short. Turns, smiles at him. Face close. Lips moving.

                         LIZ
          Are you ready...?

          INT. S-BAHN TRAIN - MORNING

          Martin's eyes creak open. The train is still moving, but
          everything has changed. Morning passengers crowd the car,
          giving him space. An AMERICAN COUPLE, their bags tucked
          tight. The WIFE staring down at him.

          INT. S-BAHN BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Martin runs water, combs his hair with his fingers. Tries to
          press creases out of his stained suit. He stares into the
          graffiti-stained metal mirror of the bathroom.

                         MARTIN
          Are you going to give up?

                         (BEAT)
          okay. Solve the problem...

          INT. INTERNET CAFE - NIGHT

          Martin sits in front of a stickered and stained monitor, eyes
          glued to the screen as he types in an URL. The Dartmouth
          Mail website appears. Martin types in his login, password.
          "Login failed. Please try again."

          Another attempt. Same results. He switches tactics. Types
          "Martin Harris" into Google... 605,000 results come back at
          him. On an impulse, he clicks "IMAGES."...
          .page after page of men young and old. Getting married,
          posing, partying, historical illustrations...
          Behind Martin, door jingles, a YOUNG MAN comes into the cafe,
          seats himself across and to the side of Martin.
          Martin focuses, tries 'Martin Harris, Phd'... Cursor clicks.
          A new window opens. 'The role of Gorytini and Thynnidae in
          Drakea pollination.' 'Research Faculty information: Dr.
          Martin Harris...' Contact numbers. No picture.
          He stares in disbelief... suddenly becomes AWARE of the man
          across: Young, nondescript, his head bobbing gently to
          whatever his Ipod earbuds are playing, staring into his
          computer... The young man looks over, meets Martin's eyes,
          holds for a long moment, small smile, looks back.
          Martin studies him for a moment, forces his gaze back to the
          page, the negation of his life on a small screen.

          THE YOUNG MAN
          . Glances over again. Martin catching him.

                         MARTIN
          Can I help you? Hello?
          The guy points to his headphones, shrugs. Martin STARES at
          his screen, ears listening for the tell tale sound of music
          seeping from the earbuds... nothing.
          Martin rises suddenly, looks to the bored ATTENDANT who nods
          towards the back. Martin moves past college kids on
          Facebook, to a dim back corridor, a door marked "Manner," and
          what's he's looking for: a back door, cracked.

          EXT. ALLEY BEHIND THE INTERNET CAFE - NIGHT

          Martin slips into the alley, trots towards the street,
          glancing back. No one is following.
          He moves onto the street, waits at a light... eyes lock onto
          the familiar "Ace Taxi" logo of a taxi passing...

          SUDDEN FLASH OF MEMORY --: CARTWHEELING TAXI...
          Silent freefall dive. The 'Ace Taxis' logo... The face in
          the mirror. Looking back at him. Gina. Eyes meet...

          I /E. TAXI DEPOT - BUCHER STRASSE - EARLY MORNING
          Revving ENGINES. Echoing VOICES. Hunched against the
          drizzle, Martin pauses outside it. The playing card 'Ace
          Taxis' logo. Martin ducks under the open steel shutters...

          INT. 'ACE' TAXIS - DISPATCH OFFICE - EARLY MORNING

          The DEPOT MANAGER, a bully with a face like boiled meat,
          rants at Martin in German. BIKO, a gentle-looking Somalian,
          translates. His English is impeccable.

                         BIKO
          He says he doesn't care if she
          saved your life... the bitch cost
          him 20,000 Euros... the insurance
          won't cover the cab because she
          had no license... the driver who
          was letting her moonlight in his
          taxi, skipped town...
          The depot manager's rage reaches a Hitlerian climax...

                         BIKO (CONT'D)
          . He says illegal immigrants
          are destroying German society...

                         MARTIN
          So. I'm guessing he doesn't know
          where she is.

                         BIKO

                         (SMALL BEAT)
          No one knows where she is.
          Martin studies Biko, nods.

                         MARTIN
          Please thank him for his time.

          EXT. TAXI DEPOT BUCHER STRASSE - EARLY MORNING

          Biko exits the depot, starts to tuck in Ipod earphone when
          Martin catches up with him, meets his pace.

                         BIKO
          Hey, American. I'm sorry we
          couldn't help you --

                         MARTIN

          She saved my life.
          Biko eyes him, wary...

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          I thought, maybe she could use my
          help. Maybe I could give her
          some money...

                         (SOFTENING)
          I just want to thank her.
          Please.
          Martin puts out his hand, sincere. Biko sizes him up, then

          Martin. Martin Harris.

          INT. HASIR CAFE - CONTINUOUS

          Berlin's 'Little Istanbul'. A Turkish working man's joint.
          Steam rises around a busy food counter. Condensation on the
          windows.
          GINA picks up steaming food from the kitchen, drops it off
          with two Turkish men, chats with them briefly in fast
          Turkish. There's a bruise around her eye, now healing.
          She moves to the register where a beefy OWNER counts off a
          week's pay and stuffs it in an envelope for her. She thanks
          him in German, tucks it away and ducks behind the counter to
          steam milk for a coffee. Glances up... freezes.

          ACROSS THE COUNTER: MARTIN
          . Stares at her, gauging her reaction. A long moment, she
          looks back down to her work.

                         MARTIN
          You remember me. You know who I
          am.
          She finishes the Turkish coffee, starts another.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          I was in your taxi.

                         GINA
          I don't drive a taxi.
          She takes the two drinks towards a table. He follows.
          Across the room, the owner eyes them.

                         MARTIN
          No, you do. I was in your taxi,
          we crashed. Why did you leave?
          Why didn't you talk to the
          police? Hey!
          She puts up a hand, calming him.

                         GINA
          Okay. Okay. How did you find
          me?

                         MARTIN
          Your friend, Biko.
          (cutting her off)
          It's not his fault. I told him I
          had money for you.

                         GINA
          Do you?

                         MARTIN
          No. I mean, not now. I --
          Gina laughs, shakes her head, tries to push by him. He gets
          in her way. Eyes from around the room track.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Please. Listen to me, I've been
          in the hospital, since the
          accident. My memory, it's... I
          don't remember what happened but
          something is going on and there
          are some people I need you to
          speak to. I need you to tell
          them what happened.
          Gina ducks back behind the counter.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Look, things have been happening
          to me. I think I'm being
          followed.
          That got her attention. Her eyes lift, scan outside.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          You're my only link to before
          everything went...

                         GINA

                         (MOVING AWAY)
          Crazy?

                         MARTIN
          Yes, crazy... but it's true.

          She rounds on him. Patience snapping. Pushes through doors,
          gesturing him with her into...

          .pots, pans, food bubbles. Immigrant cooks work, glace up
          but speak no English. Gina, really angry.

                         GINA
          What do you expect me to do? I'm
          an illegal, driving a taxi
          without a permit, in an accident
          without insurance. If the cops
          catch up with me they'll throw me
          in jail. If I'm in jail, I lose
          everything, understand? If I'm
          in jail, they deport me.

                         MARTIN
          You're not listening to me --

                         GINA
          No! It's you who is not
          listening. You're an American.
          Go to your fancy embassy. Go to
          the Police. There a million
          people here who will help you.

                         MARTIN
          But you know who I am.

                         GINA
          No, I don't. What's your name?

          Martin Harris, Doctor M --

                         GINA
          Okay, fantastic, you're Martin
          Harris. You're whoever you say
          you are. Yes, I picked you up
          and we crashed. It doesn't mean
          I know who you are!
          She backs off, a hand raised against him. He STARES after
          her, the truth of what she's said hitting him.

                         MARTIN

                         (SUDDENLY)

          (beat, softening)
          To the airport. Arrivals. You
          were in a hurry.

                         MARTIN
          But I'd just arrived. It doesn't
          make any sense...
          She raises her hands, enough. He looks at her, takes in the
          bruise on her face.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          You got hurt, too. In the crash.
          (off her shrug)
          Thank you. For saving my life.
          Thank you.

                         GINA
          You'd have done the same.

                         MARTIN
          No. You can't be sure how you'll
          act. Not until something like
          that happens.

                         GINA
          Well... I know me. I jump in
          without thinking. It causes me
          lot of trouble.
          She looks up at him. Meets his eyes square for the first
          time. Then...

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          So please. Just leave me alone.
          He nods. She turns, pushes back into the restaurant. He
          watches her explaining to her boss... Then turns away,
          towards a back door.

          INT. US EMBASSY - MORNING

          Fluorescent lights. Linoleum floor. Martin sits in a small
          plastic chair filling out paperwork. Alone. The place is
          closing early for the long weekend.
          A man opens a door, looks at Martin.
          Martin Harris?

          INT. OFFICE. US EMBASSY - DAY

          MARC SPIEGLER is German, fluent English. Patient, but
          wishing he was on his way home as well. He looks over
          Martin's paperwork as Martin places his watch and the
          "Horticus" book on the table.
          Where the form asks for a complaint, Martin has written
          "Identity Theft."

                         SPIEGLER
          (not looking up)
          Have you contacted your Credit
          Card companies?

                         MARTIN
          No. You don't understand. As I
          explained to the last guar -- who
          went home by the way -- it's not
          about Credit Cards. Someone has
          taken over my identity. Someone
          is pretending to be me. Here.
          In Berlin.
          Spiegler nods, sensing this won't be an easy one.

                         SPIEGLER
          Did you contact the local
          authorities?

                         MARTIN
          Yes. They... They believe the
          other man. I need a new
          passport, papers to prove --
          Spiegler sighs, a mixture impatience and sympathy.

                         SPIEGLER
          Why do they believe the other
          man?

                         MARTIN
          Because... Because my wife. He's
          staying with my wife. They must
          be forcing her --
          Spiegler suppresses a small laugh, looks away.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          You don't think I know how it
          sounds? Let me ask you this, if
          my wife was having some hot and
          heavy affair with another man,
          why not just leave me? Why this?
          After all, we're in Europe,
          right?

          Spiegler burns, nods.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Look, I need a passport.
          (tapping the forms)
          I need the documents that this
          embassy is supposed to provide.

                         SPIEGLER
          Do you know, the things people
          will do to get a US Passport...?

                         (BEAT)
          Anyway, we're closing until
          Monday. If you come back then --

                         MARTIN
          Monday?! They've kidnappedmy
          wife. You need to find out who
          this other man is, you need to be
          in contact with my wife --
          Spiegler exhales, cuttint Martin off. He picks up Martin's
          Rolex, glances at the initials. Looks at his copy of
          'Horticus', the inscription on the inside cover. As he does,
          a slip of paper comes loose, Martin picks it up.

                         SPIEGLER
          You understand, we're not a
          detective agency, we...
          Spiegler stops, sensing Martin isn't listening anymore.
          Martin's staring at the slip of paper where on one side is
          scribbled: "28th. Bressler. 12.30 pm..."

                         MARTIN
          I have a meeting with Bressler...

                         SPIEGLER
          What?

                         MARTIN

                         (COLLECTING THINGS)
          Never mind. You've been very
          unhelpful. Earlier a woman
          yelled at me because I had it so
          easy... being an American. Have
          a nice day...
          Spiegler watching him. Second thoughts. Consults his
          address book. Scribbles down a number...

                         SPIEGLER
          Hey. Martin Harris. Here...
          Martin takes it.

          The professor knows you?

                         MARTIN
          Well, we haven't met, but we've
          been corresponding. He invited
          me here to discuss my thesis.
          Dr. Martin Harris...
          She frowns, rises from the desk.

                         RECEPTIONIST
          Wait here please.

                         MARTIN
          Is there some sort of problem?
          No answer, she disappears into a back office. Martin shakes
          his head, exasperated. He scans the building plan on the
          wall... 'Bressler. L.P - Molekulare Botanik - 305'...
          Suddenly about-turns, heads for the stairs. The woman out of
          the office. SEES him.

                         RECEPTIONIST

          Surreal. Rows of head-height CORN in a large humid chamber
          under bright lights. Above, ancient rusting girders and
          brick. Insects HUM. RESEARCH STUDENTS clip seed spikelets,
          bagging and logging the samples.
          Martin slips quickly in through a door, unseen. Heat and
          moisture hitting him. Above the drone of bugs... VOICES.
          Martin tenses. He recognizes one of them...

          MARTIN B (O.C.)
          Drakea, named after Anthea
          Drake, the English botanist who
          wondered how it manages to
          reproduce when it doesn't appear
          to attract any insects...
          A wave of anger... that's Martin's work he's discussing!

          THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LAB - MARTIN B WITH BRESSLER...

                         BRESSLER
          It's puzzling, one wonders how --
          Bressler stops talking. Stares past Martin B at MARTIN,
          heading toward them down a corn row, eyes burning.

                         MARTIN
          Professor Bressler...
          Martin B turns, sees him. His eyes harden. But it's
          Bressler who speaks first. Alarmed, indignant:

                         BRESSLER
          This laboratory is a restricted
          area. Who are you?

                         MARTIN
          It's all right, Professor...

                         MARTIN B
          What the hell are you doing here?

                         BRESSLER
          You know this man?

                         MARTIN B
          -- how did you get in here? Are
          you absolutely out of your mind?

          who shakes his head, embarrassed. Martin pointing:

          oh, Jesus...
          A phone RINGS somewhere in the room. It's picked up.

          So what is this? Some sort of
          hybridized propagation? There
          are two Martin Harrises?

                         MARTIN B
          No... let me explain. This man
          showed up at the hotel last
          night. Security had to remove
          him. The police were called...

                         MARTIN

          of the hospital. He was in an
          accident of some sort.
          . one of the research students CALLS to Bressler in German.
          Martin catches the word "polizei". A surge of panic. He
          looks around. Sees a straw he can grasp at...

          A single insect was attracted,
          but she couldn't see it. It's
          too small and it moves too fast.
          Thynnidae. It's a kind of wasp,
          but it looks like an ant. Only
          the males have wings. The orchid
          re-produces the pheromones of the
          female wasp to lure it in. It's
          a trick. It's pretending to be
          something it isn't...
          Bressler looks to Martin. Surprised... curious now. Martin
          sees his opening. Hope in his voice...

          Martin frozen as Martin B goes on...

          MARTIN B (CONT'D)
          Twins... ten years old. The same
          age I was when I told my father I
          wanted to be a botanist. We
          discussed that on the phone,

          This is my wife we're talking
          about! My father, whom I loved.
          You may think it's funny, but

          tired of it. I'm done. You need

          TAKES SHAPE. A familiar bearded FACE...

          INT. EXAMINATION ROOM, WALDFRIEDE HOSPITAL - DAY

          DR. FARGE fans a penlight across Martin's eyes. Propped
          up on a gurney. Flinches at the glare.

                         FARCE
          The police brought you here. The
          mistake was mine. I should never
          have let you leave.
          Martin blinks, bleary. Farge talks briefly to the nurse in
          German. She nods, starts prepping a hypodermic at a table.
          Farge looks back to Martin. Explains gently:

                         FARGE (CONT'D)
          Confusion... memory loss... the
          complete or partial loss of
          identity... these are common
          stages in recovery. Some
          temporary, others longer term.
          We're going to do an MRI. Try to
          find out what's happening.
          Martin stares out the window, not fighting, hardly listening.
          A bird alights on a branch.

                         FARGE (CONT'D)
          The mind is like a jigsaw puzzle.
          The pieces fit together to create
          the person we are. With major
          trauma, the puzzle is shattered.
          But the brain's ability to
          recover is remarkable. The mind
          needs a narrative, an identity...
          a soul. Without memory, without
          a past, we are nothing. In the
          coma state, memories are rebuilt.
          In some cases the pieces move.
          In others they go missing. And
          sometimes... completely new
          pieces are found.
          The bird flies off. Martin's eyes track... empty.

                         FARGE (CONT'D)
          Comas sometimes perform a kind of
          alchemy. A patient awakes
          convinced of a reality that was
          previously only fantasy.

          Martin's eyes. Fear. Loss. Anger.

          His hand moves down his body to his chest, taps his heart.
          He LEANS towards Farge.

          .who do you think wins?
          Martin SMILES. Tight, hurting, fatalistic. Farge, almost

          realization that he's not insane. This man is HERE. His
          eyes DART as the other orderly glances over, the man from the
          train tunnel. Call him SMITH. He smiles at Martin, polite,
          nondescript. Ghostly in his disinterest.

                         JONES
          Hello, Martin. This won't take
          very long.
          Martin tries to raise up but can't move -- his arms and legs
          are like lead. He opens his mouth to call out, his voice
          barely a murmur. His eyes lock on the IV bag, the steady
          drip... drip... down the line into his body...
          The two men quickly lift Martin, hefting him face-down onto a
          gurney. One arm dangles.

          upwards at him, the light in her eyes dying.
          Around him Smith and Jones start to MOVE, locking the door,
          opening cabinets, working fast, Martin's eyes lock on: a pair
          of scissors, tucked in her apron.
          Eyes watering, adrenaline surging, Martin WILLS his hand to

          They round a corner, almost at the EXIT... Doors ahead BLOW
          OPEN. Doctors, Paramedics rushing forward with various
          WOUNDED on gurneys. Something big has happened.

          decision, they duck into

          No choice. They exit after the doctor, Jones glancing back
          at Martin as the door swings shut behind them.
          A beat. The covered shape on the gurney starts to MOVE.
          Martin's hand saws back and forth, using the scissors to cut
          the straps that bind him.
          ACROSS, the Old Man tracks the motion... scared.
          Success! A strap gives way. Martin paws the blanket weakly
          away. Feels along his arm, and pulls out the IV. Blood
          drips. He rises up, trying to orient...

          trolley which TEETERS... CRASHES to the floor, showering
          Martin with a CASCADE of instruments and dressings.

          INT. RECOVERY ROOM (ALONG CORRIDOR) - SAME

          ALARMS RING. Emergency team clusters around a lifeless
          PATIENT, working fast. Smith and Jones, resentfully holding
          drip bags. They heard that. Turn, eyes meeting. Set down
          their drip bags. Edge back toward the door...

          INT. HALLWAY, HOSPITAL - SAME

          Smith and Jones, hurrying down the hall. Quick check
          into the patient's room reveals Martin GONE, the old man
          GESTURING, panicked...
          They moves on, fast, around a corner into...

          INT. HOSPITAL E.R. RECEIVING AREA - CONTINUOUS

          Very busy. Patients... doctors and nurses. Smith and Jones
          push into the room, scanning... see:

                         CONTINUED:

          A FAMILIAR FIGURE
          shuffling towards the doors! Given away by the plastic
          bag and the hospital gown showing under the jacket.
          BAM! Entrance doors SLAM OPEN. PARAMEDICS charge in,
          wheeling in MORE ACCIDENT PATIENTS on a gurneys past Martin
          as he exits. Smith and Jones break into a run, trying to
          press through TWO MORE CREWS coming through with more CRASH

          VICTIMS...

          EXT. HOSPITAL E.R. ARRIVALS - SAME

          CHAOS here. Ambulances arriving, departing. Crews slamming
          their rigs closed, taking off, SIRENS WAILING. Other
          arriving with wounded...
          Smith and Jones rush out of the hospital doors, pull up. The
          many ambulances, the crowds... no sign of Martin.

          I/E. AMBULANCE/ BERLIN STREETS - SHORT WHILE LATER
          Cop cars and fire trucks surround an accident scene where a
          truck has side-swiped a trolley-car. Ambulance pulls up
          behind them. PARAMEDICS jump out, one of them pulling open
          the back doors...
          startles as he finds Martin, now dressed back in his
          clothes, a reassuring hand held up, climbing out unsteadily:

                         MARTIN
          It's okay... I'm fine...
          Paramedic would do something, but his colleague's YELLING at
          him to hurry. Just has to watch Martin go...

          EXT. FRIEDRICHSTRASSE, BERLIN MITTE - DAY

          . weaving down the busy sidewalk, buffeting against annoyed
          shoppers. Looks behind to see if he's being followed.
          Nobody. Keeps pressing on, finally arriving at

          A FOOD CART
          tended by a Middle-Eastern Man who stares at Martin.
          Martin eyes warm Gyros and Souvlakis, rummages for money...
          comes out with just a slip of paper with writing on it: The
          slip the man from the embassy wrote on.
          He focuses, his mind clearing: A name: Jurgen. An address.
          It's something.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

          A CORONER's hand slides a zipper closed, past the lifeless
          eyes of the Nurse.

          ACROSS THE ROOM
          The two DETECTIVES from the Hotel Imperial sit with Farge who
          pours himself a drink with remorseful hands. The entire
          scene in German, subtitled:

                         FARGE
          .The man's condition was
          unusual, yes. But there was
          nothing to indicate violence.

                         OLDER DETECTIVE
          Is he still dangerous?
          Farge watches the Coroner wheel away the Nurses's body.

                         FARGE
          To someone who threatens that
          fantasy...? Yes. I believe he
          is.

          INT. S-BAHN - NIGHT

          Metro train car almost empty, save for a few noticeably down-
          at-heel passengers. Martin looks up at the map.

          EXT. MARZAHN, EAST BERLIN - NIGHT

          Bleak, uniform blocks of Communist-era housing. Graffiti-
          covered walls: hammers and sickles, swastikas... Martin stops
          outside one, checks the address on the card.

          INT. APARTMENT BLOCK - CONTINUOUS

          Urine stench. Water pooling on concrete. 'Gebrochen' sign
          blocking off the elevator. Martin climbs the steps.
          Approaching FOOTFALLS, SHOUTS from above. A group of young
          SKINHEADS thunders past him, on downward...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

          INT. FIFTH FLOOR, APARTMENT BLOCK - NIGHT

          Martin presses a bell. Hears it RINGING. No answer. A door
          behind him OPENS. A grey-haired LADY peers out. A beat.
          Martin tries the BELL again. COUGHING from inside, the sound
          of a LOCK. The door half opens...
          revealing ERNST JURGEN. Piercing eyes in a face far
          older than its sixty-some years. Frayed suit jacket, stained
          shirt; grey hair yellowed by nicotine.

                         JURGEN
          Alles in ordnung, Frau Brunner.
          He smiles. Frau Brunner retreats back behind her door.
          Jurgen turns to Martin. Eyes reading him.

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          Come in. Come in.

          INT. JURGEN APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

          Jurgen leads Martin down a hallway piled with books.

                         JURGEN
          Siegler used to work for me.
          Did he tell you that?
          His laughter becomes a COUGH that racks his body. Lets it
          pass, before ushering Martin into a tiny living room.

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          Sit down...
          Points Martin toward a battered chair. opens a bottle of
          cheap brandy, pours two glasses. Turns to find Martin
          looking at FRAMED PHOTOS on the sideboard...
          . a YOUNGER JURGEN in East German army uniform... in a
          large office... smiling beside a Russian-made sedan...

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          The Staatssicherheit. The
          Ministry for State Security.

                         MARTIN
          That's where Spiegler worked for
          you? The secret police?

                         JURGEN
          A true believer, like the rest of
          us. Now look at him. I should
          have had him shot.
          Another laugh, more COUGHING. Hands Martin a brandy.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.

                         CONTINUED:

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          He forgot. Germans are experts
          at forgetting. We forgot we were
          Nazis. Now we've forgotten forty
          years of Communism. All gone.
          But it's not just history that's
          forgotten. It's people, too.
          He sinks into a chair. Tired smile.

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          But enough of me...

          LATER -- SMOKE RISES FROM A CIGARETTE
          Jurgen jots notes in a pad. Hand unsteady, he perches his
          cigarette on the ashtray, picks up the 'Horticus'.

                         MARTIN
          I always have it with me. It was
          a gift from my father...
          Jurgen flips it open. Notices the inscription, the NUMBERS
          written inside the front endpaper. A beat.

                         JURGEN
          These mean anything to you?

                         MARTIN
          No. It's my wife's handwriting.

                         JURGEN
          So, they mean something to her.
          He looks to Martin. Direct.

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          Her involvement in this. There
          must have been something... in
          the past... some indication?
          A beat. Martin shakes his head, at a loss. Jurgen leafs
          on... the piece of CARD drops from between the pages. Jurgen
          picks it up. Martin's notations from the night before in the
          train: times... dates... places.

                         MARTIN
          My schedule... for this week.
          It's everything I remember.
          Jurgen turns over the card. German print. A cheery cartoon
          Uncle Sam: 'Uncle Sam's Bowling & Billiards'.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          My friend Rodney Cole told us to
          go, said it was a blast.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.

          LATER STILL -- JURGEN
          Tapping his pencil on the pad... intrigued.

                         JURGEN
          Passport, credit cards, family
          photos... things like these take
          time to prepare. You say this
          man has detailed knowledge of
          your research, of your
          relationship with...

                         MARTIN
          Professor Bressler. He knows
          everything...

                         JURGEN
          Including the fact that you were
          going to have a random accident
          that would allow him seamlessly
          to take your place? These people
          may be good, but they're not God.
          The question is, why would they
          want to take your place? What
          could they gain from being you?

                         MARTIN
          They tried to kill me.

                         JURGEN
          Yes, did you a favor I'd say.
          Now you have... Redlichkeit...
          Now you know you are right.

                         MARTIN
          Do you believe me?
          A beat. Jurgen pours them both another brandy.

                         JURGEN
          In the Stasi, we had a basic
          principle: Ask enough questions
          and a man who is lying will
          eventually change his story. But
          a man who tells the truth cannot
          change his, however unlikely his
          story sounds. I believe you are
          telling the truth, Doctor Harris.
          A long beat. Jurgen closes the notebook.

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          I'll start by calling these
          numbers again... as you say, it's
          Thanksgiving...

                         (MORE)

          48.

                         CONTINUED:

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          and there's the time difference,
          so it may take time to make
          contact. And then there is the
          question...

                         MARTIN
          of money... ?

                         JURGEN
          Yes. Of money.
          Martin takes off his Rolex. Sets it on the table.

                         MARTIN
          It's all I have. I'll pay you in
          cash as soon as I can.
          Jurgen nods, picks up the watch. Turns it, looks at the
          engraving on the back. As Martin turns to leave...

                         JURGEN
          Doctor Harris...
          A wince of pain as Jurgen gets up. Lifts a tea tin off the
          shelf. Opens it. Takes out a hundred Euros...

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          A loan against your guarantee.

                         MARTIN
          Thank you.

                         JURGEN
          I'll need twenty-four hours.
          Call me tomorrow afternoon. Do
          you have a place to stay?
          A long beat. Off Martin's FACE...

          INT. HASIR CAFE - NIGHT

          Gina is cleaning up for the night, counting her tips, jotting
          numbers in a small notebook. The television plays the
          evening news quietly. In a corner, her boss is tallying the
          days receipts at a table.
          Gina ducks under the counter, calls out to a man who's parked
          in a corner seat, out of sight.

                         GINA
          (Turkish, subtitled:)
          Hey, friend. We're closing...
          The man looks up: It's Martin. He's exhausted, wet. His
          eyes full of need and fear.

                         CONTINUED:

                         GINA (CONT'D)

                         (STEPPING BACK)
          I thought I told you to --

                         MARTIN
          I'm sorry. Please. I had
          nowhere else to go...
          She starts to respond, holds it back. Nods.

                         GINA
          I know the feeling.

                         MARTIN
          I just need to know. The man you
          picked up, the man who's life you
          saved. That was me, right? It
          was me.
          She looks down at him, moved. Eyes track his wedding ring.

                         GINA
          You're married. What about your
          wife?

                         MARTIN
          I... don't know.

                         (BEAT)
          Can you imagine what it's like,
          to wake up one day, and your
          life... has been erased.
          Beat. He starts to rise, collect himself.

                         GINA
          It was you. Martin Harris. You.

                         MARTIN

                         (NODDING)
          Thank you.
          He starts to go. She puts a hand on his arm. He stares at
          it. Human contact.

                         GINA
          Don't be an idiot. Come on...
          He hesitates, then lets her lead him out of the cafe.
          In the corner, the owner watches them go. The TV NEWS
          changes, flashes a special. The Owner looks up:
          ON TELEVISION: Martin's face, caught by a camera at the
          hospital. Juxtaposed next to it, a smiling picture of the
          Nurse. German text scrolls: "Wanted for Murder..."
          The Owner's hand moves, picks up the phone.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

          E/I. STREET / RANGE ROVER - NIGHT
          The Brown Range Rover idles on the street. Exhaust plumes.
          Inside, two figures statue in silence. Smith and Jones.
          Waiting. The engine idles, the vents blow heat. Suddenly,
          an ELECTRONIC SCRAMBLER on the dashboard SQUAWKS in German.

          EXT. BERLIN STREETS - NIGHT

          Martin and Gina walk side by side, unused to the company.

                         GINA
          So, how long are you married?

                         MARTIN
          .Five years.

                         GINA
          Where did you meet her?

                         MARTIN
          Yale... I was a teaching
          assistant. Liz heard me lecture.

                         GINA
          And there's no way she just
          didn't... recognize you?
          He shakes his head. They reach the cement steps of an
          overpass, climb.

                         MARTIN
          .You don't have to believe me.
          It's crazy, I know.
          Gina pauses, stares through chain-link at the cars below.

                         GINA
          Everyone has a story... Where
          they came from, where they are
          going, what happened to them.
          Why they're not happy, or
          alone.
          ( l ooking over)
          Who cares what I believe. It's
          bullshit. All that matters is...
          (pokes his chest)
          Who you are, what you do, right

          She reaches in her jacket. Opens the notebook she was
          writing in. Columns of figures.

          This is me. 2,259 Euros and
          counting. The number's the only
          thing that changes. I reach
          4000, I can buy papers...

                         (BEAT)
          Or maybe I'll come home one day
          and find a stranger who claims to
          be me. I'd like that. Walk
          away. Leave it all behind.

                         (BEAT)
          You could do that.
          Martin shakes his head.

                         MARTIN
          I'd still have my memories.

                         GINA
          You see? We're different. You
          like your memories. very
          American of you.
          He nods. She shrugs, turns away.

          Come on...

          INT. GINA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Key in the lock, door opens. Gina shows Martin in.
          Run-down but clean. Rainwater seeps in through the window.
          Martin sits, watches Gina as she goes to a sideboard and
          uncorks a bottle. Pours Martin a glass of clear liquor.

                         GINA
          Slivovic.

                         MARTIN
          Thank you.
          He takes a sip. Then another. Gina watching him. Muffled
          TV and arguing VOICES in Turkish from the floor below.

                         GINA
          The walls are made of
          cardboard... but it's home.
          Another smile, tired. A long beat. Abruptly, Gina gets up
          and leaves the room. Sound of drawers opening.

          GINA (O.S.)(CONT'D)
          You can sleep on the floor in
          there. I have an extra mattress.

          She reappears... tosses something to Martin. A sweater, a
          pair of man's jeans. Before he can speak...

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Don't ask.

          EXT. INTERNET CAFE, STRAUSBERGER PLATZ - NIGHT

          Night-owl STUDENTS and BACK-PACKERS at rows of terminals,

          line at the counter. Signs in, gets his swipe key.

          AT A COMPUTER TERMINAL
          Moment's thought, Jurgen types Martin Harris Ph.D into the

          INT. HASIR CAFE - NIGHT

          The Cafe Owner is still watching the local news, looking for
          another glimpse of Martin. Door jingles. He glances over to
          see two men, one holding up a POLICE Badge.

                         CAFE OWNER
          (German, subtitled:)
          You guys are quick...
          The BADGE lowers. It's Jones. Looks utterly nonthreatening,
          plain. But the Owner's voice falters.

          INT. GINA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Martin sets the borrowed clothing down on the bed, looks
          around himself as he takes off his jacket.
          Intimate, to be in here. Photographs on a cluttered vanity:
          Old country, Bosnia. Men in suits and women in long dresses.
          Children, a boy and two girls... Gina?

          IN THE KITCHEN
          Gina goes to the fridge, removes a pot of plain stew and sets
          it on the stove. She uses a spoon to pull off a chunk of
          fatty meat. Drops it on a chipped plate and opens the
          window...
          leaning out into the rain, Gina reaches up, slides the
          plate onto a sloping roof above. Excited YOWLS as stray cats
          come running from every direction.
          Gina ducks back inside, pulls the window shut, glances
          towards the cracked door to her bedroom as she ducks into the
          bathroom, turns on the hot water...

                         GINA

                         (CALLING OUT)
          The light's bust so you have to
          leave the door open if you want
          to see anything. Don't worry, I
          won't peek.

          EXT. GINA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

          The RANGE ROVER pulls up outside the building.

          INT. GINA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Martin takes off his shirt, lays it down. Notices several
          charcoal drawings, tucked behind a radiator. He pulls a few
          out. A lonely man in the park. A woman with her child.
          Dark, shadowed... Beautiful.
          Gina clears her throat. Martin looks over, sees Gina
          standing in the doorway, realizes.

                         MARTIN
          Oh. I'm sorry, I just... I'm
          sorry. Did you do these?

                         GINA
          I give you a place to stay, it

          No, you're right...
          (putting them back)
          I'm sorry. They're beautiful.
          You should --

                         GINA
          I should what? Have been an
          artist? Perhaps in Bosnia...
          (beat, quoting him)
          "Can you imagine what it's like,
          to wake up one day. And your
          whole life... has been erased?"
          He STARES at her, moved. That connection again. He looks
          away. Looks back again...

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          What is it?

                         MARTIN
          Your eyes... It's the one thing
          I remember about the accident.
          Your eyes in the mirror...
          He tails off. Face-to-face...
          BANG! BANG! Pounding on the door. Gina motions Martin out
          of sight as she opens the door...
          .It's Biko, the soft-spoken Somali taxi-driver. He grins.
          Tries teasingly to peek past her into the apartment.

                         BIKO
          You got company?
          She puts her foot against the door, inscrutable. Biko drops
          a set of keys into her hand.

                         BIKO (CONT'D)
          Bring it back to my place. Leave
          the keys on the TV. And don't
          forget to reset the meter.

                         GINA
          You're the best.
          She pecks him on the cheek. Biko pushes in the door, just a
          little, but enough to catch Martin, in his undershirt,
          carrying the rest of his clothes, halfway to the shower.

                         MARTIN
          I'm... I'm just going... in here.
          Biko looks at Gina, raises an eyebrow.

                         GINA
          Yes, that's right. I sleep with
          every married American you send
          my way -- Thank you for that, by
          the way.

                         BIKO
          Hey, no need to explain to me.

                         GINA
          Get on your way! Go!
          She pushes him out, closes the door. The stew has started to
          SMOKE. Gina moves it off the burner.

          IN THE STAIRWELL
          Biko trots down stairs, laughing to himself. Passes two men,
          working on the PHONE BOX tucked below the stairs.

                         BIKO
          (German, subtitled:)
          Hey, while you're at it, check
          the line to number eight. She's
          always getting bad service.
          One of the men lifts his face. It's JONES. Biko takes them
          in, their clothes... frowns.

          EXT. PAY PHONE, KARL MARXSTRASSE - NIGHT

          Jurgen making a call, rain dripping off his coat.
          "The Eye". Banks of CCTV SCREENS monitoring Tegel's
          passenger areas. Night-shift STAFF sip coffee.
          An incoming CALL. DESK OFFICER answers. Calls to an older
          UNIFORMED MAN, who picks up, punches a button.

          JURGEN (O.S.)

          INT. GINA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Gina punches PLAY on an old boom-box and a cool Bosnian hip-
          hop groove plays. She spoons some of the stew into a bowl,
          sets it on the table.

          IN THE BATHROOM
          Martin lets the hot water run over his head, drip across his
          face, allowing himself a tiny moment of relaxation.

          IN THE KITCHEN
          BANG! BANG! Knocking on the door again. Gina puts the bowl
          in the sink, heads for the door.

                         GINA
          Just a moment, Biko. And you're
          going to be late --
          She throws open the door... SMITH and JONES press in! Jones
          clamping a hand over her mouth.
          Watching them work is awe-inspiring, chilling. There's no
          wasted motion whatsoever. Their faces calm, observant.
          Jones holds Gina, gun covers the dark entrance to the
          bathroom where the shower still runs as Smith turns the music
          up LOUD, then opens the oven, blows out the pilot light,
          turns on the gas...
          CLOSE ON THE GAS -- A hazy layer, rippling over the floor...
          Smith grabs a candle off Gina's table, lights its wick,
          sets it on top of the stove.

          IN THE DARK BATHROOM
          PRESSED against the wall, trapped, fully aware of what's
          _ going on, Martin. He's pulled on clothes. By looking in the
          small mirror over the sink, he can see the men going about
          their work. He can see their weapons.
          His eyes SEARCH for anything useful, anything at all.
          There's nothing. He reaches towards the small window to the
          exterior. It swings open, revealing the FIRE ESCAPE beyond.

          IN THE APARTMENT
          The gas HISSES as it spills into the room. Smith grabs the
          bottle of alcohol, douses Gina as with one hand Jones
          produces a hypodermic...
          . A LOW THUMP from the bathroom. Smith REACTS instantly,
          KICKS in the bathroom door, gun lined...

          exterior swings gently.

                         GINA
          Terror-stricken, realizing Martin has abandoned her.
          Jones nods to Smith who goes out the door, covers the hall.
          Jones FLIPS Gina onto her stomach, presses her face to the
          floor, pulling down the top of her pants as he prepares to
          inject her with the hypodermic.
          She struggles, SCREAMS IN RAGE, chokes on the gas. Her EYES
          WIDEN as Jones slides the needle in, starts to PRESS...
          . CRASH! Martin blasts in from the fire escape, through
          the window nearest them, catching Jones in the face, cutting
          his face. He tumbles over -- his gun sliding away...

          MARTIN AND JONES
          . Tumble together, SMASH into the sideboard which
          collapses, splintering into the kitchen.
          Martin tries to hit Jones who easily deflects the blow, leaps
          cat-like to his feet, moving towards his gun as Smith re-
          enters, weapon drawn, and FREEZES, his eyes tracking:
          THE CANDLE, teetering on the stove... now falling over...
          rolling...
          Jones, Smith, Martin... all track the candle, its progress
          towards the edge of the stove...
          Jones and Smith RUN towards the door. Martin grabs Gina,
          HAULS her towards the bedroom as the candle falls...
          KABOOM --!!! GAS EXPLODES. Doors SPLINTER outward...
          . BLAST hurls Gina and Martin onto the bedroom floor.
          Martin covering Gina. PRESSURE WAVE sweeps over them,
          burning debris raining.

          FRACTURED VISION... TINNITUS DAZE...
          Fires spreading, the main room beyond the bedroom an INFERNO.
          Martin pulls Gina up. They move to the window and the fire
          escape. Gina begins to slide it open...

                         MARTIN
          No, look!
          She tracks his gaze: Down below, Jones exits the building,
          looks up amidst other onlookers. Wipes blood from his face.
          Martin looks around, wild, for anything, his gaze settling
          on: the far wall. Flames FLARE in, growing.

          they thread through the abandoned flat out into...

          INT. STAIRWELL, GINA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

          Martin and Gina slip out a door, into a crowd of immigrant
          families, other residents fleeing down the stairwell. Smoke
          is thick, flames roar.

          MARTIN'S P.O.V. -- SMITH
          Laying in wait near the entrance to Gina's place. Hand
          tucked in his coat. Gaze RACKS, looking for another way...

                         MARTIN
          We have to go up...
          He starts to pull her, but she's FROZEN, staring in horror.
          Martin tracks her gaze: Biko's body, tucked under the
          stairs. Lifeless eyes stare back.

          EXT. GINA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

          Immigrant families emerge from the flaming building. Jones
          stands next to the Range Rover, eyes tracking the crowd, the
          upper floors, now engulfed in flame...

          EXT. ROOF TOP, GINA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

          Martin and Gina emerge at the top, run to the edge. He
          LEANS... reaching across to the next building...
          BELOW HIM: Five flights down. A mortal fall.
          Martin's hands grip a ledge, pull him over. He reaches back,
          pulls her across. They keep moving...

          Crowds parting as FIRE TRUCKS scream around the corner.
          Smith comes out, the last to exit the building. He meets
          eyes with Jones, satisfied.

          DOWN THE STREET
          Martin and Gina emerge from the neighboring building. See
          Smith climbing into the Range Rover.
          Martin takes Gina's arm, steers her away. Notices an old
          Mercedes Diesel taxi at the curb, covered in debris. Biko's.

                         MARTIN
          The keys. Where are the keys?
          Gina stares at him, lost. Martin reaches into her pockets.
          Finds Biko's keys. He HAULS broken panes, debris off the
          car, manages to get it open. He bundles her inside.

          INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS

          Martin fumbles the key into the ignition. He turns it.
          Warning light delay as the diesel's glow-plugs warm up.

                         MARTIN
          C'mon. C'mon...
          IN THE REARVIEW: The Range Rover, making a U-Turn, heading
          their way...

          INT. RANGE ROVER - SAME

          Jones drives, Smith shotgun. They cruise slowly, keeping an
          eye peeled. Pass the debris-covered taxi, empty. They keep
          moving, gaze still tracking. Smith pops his cell phone.

          I./E. TAXI/KREUZBERG DISTRICT STREETS - SAME
          Crouched down, Martin watches in the mirror as the Range
          Rover turns a corner. He restarts the engine, puts the car
          in gear and pulls them away from the curb.
          Gina still in stunned silence. Wipes tears and grime off her
          face. She looks across at Martin. He glances up at the
          mirror...
          sudden change in his expression. Gina turns, sees...

                         CONTINUED:

          BEHIND THEM -- THE BROWN RANGER ROVER
          Four cars back. Jones driving. Smith riding shotgun. Faces
          expressionless as they swerve out into traffic, deftly cut
          back in one vehicle closer to Martin and Gina.
          Gina turns back to Martin. Eyes wide. This can't be
          happening. Adrenaline clearing her mind...

                         GINA
          Left --! Turn left...
          Martin spins the wheel. Taxi swerves across oncoming traffic
          into a SIDE-STREET. Gina waving frantically...

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Left again! Left again! Now
          right. Here. HERE!
          Just in time, Martin pulls a right. Cab drifts, SLAMS a wall
          side-on... bounces back into the center of the road.

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Jesus!
          A look from Martin: What? Gina glances behind. No sign of
          them. Moment's relief. Turns to her right. Sees the RANGE
          ROVER racing down the parallel side-street...

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          They're going to cut us off!
          Right. Turn right -- !
          Martin SCREECHES into a turn. Heads for the parallel alley.
          Range Rover FLASHES through the intersection just ahead.
          Taxi cuts across feet behind them...

          IN THE RANGE ROVER
          Jones spots the taxi in the mirror. BRAKES, high speed
          180... races back up the alley.

          IN THE TAXI
          Martin floors the gas. SCREAMS out into oncoming traffic,
          across a red light. Zig-zags past cars. Edge of control.
          Zooms through open gates into...

          EXT. VOLKSPARK CEMETERY - CONTINUOUS

          Tree-lined avenue. Closed GATES at the far end...
          . Range Rover moving fast down the street alongside the
          cemetery. Suddenly cutting left across traffic. Bounces
          over the curb, full-speed into the grounds. 4WD slaloming
          past gravestones, rapidly closing on the taxi...

                         CONTINUED:
          Closed gates ahead. No choice. Martin puts his foot down.
          SMASHES through the gates. Flying hinge SLAMS the windshield
          -- glass instantly spidering opaque...
          Martin driving blind. Careens against the embankment,
          WHIPLASHES up, spin on its axis. Rolling...
          over the edge of the embankment, TUMBLING over and over.
          SLAMS DOWN right way up, axles crumpling. QUIET. Steaming
          HISS of the engine.
          Martin's hands still locked on the wheel. Gina next to him.
          Martin shoves open the door. Clambers out.

          EXT. BERLIN RAIL YARDS - CONTINUOUS

          A maze of tracks and power lines below street level. S-Bahn,
          U-Bahn, high-speed ICE trains, freight... tracks
          disappearing in each direction into tunnels. A sound.
          Martin turns, looks up...
          THE RANGE ROVER, Jones at the wheel... SPOTS THEM. Engine
          GUNS, Range Rover plunges headlong down the embankment...
          Whistling ROAR... as a HIGH SPEED TRAIN hurtles out of the
          one of the tunnels. Martin grabs Gina's hand.

                         MARTIN
          C'mon...!
          Running side-by-side. Train horn BLASTS as they cross right
          in front of it as the Range Rover, cut off, SPINS 90 degrees,
          races down the tracks alongside it.
          Martin and Gina scramble across tracks, towards a tunnel...
          . the Range Rover passes the back of the train. HARD
          right, over the tracks. Too Fast. The car catches air...
          . BELLIES down hard onto the next set of tracks. Front
          tire EXPLODES... . Range Rover SPINS... rear wheels SLAM into
          the track. Another tire BURSTS. Scraping STOP, car
          straddling the rails. Jones shifts into reverse. Rims SPIN
          against metal.

          ACROSS THE TRACKS
          . Martin and Gina sprinting towards the tunnel. Smith
          jumps out of the Range Rover, lines his weapon. BLAM! BLAM!

          INSIDE THE TUNNEL
          Martin and Gina hit the ground, bullets chipping ceramic off
          the walls. Up ahead, illuminated, some utility stairs. Gina
          GASPS air, spent. Martin looks behind them...

          MARTIN'S P.O.V. - SMITH IN SILHOUETTE. COMING IN AFTER THEM.
          Martin GRABS Gina, pulls her after him.

          IN THE RANGE ROVER -- JONES
          Jams shift into 'drive.' Pedal to metal. Four wheel drive
          rims SCREAM on the rails, inches forward. Almost off the
          tracks. A vibration. Jones looks around...

          FREIGHT CARS -- LUMBERING RIGHT FOR HIM...
          Shunted by a rear engine; no way the driver can see him.
          Scrambles for the door. Too late - !
          . FREIGHT TRAIN PLOWS INTO THE RANGE ROVER! Coupling
          smashes through the window. Impales the car, CRUSHING Jones,
          pushing the mangled wreck along the tracks...

          INTO THE TUNNEL
          Range Rover scraping along the wall in a tail of SPARKS.
          Smith dives out of the way. Car wreck and freight cars
          THUNDERING past him...
          .toward Martin and Gina, pelting full-speed... almost on
          them... last second, they DIVE into the alcove... through the
          steel door into the utility access STAIRS.
          Gina doubled, gasping for breath... but they've got to keep
          going. Both staggering up the zig-zag iron steps...

                         SMITH
          Jumps up. Sprints after them. Through the steel door...

          INT. UTILITY STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

          Smith sprinting up to a landing. Another landing. Narrow
          tunnel. Booming ECHOES. Rush of AIR. Smith dashes around a
          corner. Slows...

          INT. 'U-BAHN' STATION - CONTINUOUS

          . breathless. Station JAMMED with SOCCER FANS. The bars
          have let out. Faces painted. Singing, drinking, a swarming
          party. A train just emptying, the mass crowding out.

                         UP AHEAD
          Martin and Gina, squeezed together between laughing faces,
          drunken youth, singing, chanting...

          . Both of them in this chaotic oasis. Almost peaceful.
          Gina struggling to catch her breath. Relief. Shock. Grief.
          Anger. Martin, looking at her. He knows what she's feeling.
          She meets his eyes a moment, glances back...
          .sees Smith, caught in the crowd, but pushing his way
          towards them.

                         GINA
          Come on...
          They push their way forward through the crush.

          EXT. S-BAHN TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

          The crowd dissipates into the night. Gina takes Martin's
          hands, pulls him along a street of neon club signs, lines of
          youth waiting to get in.
          BEHIND THEM. Smith emerges from the station, tracks them.

          EXT. BERLIN STREET - NIGHT

          Gina hurries them past bars and clubs. They come to a door
          crowded with youths, Middle-Eastern and Balkan.
          Gina pulls Martin to the front. Unfriendly eyes STARE down
          Martin, the huge BOUNCER nods recognition to Gina.

          ON THE STREET
          Smith stops, takes in the many clubs, the various Bouncers
          guarding their doors. Looks down at his boring suit, nods
          defeat. Turns and walks away.

          INT. 'SHINE' NIGHT CLUB- NIGHT

          The club is barely-lit, punctuated by beams of moving light,
          constant music. The bar a glowing oasis. Gina leads Martin
          through. They pass down through old WWII bomb shelter
          construction, through curtains, into...

                         CHILL SPACE
          Even darker, only small glowing lights, candles, neon tubing
          casts shadows. Quiet almost, only the dull 'thud" of the
          bass reaches them.
          He puts a hand on her shoulder... she pushes it off.

                         MARTIN
          Gina...

          . and she LOSES IT. Flies at him, slapping clumsily. Like
          an enraged child. Martin grabbing her... holding her tight.
          Bodies pressed together... as her anger and fear and grief
          dissolve into sobbing...

                         GINA
          His family is in Africa. The
          money will just stop coming...
          they'll never know why...
          . Martin calming her, stroking her head. Her hand finding
          his, gripping it tight, wanting the contact. Martin looking
          down at the face buried in his chest. Feeling versus memory.
          Gina... Liz... Torn.
          A long beat. Her control returning. And her strength. She
          separates from him.

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          You saved my life.
          No response. Eyes locked.

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          .You never know, what you will
          do, until the time comes, right?
          Martin looks down, unsure. She stays on his face. Looking
          for... Her eyes shift:

          ACROSS THE SPACE
          A young Serbian MANAGER speaks with a female BARTENDER. Both
          cool, young, tough. Gina makes eye contact, heads nod in
          recognition.

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Wait here...
          Martin watches her go, speak with them through low light and
          smoke. His gaze wander... into the strobing lights...

          MARTIN'S P.O.V. -- SUDDEN CUT -- MEMORY FLASH
          .all WHITE. It's snow, drifting down... settling on a
          small idyllic home. Picket fence. Lights glow inside...
          . Suddenly INSIDE. Liz sits on the edge of a bed, glass of
          red wine in her hands. Martin enters the frame, his clothing
          and hands covered in drywall dust.

                         LIZ
          Are you ready... ?
          Liz rubs dust off his face, leans in to kiss him...

          INT. SHINE NIGHT CLUB- NIGHT

          Martin's eyes flick open and the SOUND and LIGHT of the club
          come flooding back in...

          MARTIN'S P.O.V. -- GINA. UNDRESSING
          Low, moving lights pass across her body, wifebeater
          undershirt and jeans. She unzips the jeans, pulls them down
          long legs, pulls off the wifebeater, no bra...
          . hesitates. Looks back, sees that Martin is watching her.
          Beat. Beat. Lights catch glimpses of her body, her breasts,
          the arch of her back.
          She turns slightly away from him, pushes a pile of borrowed
          clothing towards him. A heavy coat, some jeans.

                         GINA
          .Put these on.
          She pulls a mod shirt on, glances back as he now undresses.

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Were you happy?
          He looks up, shirt in his hands. She doesn't waiver.

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Your marriage? Was it happy?

                         MARTIN
          .Yes. I think so... I don't
          remember... how it felt exactly.
          She approaches him, leans in so she can see his eyes...

                         GINA
          So why would she do this to you?

                         MARTIN
          .For the same reason I would.
          If I thought it was the only way
          to protect her.
          Gina nods, distant. Martin presses on, difficult.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          I keep having a dream. Liz is in
          the bedroom of our home, although
          it's different somehow. Her
          hair's different... she's
          smiling, about to say something.
          Then it ends. I can remember
          places, details...

          He stops. Just the low pulsing BEAT from the other room The
          lights revolving over them.
          Gina watching him. Looking back at her. That connection
          again. He looks away.
          She shakes it off, produces a borrowed joint, offers it to
          him. He shakes his head no. She shrugs, sparks it. Inhales
          deeply, eyes close. She leans back.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          You'll need to get out of town.
          There's a man who's helping me.
          He can --

                         GINA
          (seems to ignore him)
          In Bosnia... It was not like you
          probably imagine. It was nice.
          .there were cherry blossoms.

          One day, I was sixteen. My
          sister and my brother came to me
          and said hey let's play hide and
          seek, down by the creek. He had
          ten Marka for whoever won. It
          was amazing, the way he just said
          it...
          Beat. She raises the joint, hits it again. Her eyes open,
          but she's deep in the memory and it's intense.

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          .So I went down to this place I
          knew, under the small bridge over
          the creek. And I hid and waited.
          Not really that long... Then I
          went back home, to find my
          brother and collect my money.

                         (BEAT)
          He, and my father and my uncle
          were dead. And so was my mother.
          My sister was alive... for a
          little while.
          She turns her head, eyes blaze straight at Martin.

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          It was not enough, to kill us.
          They wanted us to remember, every
          day, for the rest of our lives.

          I'll protect you.
          She opens her eyes again, looks up at him, smiles, on her way
          to sleep.

                         GINA
          .Cool.

          CHILL SPACE - LATER
          Gina sleeps, at peace. Martin leans over the one object he
          has left, his copy of "Horticus." He studies the number
          markings on the flap, working...

          EXT. BERLIN VELODROME - DAY

          Vast windowless cylindrical building on the city's edge.

          INT. BERLIN VELODROME -- DAY

          Cheering CROWD; a sound like THUNDER. A massive indoor
          STADIUM, CYCLISTS racing on a reverberating wood track below
          a suspended lighting rig the size of a spaceship.
          MARTIN at the counter of a busy bar. Jeans, T-shirt, Bomber
          Jacket. Different look, to say the least. Across the bar,
          GINA nurses a coffee. They exchange looks, briefly. A
          familiar grey-skinned figure settles next to him: JURGEN.

                         MARTIN
          Thank you for coming.
          Martin glances around, edgy. Jurgen watches him, glances at
          Gina long enough to let Martin know he's spotted her.

                         CONTINUED:

                         JURGEN
          You know, the most dangerous man
          in the world is the man who feels
          that he is drowning. He will
          drag under anyone who tries to
          help him.
          Jurgen sets his newspaper on the bar. A picture and article
          about the murdered nurse. Martin's picture, fuzzy.

                         MARTIN
          (nods, bitter)
          I... I didn't do it.
          Jurgen studies him, hard. Looks back at Gina.

                         JURGEN
          You said you had something.
          Martin feels in his pockets, takes out the copy of
          'Horticus', turns to the numbers on the end papers.

                         MARTIN
          These numbers, are a code. The
          first number refers to the page
          of a given book. The second to a
          specific line on that page. The
          third number to words on that
          line. If I didn't have the exact
          edition of the book, the code
          would be unbreakable.

                         JURGEN
          (nodding, impressed)
          And what do the numbers refer to?

                         MARTIN
          That's where it breaks down --
          the words are the Latin names of
          two plant species... Calochortus
          Albus... and Umbellularia
          Californica. Fairy Lantern...
          and California Bay. Both common
          flowering plants...

                         JURGEN
          Not part of your work? Or
          Professor Bressler's?
          Martin shakes his head. Jurgen grunts. Pencils notes...

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          Your thesis. The one you sent
          Bressler. What was the title?

                         JURGEN
          And it was after reading it that
          he invited you here. Correct?

                         MARTIN
          Correct. Yes. Look --

                         JURGEN
          Did you ever know someone called
          Laurence Darnell?
          Martin looks at him quizzically. Shakes his head.

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          He was a graduate student at the
          University of Wisconsin. He died
          in an auto accident earlier this
          year. He was doing research very
          similar to yours.
          Jurgen studying him closely. Martin shakes his head.

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          What is Professor Bressler's
          relationship with Prince Fahad?

                         MARTIN

                         (SHRUGS)
          Fahad's sponsoring the Forum,
          Bressler's the keynote speaker.

                         JURGEN
          So they're not close?

                         MARTIN
          In a way... they're opposites.
          Bressler wants to end world
          hunger. Open research...
          universal access to all his data
          on crop cultivation...

                         JURGEN
          But Fahad's just a businessman.

                         MARTIN
          They're both progressives. Fahad
          knows we'll need food long after
          oil. New agricultural patents
          are worth billions...

                         JURGEN
          But his progressiveness has cost
          him... his own people hate him...
          the attempts on his life...

                         MARTIN
          He's got balls, that's for sure.
          Another beat. Jurgen slides the 'Uncle Sam' bookmark card
          from the pages of the 'Horticus'... turns it over, Martin's
          remembered schedule scribbled on the back.

                         JURGEN
          There's a cocktail party, before
          Bressler's speech tonight?

                         MARTIN
          It's in our suite. Champagne and
          hors d'oeuvres for Bressler and a
          few of his guests.

                         JURGEN
          Is Fahad going to be there?

                         MARTIN
          Yes. Bressler invited him...
          Martin trails off. Starting to get there...

                         JURGEN
          Martin Harris... with just a few
          guests, in a confined space with
          Prince Fahad. For some, that
          might be a very good reason to
          want to be you.

                         MARTIN
          Oh, Jesus... You can't --
          Jurgen flips his notebook shut. Gets up.

                         JURGEN
          -- I need a few more hours. You
          need to go somewhere you will not
          be seen. Then meet me outside

          We have to go. We have to do

          She starts to pull him away, but he's not moving. He's

          INT. EISNENHOWER SUITE, HOTEL IMPERIAL - DAY

          Liz sits in front of the bedroom vanity in her bra and skirt,
          putting on makeup. The room's shower is on.
          CLOSE as she applies mascara. The Camera searches her face,
          her small gestures, looking for clues... Shower stops.
          IN DEEP FOCUS behind her, Martin B comes out of the bathroom,
          nude. He picks a robe up off the bed, pulls it on as he
          approaches her, places his hands on her shoulders.
          They stare at each other in the vanity mirror... RING! RING!
          Martin B picks up the phone.

          Jurgen hands over a library card. A LIBRARIAN finds his
          request slip, slides two documents across the counter. One
          a printed monograph; the other a photocopy in brads.

          A WHILE LATER -- JURGEN AT A DESK
          He finishes reading the printed monograph. Closes it.
          Looking down at the cover... "The role of Gorytini and
          Thynnidae in Drakea pollination" by Martin Harris, PhD.
          He slides the bound photocopy next to it. "The process of
          Drakea pollination" by Laurence Darnell, University of
          Wisconsin. A long beat. The two titles side-by-side.
          Sudden thought... Jurgen takes something out of his pocket;
          the card that was inside Martin's 'Horticus'. The scribbled
          schedule notations on one side... turns it over: the bowling
          alley's Uncle Sam logo. Jurgen holds closer, studying it.
          His mind clicking...

          Martin and Gina stand amidst a flow of tourists and locals,
          near the entrance to Berlin's equivalent of Central Park and
          its zoo. Across, the Weinhaus Restaurant is a fin-de-siecle
          style brasserie bordering the avenue.

          Why here?

                         MARTIN
          .The zoo. She loves Polar
          Bears. I never knew exactly why.
          Gina nods, looks over to the restaurant. Looks back at
          Martin who hasn't moved. She checks her watch.

                         GINA
          Okay, go. You're going to be

          bordered by green. A labyrinth.

          AT THE PARK'S ENTRANCE
          Gina watches, sunglasses on, as a taxi pulls up and a wiry
          haired man steps out, pays the driver. Lap-top bag over his
          shoulder. BRESSLER.

          FEW MOMENTS LATER
          Another taxi arrives, Liz and Martin B get out.

                         MARTIN
          This shouldn't take long. I just
          need to see what Bressler wants.
          Liz's gaze settles on the painted sign for the zoo.

                         LIZ
          Take your time, I want to see the
          zoo anyway.
          ON LIZ. Memory, or nostalgia, touch her cool face.

          The WAITER offers to take Bressler's lap-top bag. Bressler
          politely declines him...
          The waiter nods, leaves. Bressler opens the computer bag,
          checks on the lap-top inside. Zips it back up. Positions
          the bag by his elbow. Smiles to Martin B.

                         BRESSLER
          I thought we might have a table
          for three, in case you still had
          your alter ego with you.

                         MARTIN B
          No, thank God. I assume he's

          Well, it's a lesson. You never
          know what people will do. All my
          work used to be on-line, my e-
          mails on an open server. A year
          ago, someone broke into my office
          and stole my computer. I believe
          they were after my research.
          Luckily, I split my data up and
          double encrypt it until I put it
          all together and make it public.
          That's why this stays with me
          until tonight's over...
          Martin B nods, starts to look at his menu...

                         BRESSLER (CONT'D)
          Now what was so important that it
          could not wait until this
          evening?
          ON MARTIN B, REALIZING he's been played. A single BLINK. A
          beat. When he looks up, he's cool.

                         MARTIN B
          I hope you can forgive me. It

          EXT. ENTRANCE TO TIERGARTEN ZOO - DAY

          Parents buying tickets... excited kids push through the
          turnstiles under the gilded elephants of the entrance.
          Liz buys a ticket. Passes beneath the elephant gate.
          Martin starts to move forward... then DOUBLES BACK as Smith
          arrives, hurrying, again checking his phone. He pushes to
          the front of the line, pays his way in, eyes searching.
          Martin moves out behind him, hat pulled low.

          INT. DESIGNER STORE/TIERGARTEN STRASSE - SAME

          Watchful staff; soothing music. Gina at a rack of dresses,
          anxiously looks out of the window, staring at Martin B and
          Bressler in the restaurant, a silent heated exchange...

          INT. WEINHAUSE RESTAURANT - SAME

          Bressler in high form, reacting --

                         BRESSLER
          No! God NO! You're focusing on
          the science, but this...
          (patting his laptop)
          .this is history. You open the
          research before it's finished,
          the conglomerates gobble it up.
          In the entire history of human
          development, name me one time
          when business has ever acted
          except in its own self-interest.

                         CONTINUED:
          Martin B catches a waiter's eye, signals for the check.
          Bressler catches this, looks to Martin B, questioning.

                         MARTIN B
          I'm sorry, it's my fault.
          Another appointment I forgot.

                         BRESSLER
          It doesn't matter.
          (jumping back in)
          But see you, you say I am too
          cautious. It's an idiot thing to
          say. I'm a realist!

          EXT. TIERGARTEN ZOO - SAME

          Liz wanders past some flamingos, checks a sign, heads in
          another direction.
          Behind her, Martin keeps his distance, keeps his eyes on
          Smith who's shadowing Liz, one path over...

          INT. WEINHAUSE RESTAURANT - SAME

          Martin B standing. Bressler, collecting his bag and scarf...

                         MARTIN B
          I'm sorry if I offended you, Dr.
          Bressler. I just --

                         BRESSLER
          Don't be stupid. You can't
          offend me. We are colleagues,
          this is good discussion. But
          please, Dr. Harris -- Power is an
          animal, all to itself. It

          ON MARTIN B, extending a hand...

                         MARTIN B
          .Perhaps you're right.

          EXT. TIERGARTEN STREET ---SAME

          Gina, crossing the street, searching the restaurant windows,
          the table empty, busboy gathering up plates. P.O.V. urgently
          searching. Finds...
          . Bressler outside the restaurant getting into a taxi.
          He's alone. No sign of Martin B. Pulls out her phone...

          Liz, following the winding path lower as it descends. The
          sound of a cell-phone RING. Liz glances back...
          .Martin, pressed out of sight against a wall. He SILENCES
          his phone, tucks it away.

          EXT. TIERGARTEN PARK - SAME

          Martin B striding through the park toward the zoo...
          Gina way behind, trying to catch up. Dials again,
          Martin's phone going straight to voicemail.

          EXT. TIERGARTEN ZOO - SAME


          P.O.V. -- LIZ PAUSED AT A GLASS WALL -- GETTING CLOSER
          Her slim shoulders; her hair tucked into a scarf against the
          rain, silhouetted in front of an underwater view. The giant
          Polar Bear swims, inches in front of her.
          LIZ'S FACE. Her eyes, soft. A smile... which fades as she
          senses a presence. Turns. FACES us.

                         MARTIN
          Standing across from her in this protected space. A strange
          numbness. Doesn't know where to start...

                         MARTIN
          . Liz.
          Just that syllable. She stares back, features tense.

                         LIZ
          What are you doing here?

                         MARTIN

                         LIZ
          You're crazy -- you have to leave
          me alone.

                         MARTIN
          Why --?: I have to know why,
          Liz. Are they making you do
          this? Are they threatening you?

          You see? I KNOW YOU, Liz. You
          KNOW me...
          Liz's eyes fixed on his. She searches his face. A long
          beat. Her facade seems suddenly to crumble...

                         LIZ
          I can't...

                         MARTIN

                         LIZ

          They'll kill me.

          EXT. ZOO PATH - SAME

          Smith's path has veered him away from Liz's. Frustrated,
          he's a little lost. His eyes play over the entrance to the
          lower area, other women, also with umbrellas...

          EXT. ZOO ENTRANCE - SAME

          Martin B waiting in the ticket line at the gates...
          Gina approaches, breathless. Sees Martin B. Hangs back
          from the ticket line. Spots a large party of school kids.
          Gina steps past the line, confidently joins the group... just
          another parent. Swept through the turnstiles. Behind her,
          Martin B steps up to the ticket window.

          BACK WITH MARTIN AND LIZ

                         MARTIN (CONT'D
          What are they making you do? Is

          I... I can't answer that.

          everything, I promise. All I
          want is for us to get out alive.
          You have to believe me...
          Urgent look around. Her eyes lock on his.

          My case...?
          She closes on him. A wave of emotion as she's almost in his
          arms, her hands on his face, searching his eyes.

                         LIZ
          Your briefcase. It got left
          behind. At the airport. That's
          why you were going back there.
          You need to find it...

          Martin's eyes. Mind racing. Eyes suddenly catching GINA,
          walking right by. Moment's urgent eye contact. The signal.
          Martin B's here. He's on his way...
          What can he do? He knows he can't stay. Suddenly, Liz moves
          her face to his. Kisses him on the lips. Whispers...

                         LIZ (CONT'D)
          I love you.
          A beat. Martin steps back slowly. Their eyes hold. Then he
          turns, walks quickly away...

                         GINA
          Behind the glass of the penguin exhibit. She saw the kiss.

                         MARTIN
          Cuts up a small path rising up from the Polar Bear area. At
          the top he turns, hiding himself, looking back.

          MARTIN'S P.O.V. -- BELOW
          Smith and Martin B converge from opposite directions on Liz,
          speak at her, close, heated. Smith pops open his phone.
          Martin B GLARES at Liz, almost pushing her back against the
          glass. She GLARES back up at him.

                         GINA
          She's pretty...
          Martin doesn't acknowledge. Each face a mix of emotions.

          .Phone STOPS RINGING just as Jurgen reaches the top. He
          stops, wheezing. An ENVELOPE propped against the door. He
          picks it up. Thumbs it open. Takes out:

          scans of Martin. Studying them a moment.
          Jurgen opens the bowling bag, up-ends it onto the table.
          Bowling shoes, a shirt, a hand towel...
          Taking a knife from the counter, Jurgen cuts around the
          bottom of the bag... lifts away a false floor. Reaches
          inside. The contents hidden from us... a shadow of tension

          gas. Spoons Nescafe into a mug. Opens a closet, reaches
          over a musty clutter of jars and boxes...
          finds a rusted sugar tin. Inside is a single ancient
          sachet of sweetener. A beat, pensive. He tears it open,
          adds it to the Nescafe. He looks up. Listening for...

                         COLE
          The authorities? Jesus, it's
          that bad? A guy comes to you
          with a story like that. What
          made you take the case?

                         JURGEN
          Curiosity...

                         COLE
          Curiosity? Is that all?

                         JURGEN
          Professional curiosity. There's
          not much in this world left to
          interest an old spy like me...
          Cole's face tightens... his back still toward Jurgen.

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          . a few questions I still think
          over. One in particular. From
          when I worked for the Aufklarung:
          our foreign intelligence wing.
          Cole still hasn't moved. Discreetly slips open a button on
          his jacket. Jurgen cradles his coffee, steam rising.

          There was this rumor. Of a US
          based assassination unit called
          Section 15. Freelance, deniable.
          They'd work for whoever would pay
          -- public sector, private sector.
          Second-to-none in their planning
          and efficiency. They never
          failed. What's more, they were
          invisible. They'd strike, and
          nobody would even know there had
          been foul play. It was only
          rumor, of course...
          Cole turning to face Jurgen. Smile gone. Glint of a gun
          inside his packet. Jurgen looking steadily back at him.
          Takes a deep gulp of coffee.

                         COLE
          You had fifteen minutes after I
          called. Why didn't you run?

                         JURGEN
          Where would I run from Section
          15, Mr. Cole? I can hardly walk.
          The edge of a smile, another large gulp of the coffee.
          Jurgen sets down the cup. He wheezes...

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          Before I could get Chesterfields,
          I smoked sixty machorkas a day.
          Filthy Soviet things. Killed
          more Russians than Stalin. My
          doctors assure me I'll soon be
          joining their list of casualties.
          Cole looking back at him, impassive.

                         COLE
          I want to know how he found you.
          I want every number, every source
          you've contacted on his behalf.

                         JURGEN
          And then what? We shake hands
          and you go away?
          Cole reaches a hand inside his jacket...

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          There's no need for that.
          Beat. Cole's eyes flicker. Jurgen's body tightening... the
          coffee... the empty sachet of sweetener...

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

                         CONTINUED: (3)
          Cole looks at Jurgen. A moment's glimmer of respect. He
          doesn't move. His gaze lingering. Understanding.

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          You never think... you'll have
          the courage to use it.

                         COLE
          But we do. The best of us.
          Jurgen coughs again. Suddenly sways. Puts a hand out to
          steady himself. Knocking over the mug of coffee...
          as the cyanide sweeps through him. Trembling hands clasp
          the edge of table. Building force. Shaking. His piercing
          eyes never leaving Cole... through the pain:

                         JURGEN
          Tell me... if he remembers
          everything. What then...?
          No answer. Jurgen's hands slip. He slumps forward, his head
          hammering down onto the table. A final convulsion. Then
          he's still.
          A long beat. Cole buttons his jacket. Slips on some gloves.
          Gently lifts Jurgen's head from the table top, rests it on a
          forearm, as though Jurgen were asleep rather than dead.
          Restoring some dignity to him.
          Cole goes to the mantel, wipes off the one framed photo he
          picked up. Takes Martin's Rolex, drops it into his pocket.
          He turns, casting an expert eye over the apartment... The
          legs of the stove... ever so slightly askew...
          The phone RINGS... RINGS... Cole ignores it, moves forward.

          I./E. "JET EXPRESS" BUS/AUTOBAHN - LATE AFTERNOON
           Martin hits re-dial on his cell. Listens, frustrated. The
           phone RINGING and RINGING. He flips it shut. Gina's eyes
           meet his. A long beat. She looks back out the window.
           Sleeting rain streaks the glass. Endless grey city-scape.
          He tracks a clock: 1:40. Looks back at Gina who senses his
           gaze, keeps hers straight out.

          INT. JURGEN APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON


          COLE -- THE STOVE PULLED AWAY FROM THE WALL
          He finds a section of loose KICK-BOARD. Carefully pries it
          away. Reaches into the hole: The PHOTOGRAPH of Martin and
          Liz, arriving. And Jurgen's NOTEBOOK.

                         CONTINUED:
          He turns up the gas, feeds the photograph to the flames. As
          he watches it burn, he leafs carefully through the notebook.

          I/E ARRIVALS TERMINAL, TEGEL AIRPORT - LATE AFTERNOON
          Cathedral-like, overcrowded. Inaudible PAs. Carts loaded
          with luggage. Watchful POLICE and SECURITY.
          Martin and Gina, heads down under caps, navigate a surge of
          passengers rushing out of the doors, clutching bags,
          competing for taxis in the pouring rain...
          Martin stops. Deja-vu overload. His fractured memories.
          Past and present merging. The FACES. The SOUNDS...
          An AIRPORT SECURITY Man glances over, concerned. Gina tracks
          the attention, moves into Martin, fake-romantic, her face
          close to his...

          GINA (O.C.}
          Martin. C'mon...
           Gina touching his face. Bringing him back. He glances to a
          clock on the wall: 2:10...

          INT. LOST AND FOUND TEGEL AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

          Martin and Gina wait at a counter. Clock reads 2:25. A
          WOMAN returns with a leather briefcase. A name tag on the
          handle. 'Dr. M.A. Harris'. Martin stares at it... reaching
          for memories. The woman checks her computer.

                         WOMAN
          May I see some identification?
          She looks up. Martin's expression distant...

                         GINA
          He doesn't have any. He was in
          an accident, that's why the bag
          was unclaimed...

                         MARTIN
          The combination. For the lock.
          It's 2... 8... 0... 6...
          A beat. The woman and Gina both looking at Martin. The
          woman enters the numbers. The locks pop open. She lifts the
          lid, picks something up. A pause... then her expression
          softens. She turns it toward Martin...

                         THE BRIEFCASE
          Filled with personal effects. Sitting on top a US passport.
          A long beat. Martin's hands unsteady as he opens it...

          87.

                         CONTINUED:
          His photo. And his name... Doctor Martin Harris.

          INT. AIRPORT CAFE -- LATE AFTERNOON

          Noisy and busy. Gina uneasy... watching Martin as he
          carefully examines each item in the case. Everything
          familiar, yet strange. His, but somehow not his.
          a copy of 'Scientific American' magazine, a comb, some
          gum, a Newark Airport parking ticket. His published paper --
          the same edition Jurgen found at the library.
          his leather wallet. Martin studies it. Identical to the
          one Martin B had. Opens it...

          CLOSE -- THE WALLET
          New Hampshire Driver's license. Credit cards. Martin
          fumbles inside a pocket, pulls out...
          . the EXACT SAME PHOTO we saw in Bressler's lab of a
          younger Liz with a younger Martin B in Paris. Except this
          time it's a younger Martin beside Liz-in the photo.

                         MARTIN
          gazing at it. He runs his fingers over its dock-eared
          corners, every bump and crease. Looks up to find Gina
          watching him. A long, awkward pause. She reaches over.
          Takes the photo from him. Studies it.

                         GINA
          Can you remember now... how you
          felt?
          Martin's silence hangs in the noise and activity around them.
          Gina handing back the photo. He stares down at Liz again as
          Gina stands, start to collect her things...

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          We shouldn't stay here, it's not
          safe for you...
          Her voice trails off as she looks at Martin, really sees him
          in this moment. He looks up at her, torn, back down at the
          pictures, the relics of his life, his memories, spread out in
          front of him. He glances at the clock: 2:55...
          Gina tracks his gaze... gets it, takes a step back...

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Oh, God. I'm an idiot. She's
          meeting you here.
          Martin meets her gaze, open book.

                         MARTIN
          .Yes. I'm sorry. Yes. She's
          my wife. She's in danger. I
          have to --

                         GINA
          (nodding, auto-pilot)
          That's good. I'm happy for you.
          I have to go.

                         MARTIN
          No, wait. I meant what I said.
          We can take care of you. I can
          get you money, arrange --

                         GINA

                         (FIERCE )
          Stop. Be quiet. You've got what
          you wanted. You don't need me
          anymore and in case "we've"
          forgotten, I take care of myself
          very well.
          She starts for the door. Martin getting up...

                         MARTIN
          Gina stops, turns. A beat. Sadness, anger.

                         GINA
          One kiss and suddenly...
          Everything that's happened? To
          Biko? To us? -- I know, she's
          your wife. Like I said, I'm an
          idiot.

                         (BEAT)
          Goodbye, Martin.
          She turns away again. Martin, frozen, watches her go.

          EXT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL - SAME

          Gina keeps walking. Pouring rain... ROAR of traffic. No
          look back. She joins the line waiting for taxis.

          INT. AIRPORT CAFE - SAME

          Martin still sitting there. The photo of him and Liz in
          Paris. Sudden decision, snaps the briefcase shut...

          EXT. AIRPORT TAXI RANK - SAME

          Gina almost at the head of the taxi line. A glance back.
          People... vehicles... no sign of Martin.

          EXT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL - SAME

          Martin out of the doors. Eyes frantically searching for
          Gina. In the distance... he sees her...

          EXT. TAXI RANK, TEGEL AIRPORT - SAME

          Gina at the front of the line. A taxi pulls up. She steals
          a last look back at the terminal...

          TAXI DRIVER (O.S.)

                         (GERMAN: SUBTITLED)
          Hey, lady. You ready...?
          Gina's face suddenly lighting up... she can see Martin!
          Spins back to the TAXI DRIVER...

                         GINA
          Wait. There's another passenger.

          EXT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL - SAME

          Martin weaving quickly through the crowds toward her... BUMPS
          PAST a man who looks back, his face lighting up...

                         MAN
          Martin. Martin...?
          Martin hesitates, turns. Sees...
          RODNEY COLE. Beaming smile. Martin stares at him,
          bewildered.

                         COLE
          Jesus, Martin, how are you doing?

                         MARTIN
          Rodney? What are you doing here?

                         COLE
          You called me, remember? You
          left a message on my machine.

                         MARTIN
          Yeah... but how did you know --?

          90.

                         CONTINUED:
          Cole suddenly right up close. Presses a rolled newspaper
          into Martin's side. Cold steel of a concealed Qun.

                         COLE
          Stay one step ahead of me. Any
          move, I'll shatter your spine.
          His voice flat with menace. Martin's mouth opening...

                         MARTIN
          What are -- ?

                         COLE
          -- Go...
          Martin glancing round. Cole jerks him back, guiding him
          toward the passenger pick-up zone.

          EXT. TAXI RANK. TEGEL AIRPORT -- SAME

          Gina looking back around. Bemused. Martin vanished again in
          the crowd. Then a sudden stab of alarm...

          GINA'S P.O.V. -- MARTIN... MOVING FAST
          A man she doesn't know carrying his case... headed toward a
          parked commercial van. Driver waiting for them. She
          recognizes him... SMITH. Martin hustled into the back... Van
          door shuts. Engine starts. A VOICE snaps us...

          . BACK TO SCENE -- THE TAXI DRIVER...
          standing in front of Gina -- losing patience.

                         TAXI DRIVER

                         (GERMAN: SUBTITLED)
          Miss. I ain't got all day.
          Mind racing. Beat. Points to a suitcase a few yards away.

                         GINA
          Help me with my bags, please.
          The driver goes to fetch the case. Is stopped by its OWNER.
          Raised voices. Moment's confusion. Then...
          .the SQUEAL of TIRES. The taxi driver spins around to see
          Gina gone and his own taxi pulling away. He YELLS after her,
          furious. But she's off in traffic...

          I/E. VAN/BERLIN CITY MOTORWAY - DUSK
          Smith drives. Deadly silence. Martin motionless. Cole
          opposite him with the gun, impassive.

          91.

                         CONTINUED:
          Interior goes dim as Smith takes a hard right, into an
          ABANDONED PARKING STRUCTURE, taking a ramp, spiraling up.

                         MARTIN'S EYES
          dart between Cole and Smith. Heart racing. Struggling to
          make sense of things. Cole studying him in quiet amazement.
          Shakes his head. Thinking out loud...

                         COLE
          My God... she's right. You're
          completely gone. You really
          think you are Martin Harris.

                         MARTIN
          What the hell Rod! You're my
          oldest friend! You know who I
          am. It's me... it's not that
          other guy. He's not --

                         COLE
          -- Martin Harris? You're right.
          He's not. He's the guy who took
          over for you after you went
          missing.
          Exasperated, Cole leans forward. Spelling it out.

          COLE (CONT'D?
          But you're not Martin Harris
          either. There is no Martin
          Harris.
          Martin staring at him. Blank. Confused. Scared.

                         COLE (CONT'D)
          Martin Harris doesn't exist. You
          invented him. He's your legend.
          A fiction you created. You made
          him up as a cover to get Bressler
          to invite you to the
          conference...

                         MARTIN
          No... That's insane. Liz, she----

                         COLE
          'Liz'...? Your "wife"? How do
          you think she feels about all
          this? You two were a good team,
          then you go and get Norman
          fucking Rockwell on her.

                         MARTIN
          That's not... she...

                         COLE
          -- they aren't real memories.
          Don't you get it? Martin Harris
          is a fabrication... but you've
          one and filled in the caps,
          invented a whole damn life for
          him. They could write a textbook
          about you! Jesus --!
          Martin's face. Spinning. Refusing to believe. The Van
          SCREECHES to a stop, Smith gets out pops the doors. The
          distant sound of the city traffic, a light wind, whistling.

          INT. TAXI CAB - SAME

          Gina, driving through traffic, searching, no sign of the
          van... then her gaze LOCKING ACROSS THE RIVER, four stories
          up on a parking garage: The white van.
          She hauls the wheel over, Taxi sliding through a U-turn.

          EXT. TOP STORY PARKING GARAGE - SAME

          Martin is tossed out onto the asphalt. Picks himself up,
          trying to orient...
          The structure abandoned, broke. No side rails, just pavement
          to the edge. Trash and graffiti everywhere. Desolate.
          Cole approaches, losing it now. Boiling with rage:

                         COLE
          All that studying... planning.
          Hell, you even had us take out
          that kid after we ripped off his
          thesis. A year of prep and you
          try to screw it up... . we do
          everything to bring you back in,
          but you go on trying to screw it
          up. Do you know how much time
          you've wasted? It's Thanksgiving
          for Christ's sake! I should be
          eating turkey with my kids, not
          here cleaning up after some wacko
          who bumps his head and decides
          his cover story's for real.
          Martin's eyes... staring back at him. Crumbling...

                         MARTIN
          But... I... who am I...?
          A pause. Cole shakes his head, pats him on the cheek.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

                         CONTINUED:

                         COLE
          You. You were my best boy.
          .suddenly Cole SLAMS a fist into Martin's stomach. Martin
          doubles over. Cole WHIPS the gun across his FACE. Kicks him
          AGAIN. Martin on his hands and knees, spits blood. Cole
          glaring down at him. Disgusted.
          Smith covers Martin as Cole moves into the van, empties out a
          junkie's works: dropper with needle, bottle top, cotton
          balls, lighter. Expertly cooks up a fix of brown heroin.
          Draws it into the syringe, glancing back:

                         COLE (CONT'D)
          Look at you now. Nobody. A no-
          one. Just another dead junkie...
          Streak of CONCERN as the sound of tires screeching reaches
          them. Cole looks up in time to see Gina's taxi, rounding the
          ramp, accelerating towards them!
          Smith steps forward, gun raised, firing!

          INT. TAXI CAB - SAME

          Gina DUCKS as bullets pierce the front windscreen. The image
          of Smith, firing, grows large...

          BAM! -- IMPACT!

          EXT. TOP STORY, PARKING GARAGE - SAME

          Taxi catches Smith, carrying into the van, crushing him as
          the two vehicles slide towards the edge...
          Cole is HURLED across the van like a rag-doll, his legs are
          crushed between buckling rows of seats as...
          . The van SLIDES with the TAXI'S IMPACT... front wheels
          pushed off the garage edge... teeters, see-sawing.
          Gina scrambles from the wrecked taxi. Runs toward Martin,
          lying on the ground. Pulls Martin away, arm around him...

                         MARTIN
          Wait! WAIT!
          Martin breaks free, walks unsteady to the rear of the van,
          locks eyes with Cole, trapped, clawing towards the back...
          Martin puts a hand out... and takes his briefcase.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Is it true...?

                         COLE
          Caught, the van TEETERING... Sneers at Martin, starts to
          speak.. Eyes go WIDE as...
          THE VAN... TIPS... FALLING off the edge, Smith's body going
          with it... disappears. A moment of calm silence and then
          CRUNCH! A dull sick crash as the Van hits below.

                         MARTIN
          Stares down at the wreck. Mind spinning... Gina comes up,
          touches his shoulder.

                         GINA
          Martin...
          He turns, MOVES. She chases after him...

          EXT. GRUNERSTRASSE - CONTINUOUS

          Pouring rain. Vehicles hiss over the bridge. Gina catches
          up to Martin. Her voice straining above the traffic:

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Martin! Stop! Martin, what's
          wrong... ? Martin!

                         MARTIN
          . Jurgen... we were going to
          meet... I have to see him.

                         GINA
          We've got to go... leave Berlin.
          We've got to get out of here...!

                         MARTIN
          I have to!
          Martin's face. Blood streaking in the rain. Absolute. A
          long beat. Gina takes a deep breath.

          INT. CAFE ADLER - AFTERNOON

          A cafe looking onto the Kochstrasse, Checkpoint Charlie.
          Rain mists the windows. Mostly empty...
          TWO FIGURES, sitting in the shadows. Martin and Gina. He
          STARES down, lost, shivering -- not from the cold.

                         GINA
          Martin...?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

                         CONTINUED:
          He glances up, lost, looks away. Gina takes his hand in
          hers, presses it to her lips. Holds it. Places it against
          the skin of her neck and collar bone. Stares at him.
          He looks up... the intimacy. From far away:

                         MARTIN
          he told me I'm one of them...
          the things he said... the things
          he said I've done...
          (beat, anguish)
          How can I be that person?

                         GINA
          Listen to me. You're not.
          You're not...
           Martin, looking up at her, lost. His eyes back to the clock
          on the wall: 6.15... Martin closes his eyes. Gina reaches
          out. Quiet. Gentle:

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Martin. He's not coming.
          A long beat. He nods, heavy-hearted. She's right. As they
          stand to go... door JINGLES...

          P.Q.V. -- IN THE DOORWAY
           a FIGURE peering around anxiously .. FRAU BRUNNER --
          Jurgen's neighbor, breathless determination as she hurries
          over. The bowling tote b in her hands.
          She thrusts it at Martin, talking rapidly and urgently in
          German. Gina translates...

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          She's sorry she's late. She says
          Jurgen gave it to her. He said
          that you'd know... that Martin
          Harris would know what to do...
          Slowly, almost dazed, Martin takes the bag. Frau Brunner
          looking at him intently, still talking...

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Herr Jurgen told her to wish you
          good luck... that it was a
          pleasure knowing Dr. Harris.
          Martin looks at her, nods slowly. A beat. Finally...

                         MARTIN
          Thank you.

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          Frau Brunner nods. A pause. Then she turns, bustles away
          out the door, into the rain. Martin looks at Gina. In the
          half light of the cafe window, he unzips the bag...

          MARTIN'S P.O.V. -- INSIDE THE BAG...
          Shoes... towel... shirt... digs down, pushing them aside.
          The floor of the bag neatly cut out. Revealing...
          A hidden compartment. Thick roll of BILLS... Euros, US
          dollars, Swiss francs... and TWO PASSPORTS...
           Canadian. He takes one out, flips it open. An entry stamp:
          'Berlin... August 28th.' Finds the photo page...
          It's him. Martin! But fair-haired, and in horn-rimmed
          glasses. The name... 'Tim Carmichael'... a Canadian citizen.
          The second passport...
          'Rachael Carmichael'. It's Liz... with short, dark hair.
          The Liz from his recurring memory.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          No... No...

          SUDDEN P.O.V. MEMORY FLASH -- HITTING HARD, CLEAR...
          Liz towels short dark hair. Door of a hotel bathroom. Liz
          turning... smiling. Embroidered on the towel... the 'H...
          I...' now visible in detail: 'Hotel Imperial'...

          BACK TO SCENE -- MARTIN RISES FAST
          His chair falling. Gina moves to help, he pushes her away.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          No! Leave me alone.
          He stumbles away, pushing towards the bathroom.

          INT. CAFE BATHROOM - SAME

          Martin lurches in, locks it, goes to the small sink, STARES
          at himself in the mirror.

                         MARTIN
          No...

          SUDDEN P.O.V. MEMORY FLASH -- PUSHING OPEN...
          the door to the Eisenhower suite bedroom... moving
          through the suite... towards the bathroom...

          SMASH CUT -- BACK TO MARTIN
          He puts hand out against the memory, covers his reflection.
          His eyes stare back at him all the same...

          SUDDEN SUPER-INTENSE MEMORY FLASH... CLEAREST YET...
          .Liz towelling short, dark hair. She smiles up. Lips
          moving...

                         LIZ
          Are you ready...?
          .and MARTIN ENTERS THE FRAME, hair cut and colored
          differently. There's drywall dust on his hands and clothing.
          As he leans to kiss her, we CONTINUE...
          .INTO THE BATHROOM... to a wall beside the shower... panels
          cut away, exposed plumbing. Something integrated into the
          wall behind the pipes. MOVING CLOSER...
          Semtex plastigue... circuits and wires... diiï¿½ video
          timer connected to a high-tech DETONATOR...

          SMASH CUT -- BACK TO MARTIN
          Shaking his head, knowing. Tears streak, he wipes them away,
          hard. His fingers find his shirt pull it open...
          .STARES at his own body in the mirror. Fingers trace a
          scar across his chest, a healed knife wound. Three small
          raised bumps on his torso: healed bullet wounds.
          He blinks. His breath flows out of him. Surrender.

          INT. CAFE ADLER - MOMENTS LATER

          Gina, uncertain, with the passport... looking at the small
          photograph of 'Tim Carmichael'... notices Martin's paper in
          the case, the one he was reading on the airplane. Pages
          splayed... underlined.
          Cautious... she removes the document. Opens to the end.
          Paragraphs, underlined. A biography of sorts...

          HER P.O.V. -- GLIMPSES OF LINES:
           "Martin Harris, principle biography... married to Elizabeth

          Gina STARTS, puts the paper down. Martin is at the table,
          looking down at her. His emotions sick, his gaze rotten.

                         GINA
          The entry stamp in your passport.
          You were in Berlin three months
          ago...
          Martin, like a statue. Voice, dead.

                         MARTIN
          Prince Fahad is going to be
          assassinated today. There's a
          bomb in the suite. I put it
          there.
          A long beat. Gina's eyes meet his, brief, scared. Sudden
          shift. Martin stuffs the cash back in the bag. Grabs her by
          the arm, propels them both outside...

          EXT. KOCHSTRASSE - SAME

          Martin pushes them into the alley next to cafe, jams the bag
          into her arms.

                         MARTIN
          Take this... get out of Berlin.
          Gina shaking her head.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Take it and go! Get as far away
          from me as you can.

                         GINA
          I'm not leaving you! Listen to
          me: Maybe you're not the man who
          went into the water. But you are
          the man I pulled out...
          Martin, staring into his reflection on the wet street...

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Martin, there's no way you can
          show your face at the hotel.
          Everyone is looking for you. I

                         CAN --
          WHAM! MARTIN LURCHES UP AT GINA! He SLAMS her back against
          the brick wall, his hand around her neck, cutting off her
          air, literally lifting her feet off the ground.

                         MARTIN

                         (THE MONSTER)
          Look at me. Look at me...

          Gina SPUTTERS, tries to draw air. Her eyes LOCK on his.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          .Is this what you want? Is
          this the person you still want to
          help.

                         (SQUEEZING TIGHTER)
          You should have let me drown...
          She sputters, eyes start to roll back in her head, losing
          consciousness. Martin RELEASES and she drops in the dirt
          water of the Alley, hands and knees, GASPING for breath.
          Martin stares down at her. He picks up the bag, drops it in
          front of her face...

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Pure instinct and adrenaline. Gina grabs the bag, stumbles
          across the street, HORNS BLARE as cars swerve to avoid her...
          And she's gone.

          EXT. BERLIN STREETS - LATE AFTERNOON

          Martin walks... numb. He waits at street corners, crosses
          with lights, moves through the city...

          EXT. MARSHALL BRIDGE - SUNSET

          Martin stands at the broken railing where Gina's taxi plunged
          into the water seven days ago. The tire marks are there.
          The railing is half-repaired, half taped off.
          He stares down into the oily black water, toes near the
          edge... weight shifting... then his knees give. He sits
          hard, his hands moving uselessly, almost on their own.
          Tears flow freely. Sobs RACK his body.

          PULLING WAY BACK -- ACROSS THE STREET
          . to where Gina stands, hidden in shadows. She's followed
          him here. Now frozen, watching him suffer.

          E/I. HOTEL IMPERIAL & CONFERENCE CENTER - NIGHT
          Lit up for the big night. Taxis and limos pulling in. In
          the lobby, beautiful people mingle with the celebrities of
          science. Herr Strauss scans the crowd, watchful.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - SAME

          Two attentive SECURITY GUARDS scan monitors, roll through
          different views of the hotel.
          ON MONITORS: Crowds pass through security on their way into
          the conference room. Outside, a line of Mercedes pulling up.
          Fahad entering the building, surrounded by his entourage of
          security and beautiful women.

          E/I. SERVICE ENTRANCE, HOTEL IMPERIAL - SAME
          The same entrance Martin was led by before. Two BELLHOPS,
          wearing only T-shirts, enjoys smokes in the crisp night air.
          One tosses the butt, reaches for his jacket... it's gone.

                         PASSING INSIDE
          Martin, buttoning the last button of the jacket, moves into
          the hotel. No longer lost. Here to make amends.

          INT. 14TH FLOOR HALLWAY, HOTEL IMPERIAL - SAME

          PRINCE FAHAD, flanked by his entourage, arrives at the door
          to the Eisenhower Suite. Hum of a party from within.
          Security KNOCKS. Beat... Liz opens the door. Radiant.

                         LIZ
          Your highness... we're honored
          you could attend this evening.

                         FAHAD
          (kissing her hand)
          The honor is all mine.
          Liz BEAMS, gestures him into the room filled with a dozen or
          so notable guests. Martin B engrossed in a conversation...

          BRESSLER (O.S.)
          Look, I probably have it
          somewhere... Perhaps my wife --
          BRESSLER, held at the door by Fahad's security, searching his
          pockets for an invitation.

                         BRESSLER (CONT'D)
          I'm late. Very un-German of me.

                         FARAD
          (to his security)
          I don't think the professor needs
          an invitation. He is, after all,
          the reason we are all here.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

                         CONTINUED:
          Bressler steps in, takes Liz's outstretched hand. He looks
          her up and down. Matter-of-fact.

                         BRESSLER
          Now I can see why somebody would
          pretend to be Martin.
          Liz laughs, her face lighting up... then chillincj as
          Bressler's TWO DAUGHTERS appear behind him, smiling shy.

                         LIZ
          .I didn't realize the girls
          were coming this evening.

                         FAHAD
          But of course. Lily and Laurel
          are the real reason any of us put
          up with Leo at all.
          Fahad bends down and the girls run to him, a familiar face.
          Fahad hoists one up, takes the other by the hand.
          ON LIZ. Hard beat. Looking to Martin B who stares back,
          cool. Liz nods, accepting the casualties. She takes
          Bressler's coat, reaches for his computer bag.

                         LIZ
          Let me take these...
          Bressler hesitates a moment, then lets go...

                         BRESSLER
          Separation anxiety. Just leave
          it there, if you could.
          He gestures to a sideboard in open sight.

                         LIZ
          Of course...

          LIZ -- WITH HIS BAG
          She turns, hangs up his coat. As she does so... her fingers
          slip inside the laptop bag. Slide a tiny Bluetooth
          connection card into the computer's bus port.
          Liz turns away. Smile gone. Moves down the hall towards...

                         BATHROOM
          Same P.O.V. we've seen in Martin's flashes. SMASH CUT...

          INSIDE THE BATHROOM WALL
          The BOMB. Semtex... circuit boards... a TIMER vamped from a
          DIGITAL VIDEO RECORDER. A sleeping monster.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.

          INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - SAME

          The Security Guard on the monitors squints, watches a
          "Bellhop" moving down a hall. Something about the way he
          moves... ZOOMING in on him.

                         SECURITY GUARD
          (German, subtitled:)
          Where is Herr Strauss...?

          INT. EISENHOWER SUITE BEDROOM - SAME

          Liz closes and locks the door. Sits at the desk at another
          laptop, firewire plugged into a Linksys antenna.

          CLOSE -- THE COMPUTER
          Liz's fingers tap the keyboard. The 'desk-top' divides in
          two... files headlined in German; Bressler's computer.
          'Password blank' pops up. First encryption.
          Liz opens a new copy of 'Horticus' to a marked page. Finds
          the words. Types in: 'Calochortus albus'. Another 'password
          blank' flashes up. Second encryption. Liz types:
          'Umbellularia Californica'. Screen blanks, then refreshes.
          Padlock icon gone... Liz quickly drags them across to her
          desktop. Spinning egg-timer symbol. Files transferring...

          INT. 14TH FLOOR, HOTEL IMPERIAL - SAME

          Elevator doors open, letting out a few guests and Martin. An
          arrow indicates "EISENHOWER SUITE."
          He starts to move, clearing a corner, up ahead the entrance
          to the suite... OOOFF! The wind taken out of him as four
          BURLY MEN in suits SCOOP him by his arms...

          INT. EISENHOWER SUITE - BEDROOM - SAME

          Egg-timer disappears... 'file transfer complete'. Liz shuts
          the laptop. Slips it in a case.
          She picks up the REMOTE CONTROL for the suite's plasma TV.
          Selects 'Menu', thumbs in a ten digit code. Points the
          remote at the wall. Tight pause... Presses 'enter'.

          INSIDE THE BATHROOM WALL -- THE DIGITAL TV TIMER

          SUDDENLY COMES ALIVE, 00:08:00, 00:07:59, 00:07:58...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.

          INT. EISENHOWER SUITE - SAME

          Bressler's daughters, shyness gone, play hide--n--seek amidst
          the grown ups. Bressler steps away from Fahad, heads over to
          his computer. Stops as Liz comes out of the bedroom.

          BRESSLER (O.S.)
          Ah, Mrs. Harris...

                         LIZ
          Checking on your baby again?

                         BRESSLER
          I can't help it.

                         LIZ
          Why don't you just wear it? As a
          nerdy accessory? Here, turn
          around.
          Liz picks up the bag. Adjusts the strap... slipping out the
          Bluetooth. Places the bag over Bressler's shoulders.

                          LIZ (CONT'D)
           There. Perfect.

          TIMER COUNTING DOWN: 00:05.12., 00:05:11...

          INT. 14TH FLOOR HALLWAY, HOTEL IMPERIAL - NIGHT

          Elevator doors open on an ELEGANT COUPLE who step forward
          revealing... Gina, at the back at the elevator. She's
          transformed: An elegant designer dress, plunging neckline.
          As she moves forward, toned legs flash from a high slit in
          the dress. She's graceful, beautiful, heads turn...

          INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - SAME

          Martin is pushed roughly into a chair facing a displeased
          HERR STRAUSS. A GUARD handcuffs his wrist to the chair.

                         MARTIN
          You're not listening! There is a
          bomb, in the Eisenhower Suite. I
          put it there.

                         STRAUSS
          But isn't that the suite 'you'
          are staying in, 'Dr. Harris'...?
          Or wait, you're not Dr. --

                         MARTIN
          I've told you! There's no time
          to explain this...

          104.

                         CONTINUED:
          Strauss rises, starts to turn away. Martin's gaze lands on
          one of the VIDEO MONITORS. Eyes lock:
          P.O.V. -- ON THE MONITOR: Gina, beautiful, approaching the
          Eisenhower Suite.

                          MARTIN (CONT'D)

                         (SUDDENLY)
          I can prove it. Pull up your
          lobby recordings from August 27
          of this year.
          Strauss, startled by the ferocity in Martin's voice.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Do it. NOW. Do it or many
          people will die. I'm not lying.
          A beat... Strauss nods to one of his technicians who starts
          to type into a console...

          INT. 14TH FLOOR HALLWAY, HOTEL IMPERIAL - NIGHT

          Gina reaches the door to the suite, stopped by security.

                         SECURITY GUARD
          Invitation?
          She meets the guard's gaze with cool superiority. Her eyes
          flick to Fahad across the room.

                         GINA
          Are you serious...? Why don't
          you ask the Prince?
          The guard hesitates, unsure... it's all she needs. She moves
          by him, into the room.

          INT. EISNENHOWER SUITE - SAME

          Gina quickly takes in the suite. Far away, Bressler and
          Fahad, engrossed in conversation. One of Bressler's
          daughters, LILY, peeking out from under a table. At the bar,
          Martin B, drinks in his hands, turning towards her...
          She turns towards a picture window, watches the reflection...

                         MARTIN B
          . makes eye contact with Liz across the room, she heads
          towards the back. He begins to follow... hesitates...
          He looks back, to the picture windows. Empty now.

          INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

          Martin, sweating, nervous, eyes flicking to the monitors as
          the technician brings up the reception video, starts fast-
          forwarding through footage. Images go by, almost too fast...

                         STRAUSS
          .What exactly are you hoping to
          find?
          Martin ignores him, his eyes TRACKING.

          INT. EISENHOWER SUITE - CONTINUOUS

          Fahad finishes a joke. Laughter. Martin B still scanning
          the room... Gives up, turns to meet Liz already there with
          their computer case and a sportsbag. She hands him the
          sportsbag, they wordlessly leave through the rear door...

          INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Unseen by anyone, a monitor shows Liz and Martin B, entering
          an emergency stairwell, hurrying. Martin's eyes scan...

                         MARTIN
          There! Stop!
          The technician freezes the image: A dapper couple, checking
          in. He wears a sportsjacket, light-haired, horn-rimmed
          glasses. She's got short dark hair.
          Martin points. Strauss leans in, sensing it.

          INT. EISNENHOWER SUITE - CONTINUOUS

          Gina approaches Bressler and Prince Fahad, intense, urgent.
          Fahad's SECURITY reads her expression, GRABS her arm.

                         GINA

                         (CALLING OUT)
          Sir! Your highness! You're in
          danger here. There is a bomb in
          this room!
          Bressler and the Prince look over, confused, interested...
          . and Fahad's Security ACTS. A gun lined on Gina, pushing
          her back. Two men grab the Prince, pushing back other
          guests, hustle him toward the suite's emergency exit,.

          Champagne crystal, hors d'oeuvres and furniture FLYING.
          Fahad in the middle, looking back as he's swept out, captive
          to his own security...

          INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

          The image ROLLS FORWARD, slowly: The man at the counter
          kisses his wife's hair, glances upwards... It's MARTIN.

                         MARTIN

                         (QUIET)
          Do you see...?
          Beat. Beat. And then MOTION on the monitors: The Prince
          and his detail, rushing down a corridor. Strauss tracks...

                         STRAUSS
          (German, subtitled:)
          Sound an alarm. Evacuate the

          (to 2 of his men)
          You and-you, you're with me.
          We'll meet the Prince at the
          loading docks.
          (to a Guard)
          You, take him downstairs.
          Strauss and his men flood out. The guard pulls keys, starts
          to uncuff Martin from his chair.

          Martin B the computer, takes the sportsbag from him.

                         LIZ
          Stop the timer. I'll finish it.
          Martin B nods, takes the stairs back up two at a time,
          shouldering his way past the folk streaming downward...

          ALARMS BLARE! Lights flash. Guests press out. A German
          voice comes over speakers, advising people to leave...
          Gina moves towards the exit, turns to see Bressler standing
          in the middle of the room, one daughter in his arms,
          frantically searching for the second.

          Professor! Over here!
          Gina at the table she saw Lily at before, lifts the
          tablecloth to find a frightened little girl staring back.

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          It's okay, come on...
          The girl, convinced, swept into Gina's arms. She and
          Bressler head for the door, each carrying a child.

          Guard begins to cuff one of Martin's arms. Martin faces the

          Strauss at the loading dock, hustle Fahad into a Limousine...
          ANOTHER MONITOR: Martin B, rushing back upstairs.
          Martin watches... interested... eyes track... narrow.
          ANOTHER MONITOR: Gina and Bressler, running into a corridor
          with the two girls. Martin smiles a little, relieved...

                         MARTIN
          Lily, Laurel...

          He SCANS the many monitors, LOCKS onto: Liz, moving down a
          corridor, purposeful.

          Fahad was never the target. It's
          Bressler! You have to tell
          Strauss! They're after Bressler!

                         CONTINUED:
          The guard shoves him against the console, starts to cuff his
          other arm. Martin LURCHES back, both of them tumbling over.
          Martin scrambles for the door...

          INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

          Martin stumbles out into a crush of panicked stragglers,
          ducks down, lost in the press. Moments after, the guard
          appears at the door, speaking into his radio...

          INT. EISENHOWER SUITE - CONTINUOUS

          Martin B rushes into the room. Stops. Like Pompeii: a party
          abandoned. Furniture upended. Guests. All gone.
          Urgently searching for the remote. Down on his hands and
          knees. Looks at his watch. Pales...

          INTO THE BATHROOM -- MARTIN B
          . KICKS at the wall. No good. RIPS the heavy cistern lid
          off the top of the toilet. SMASHES it against the plaster.
          Dents... dust... beginning to give...

          INT. LOBBY, HOTEL IMPERIAL - CONTINUOUS

          Gina and Bressler come out onto the floor with the girls,
          heading to the bottleneck at the exits...

                         BEYOND THEM
          LIZ, moving purposefully towards the group, closing, her hand
          in the unzipped top of the sportsbag slung over her shoulder.
          Glimpse of an oiled-black Uzi machine pistol.

          FAR ACROSS THE LOBBY
          The other direction. Martin appears, handcuff dangling from
          one wrist. He SCANS frantic through the bottlenecked crowds.
          SEES Gina and Bressler! Martin starts forward, ducks back as
          Strauss re-enters, commanding his security.

                         BEHIND THEM
          Liz closes, tracking, finger flicks off Uzi's safety.

                         MARTIN
          Gina1 Gina!
          MARTIN is moving, pressing through crowds.

                         CONTINUED:
          Gina hears his voice, can't find him through the crowds as
          next to her Bressler comforts his daughters as BEHIND THEM
          Liz moves closer, closer...
          . Suddenly seeing Martin. A decision, sudden SHIFT. Liz
          passes, brushing Gina lightly as she goes.
          GINA, registering the touch, looks up at the woman walking
          away from her now recognizing Martin, pressing through the
          crowd towards her. Gina's face lighting up!
          MARTIN, pushes by a group of people, closing towards Gina and
          suddenly Liz is in his arms, grasping him, romantic...

                         LIZ

                         (LOUD)
          Oh thank God you're here!
          Martin stares at her in horror as she beams up at him. One
          hand caressing his cheek...
          .her other hand pressing a knife against his chest.

                         GINA
          Seeing Martin and Liz, embracing. Confused. Alarmed. Hurt.

          LIZ AND MARTIN
          Liz still hugging him tight, whispering hard, her free hand
          sliding something metallic into his pocket.

                         LIZ (CONT'D)
          Hello, Martin. I just placed a
          gun in your jacket pocket. One
          bullet. There's really only one
          person, one right way to kill
          Bressler now, isn't there? The
          crazy man whose been stalking
          him, the crazy man who pretended
          to be Martin Harris...

                         MARTIN
          No...

                         LIZ
          Oh, and after you've shot him,
          point the gun at the Police.

                         MARTIN
          I won't do it...

                         LIZ
          God you're weak. The 'Martin' I
          knew wouldn't have been able to
          go on living like you are.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          Her eyes duck, purposeful, he tracks her gaze. Sees the Uzi
          in the sportsbag...

                         LIZ (CONT'D)
          I'll kill them all. Bressler,
          the girls... your new girlfriend,
          and whoever tries to stop me.
          Look at it this way: I'm giving
          you a chance to save most of
          them. You can be the hero...
          A kiss, sexy. Gina in the background, taking a step back...

                         LIZ (CONT'D)
          Ooops, bet you wish you could
          explain that. Time's up, Martin.
          Go finish what you came to Berlin
          for in the first place.
          On Martin. Caught. No play. He turns, walks...

          INT. BATHROOM, EISENHOWER SUITE - CONTINUOUS

          Martin B has a small hole opened up. He can see the digital
          timer. 00:00:14, 00:00:13...
          Jams his hand into the hole. Trying to force it past the
          narrow opening. Desperately feeling for the controls.

          INT. LOBBY, HOTEL IMPERIAL - CONTINUOUS

          Martin, on a suicide mission. Walks in a daze towards Gina,
          Bressler beyond. His hand moves into his pocket.
          Gina, stepping forward...

                         GINA
          Martin...? Martin?
          He STARES at her. Tears in his eyes...

          REAR ENTRANCE TO THE LOBBY
          Strauss re-enters, commanding his security. STOPS as he
          recognizes Martin, mouths words to his men...

          INT. BATHROOM, EISENHOWER SUITE - CONTINUOUS

          Martin B, forcing his arm further. Fingers reach the
          controls... search for the right one...

          .his finger flips a small switch. The timer... STOPS.
          Martin B sighs, breathes hard. Holy shit that was close.

          INT. LOBBY, HOTEL IMPERIAL - CONTINUOUS

          Martin and Gina, locked, staring. Her face a million
          questions... No answers. Martin shakes his head, turns away
          from her, towards Bressler, his hand coming out of his pocket
          with the gun... In Martin's face: horror, deadly
          conviction... Time SLOOOWS. Sound AMPLIFIES...

          STRAUSS AND HIS MEN
          .Seeing the gun. Shouting! Weapons being drawn!

                         GINA
          Also seeing the gun. A hand going out, a scream building...

                         MARTIN
          Bringing the Vun up, pointed at Bressler's head, perfect kill
          shot. No choice. Finger on the trigger...

          INT. BATHROOM, EISENHOWER SUITE - CONTINUOUS

          Martin B stands, dusts off his coat, starts to walk out of
          the bathroom... "crunch" he steps on something. A soft
          "beep." He looks down, REACTS to: The remote control...
          under his foot.

          VISION RACKS TO THE BOMB: 00:00:02., 00:00:01...

                         MARTIN B
          Fuck...

          KABOOM!!! WHITE OUT BLAST
          as the bomb DETONATES. Martin B atomized. Sheets of
          flame bursting through windows.

          INT. LOBBY, HOTEL IMPERIAL - CONTINUOUS

          KA-BOOM! The blast ROCKS the room. People tumble,
          chandelier falls. KER-ASH!
          LIZ dives aside as a column SLAMS down near her. SPRINKLERS
          burst on. Water rains down. Main lights black out... beat,
          then emergency lights come on. Total CHAOS. Find...
          BRESSLER, clutching his DAUGHTERS as SECURITY reaches them,
          surrounding them, searching for signs of Martin...

          GINA, dazed, bleeding, picks herself up. Searching the room
          for Martin... gone.

          INT. KITCHEN. HOTEL IMPERIAL -_CONTINUOUS

          Food-laden serving carts, cook-tops, pots and pans, knives.
          Falling plaster and debris... deserted.
          Liz walks through, brisk, angry. Dress torn, a cut across
          her forehead. She stops at a disposal chute, disposes of the
          sportsbag. Reaches high under her dress, comes out with a
          knife, starts to toss it as well...
          .She STOPS. Looks up, into the distorted mirror of the
          stainless steel surface in front of her.

                         LIZ
          .Hello, Martin.
          REVOLVING... to find Martin there. Bleeding, hurt, covered
          is debris, but holding the gun on her in unsteady hands.

                         LIZ (CONT'D)
          Be careful, that might go off.
          She turns to face him. Hair slicked, clothes drenched.
          Stunning despite everything

                         LIZ (CONT'D)
          Five years as a team... and you
          end it like this.
          Her hand almost casually moves back, the knife still seated
          in her palm. Martin tracks it, steadies the gun.

                         MARTIN
          Don't. Keep your hands where I
          can see them. Please...
          GROANING from the hotel structure. Plaster and cables fall,
          SPARK across the floor. Martin FLINCHES, tries to keep
          steady. Liz is steady, cool. Laughs a little.

                         LIZ
          You know, working with you... it
          almost wasn't work. We were so
          good... You, were so good. At
          the job. At other things...
          She smiles a little, warming.

                         LIZ (CONT'D)
          Don't you want to know your real
          name?

                         MARTIN
          Let go of the knife, Liz.

                         LIZ
          'Liz?'... Don't you want to know
          y real name? Don't you still
          want... me?
          She leans forward, just a breath. Warmth radiating, Martin
          stepping back...

                         MARTIN
          Please, just stop, Liz...
          Her face, reading him. His fear, his uncertainty... She
          smiles, just a little... Liz throws the knife! Martin FIRES
          as the blade sinks into him, sending him reeling back onto
          the floor.

                         MARTIN
          His hand going to the knife sunk in his shoulder, SCREAMING
          in agony as he rips it out, looking up at...

                         LIZ
          A soft distance in her face. A small hole in her chest, just
          below her beautiful collar bone. Her eyes find him, focus,
          smile...

                         LIZ
          You'll never know. You'll never
          know who you are...
          A long beat. We're not sure when exactly the life goes out
          of her eyes. Finally, Martin pulls himself forward. Gently
          closes her eyelids.

          EXT. HOTEL IMPERIAL - NIGHT

          Police keeping people back. FIRE TRUCKS everywhere, jets of
          water fighting back the flames. A collective GASP...
          as the bomb-damaged corner of the hotel starts to FOLD
          INWARD in a spray of dust and smoke.

                         GINA
          moves through the crowd, anxiously searching the stream of
          people still pouring from the building...
          She JUMPS as a hand takes her arm. Turns her. Martin. she
          stumbles back, hands raised against him. Fear, betrayal,
          love... Him standing there, empty, bleeding...

                         CONTINUED:
          Gut instinct wins. She takes a step towards him, he pulls
          her tight to him. Holds on. All he has. All he knows.

          IN THE MIDDLE DISTANCE
          Hotel survivors... Bressler: shaken, oblivious that he's the
          epicenter and object of the destruction all around him...

          platform to board an inter-Europe express -- families,
          business travelers, soldiers on leave... ordinary people...
          another day in their lives...

          They say your whole life flashes
          before you... but it's the little
          things... the details...
          Gina reaches out, takes Martin's arm. Draws him closer.

          MARTIN (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          I don't know who I am now, what I
          would have done. But one thing's
          for sure... I'm not the man I
          was. And I'm going to try my
          best to find some sort of
          redemption, for what he did.
          Because maybe, just maybe...
          Slowly we LOSE THEM among the sea of bobbing heads...

          MARTIN (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          I can become the man I was
          always meant to be.

                    civilized humanity: a lost world in
                    South America! Lurking in the
                    shadow of majestic Paradise Falls,
                    it sports plants and animals
                    undiscovered by science. Who would
                    dare set foot on this inhospitable
                    summit?

          
          A painted portrait of a dashing young adventurer.

                    Why, our subject today: Charles
                    Muntz!

          A massive DIRIGIBLE descends on an airfield.

          

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    The beloved explorer lands his
                    dirigible, the "Spirit of
                    Adventure," in New Hampshire this
                    week, completing a year long
                    expedition to the lost world!

          

          

          INT. MOVIE THEATRE - CONTINUOUS

          Of everyone watching in the modest, small town theater, no
          one is more enthralled than 8 year old CARL FREDRICKSEN.

          

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                    This lighter-than-air craft was
                    designed by Muntz himself, and is
                    longer than 22 Prohibition paddy-
                    wagons placed end to end.

          Young Carl stares, mouth agape, wearing leather flight helmet
          and goggles -- just like his idol on the silver screen.

          

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    And here comes the adventurer now!

          

                                                                     2.

          

          
          NEWSREEL FOOTAGE: the dashing Muntz descends down the
          gangplank to the delight of the crowd. His dogs trail him.

          

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    Never apart from his faithful dogs,
                    Muntz conceived the craft for
                    canine comfort! It's a veritable
                    floating palace in the sky...

          
          An opulent dining room.

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    ...complete with doggie bath and
                    mechanical canine walker.

          
          One dog runs suffers through mechanized bath time, while a
          second wears an electrode helmet and runs on a treadmill.

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    And Jiminy Cricket, do the locals
                    consider Muntz the bee's knees!
                    And how!

          
          Cameras flash as Muntz stands heroic, striking his signature
          "thumbs up" stance.

                              MUNTZ
                    "Adventure is out there!"

          In the theater, Young Carl returns the thumbs up.

                               NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    But what has Muntz brought back
                    this time?

          
          Muntz speaks to a crowded auditorium, on stage beside a
          curtained object.

                              MUNTZ
                    Gentlemen, I give you: the Monster
                    of Paradise Falls!

          He pulls away the drape to reveal a GIANT BIRD SKELETON.

          

                              CROWD
                    Ooh!
          Young Carl leans forward, eyes bulging.

          

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    And golly, what a swell monster
                    this is. But what's this?

          Skeptical scientists analyze the bones.

          

                                                                        3.

          

          

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    Scientists cry foul! The National
                    Explorers Society accuses Muntz of
                    fabricating the skeleton!

          

                                 YOUNG CARL
                    No!

          
          Muntz's portrait is removed from a wall of paintings of other
          famous explorers.

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    The organization strips Muntz of
                    his membership.

          
          Muntz's "Explorer's Society" badge is ceremoniously RIPPED
          from his jacket.
          Carl GASPS.

          
          Muntz stands next to his dirigible at an airfield.       He grimly
          addresses the crowd.

          

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    Humiliated, Muntz vows a return to
                    Paradise Falls and promises to
                    capture the beast... alive!

          

                              MUNTZ
                    I promise to capture the beast...
                    alive!

          
          In the theater, young Carl smiles.

                              MUNTZ
                    And I will not come back until I do!
          The crowd CHEERS.

          
          Muntz gives his thumbs up from the cockpit as the dirigible
          lifts off.

                                 NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    And so the    explorer is off to clear
                    his name.     Bon voyage Charles
                    Muntz, and    good luck capturing the
                    Monster of    Paradise Falls!
          Carl looks like he just witnessed a miracle.

          

                                                             DISSOLVE TO:

          

                                                                    4.

          

          

          

          EXT. SMALL TOWN NEIGHBORHOOD, 1930'S - DAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          Young Carl "flies" his blue balloon ("The Spirit of
          Adventure" hand-written on it) as he runs along the sidewalk.
          He still wears helmet and goggles.

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    He... goes around Mount Everest!
                    Is there nothing he cannot do?

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    Yes, as Muntz himself says:
                    "Adventure is--"

          

                              GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    "Adventure is out there!"
          Carl stops.   Who said that?

          
          The voice comes from a dilapidated HOUSE, windows boarded up
          and lawn overgrown with weeds.
          The weather vane atop the house turns, pulled by ropes.

          

                              GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Look out! Mount Rushmore! Hard to
                    starboard. Must get the Spirit of
                    Adventure over Mount Rushmore...

          

                                                                       5.

          

          
          Carl walks toward the voice.

          

                              GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hold together old girl. How're my
                    dogs doing? Ruff ruff!

          

          INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          Carl squeezes through the broken door into the foyer.   He
          follows the voice toward the living room.

          

                              GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    All engines ahead full! Let's take
                    her up to 26,000 feet! Rudders
                    eighteen degrees towards the south.

          

          INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS


          
          Carl rounds the corner to see...

          
          ELLIE, an eight year old girl, her mussy red hair barely
          visible beneath her flight helmet and goggles. Bare footed,
          her overalls are patched and dirty.
          The old house has been transformed into a make-believe
          dirigible cockpit. Ellie steers, the wheel made from a rusty
          old bicycle.

          

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    It's a beautiful day, winds out of
                    the east at ten knots.
                    Visibility... unlimited.
                        (yells a command)
                    Enter the weather in the logbook!
          The navigator (her hamster) skitters in its cage.

          
          Ellie uses two tied-together Coke bottles as binoculars.

          

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    Oh! There's something down there!
                    I will bring it back for science.
                    Awwww, it's a puppy!

          
          Carl is distracted by the Muntz newspaper clippings taped to
          the wall.

          

                               YOUNG ELLIE (O.S.)
                    No time!   A storm! Lightning! Hail!
          Ellie pops up in front of Carl.

          

                                                                    6.

          

          

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    What are you doing!?!

          
          Carl screams. He lets go of his balloon. It floats through
          a broken part of the ceiling and disappears.
          Ellie circles Carl accusingly.

          

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    Don't you know this is an exclusive
                    club? Only explorers get in here.
                    Not just any kid off the street
                    with a helmet and a pair of
                    goggles. Do you think you got what
                    it takes? Well, do you?!?

          
          Carl FUMPHERS.

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    Alright, you're in. Welcome aboard.
          She offers her hand.   Carl looks down, embarrassed.

          

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    What's wrong? Can't you talk?
          Carl is frozen.   Ellie softens.

          

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    Hey, I don't bite.
          She takes off her helmet.   Her hair frizzes out in all
          directions.
          She removes a homemade GRAPE SODA CAP pin from her shirt and
          pins it on Carl.

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    You and me, we're in a club now.

          
          Carl smiles.

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    I saw where your balloon went.
                    Come on, let's go get it!

          
          Carl watches her stride out of the room.   She pops back in.

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    My name's Ellie.

          
          She grabs his hand.
          Carl blushes as she pulls him out of the room.

          

                                                                     7.

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       There it is.

          
          Carl and Ellie look across the attic at the balloon. Between
          them the floor has collapsed, save one rickety beam. Carl GULPS.

          

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       Well, go ahead.
          She pushes him out onto the beam.

                                    YOUNG ELLIE
                       Go on.

          
          Carl steels his courage. He puts on his goggles, starts
          forward... and FALLS through the floor.

                                                            CUT TO:

          Carl in bed, reading a book by flashlight, his arm in a CAST.

          
          Into the room floats Carl's lost BLUE BALLOON.
          Carl jumps and CALLS OUT in fright.

          

                                    YOUNG CARL
                              (re: arm)
                       Ow!

          
          A head pops up from outside the open window.

          

                                    YOUNG ELLIE
                       Hey kid!!

          
          Carl SCREAMS, hitting himself in the face with the cast.

          

                                    YOUNG CARL
                       Ow!!

          

                                                                    8.

          

          
          Ellie climbs in the window.

          

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       Thought you might need a little
                       cheerin' up. I got somethin' to
                       show ya!

          

          INT. CARL'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER


          
          The two hunker under a blanket tent with a flashlight.   Ellie
          whispers, as if to protect a National Secret.

          

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       I am about to let you see something
                       I have never shown to another human
                       being. Ever. In my life.
          Carl's eyes widen in alarm.

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       You'll have to swear you will not
                       tell anyone.
          Carl nods.

          

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       Cross your heart. Do it!
          Carl crosses.    Ellie unveils...

          

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       My Adventure Book!
          It's a reused photo album with the words "My Adventure Book"
          written across it. She opens it to a photo of Charles Muntz.

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       You know him.
          Carl smiles excitedly.

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       Charles Muntz, explorer. When I get
                       big, I'm going where he's going:
                       South America.
          She turns the page to a map.

          

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       It's like America... but south.
                       Wanna know where I'm gonna live?

          

                                                                   9.

          

          
          She turns to an engraving of a large waterfall. A small hand-
          drawn picture of Ellie's clubhouse is glued to the top.

          

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                           (reading caption)
                       "Paradise Falls, a land lost in
                       time." I ripped this right out of
                       a library book.

          
          Carl GASPS in horror.

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       I'm gonna move my clubhouse there,
                       and park it right next to the
                       falls. Who knows what lives up
                       there? And once I get there...

          
          She flips through her book, revealing a page marked, "STUFF
          I'M GOING TO DO." Past that, the pages are blank.

          

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       Well, I'm saving these pages for
                       all the adventures I'm gonna have.
                       Only... I just don't know how I'm
                       gonna get to Paradise Falls.
          Ellie closes the book, disappointed.

          
          Carl has a thought.    He looks at his toy dirigible.

          

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       That's it! You can take us there
                       in a blimp! Swear you'll take us.
                       Cross your heart! Cross it! Cross
                       your heart.

          
          Carl does.

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       Good. You promised. No backing out.

          
          Carl shakes his head "no."

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       Well, see you tomorrow kid!   Bye.

          
          Ellie hops up and jumps out the window.

                                YOUNG ELLIE
                       "Adventure is out there!!"

          
          She pops back in.

          

                                                                    10.

          

          

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    You know, you don't talk very much.
                    I like you.

          
          Carl looks out the window after her in amazement.   He rests
          his head on his balloon.

          

                              YOUNG CARL
                    Wow.

          
          The balloon pops.

          

                                                              CUT TO:

          

          INT. CHURCH - DAY


          
          FLASH! A photo is taken of the wedding couple: Carl and
          Ellie, now 19. She jumps at him and gives him a big kiss.

          
          Ellie's side of the church erupts like wild frontiersmen.     A
          gun shot is fired in the air.

          
          Carl's side, rigid puritans in black, clap politely.

          

          EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY


          
          Carl carries her past a "SOLD" sign.   It's the same house
          where they met as kids.

          

          

          EXT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE - DAY

          Still in their wedding clothes: She saws as he hammers.

          

          INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY


          
          They push two chairs into place side by side in the living room.

          

          EXT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE - DAY


          
          Ellie finishes painting "Carl & Ellie" on their MAILBOX.
          Carl leans in to admire her work but leaves a messy paint
          handprint on the mailbox! Oh well; Ellie adds her handprint
          as well. They smile.

          

          

          EXT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE - DAY

          Their house now matches Ellie's colorful CLUB HOUSE DRAWING
          from her childhood Adventure Book.

          

                                                                   11.

          

          

          

          EXT. RURAL HILLSIDE - DAY


          
          They run up a hillside together.

          
          They lie side by side on a picnic blanket. She describes the
          clouds. He watches as a cloud transforms into a turtle.

          
          Carl closes his eyes and smiles.   He's lucky to be with her.

          

          EXT. ZOO - DAY


          
          Ellie emerges from the South America House, dressed in her
          Zookeeper's uniform.

          
          Carl shows off his new BALLOON CART and uniform. Behind him
          the balloons lift his cart off the ground. Carl jumps to
          catch it. She giggles.

          

          INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY


          
          Carl and Ellie sit side by side in their chairs, reading.
          Without looking up from their books, they hold hands.

          

          EXT. RURAL HILLSIDE - DAY


          
          Again at their picnic spot, they watch clouds. Ellie sees an
          elephant with wings. Carl gives it a try and points out a
          BABY. Ellie lights up, excited. She sees ALL the clouds as
          babies! Carl is stunned... but smiles.

          

          

          INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, BABY ROOM - DAY


          
          Ellie finishes painting a wall mural of a stork carrying a
          bundle in its beak. Carl hangs a mobile above the crib.

          

          

          INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

          Carl touches Ellie's shoulder as the doctor explains.   Ellie
          drops her head in her hands.

          

          

          EXT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

          Carl looks out the window.   Ellie sits alone under a tree,
          the wind in her hair.

          

                                                                    12.

          

          

          

          EXT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, YARD - AFTERNOON


          
          Carl joins Ellie.   He hands her the Adventure Book. She smiles.

          

          INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON


          
          Ellie paints a MURAL of their house atop Paradise Falls over
          the mantle. Carl organizes a compass, map, binoculars, and
          native bird figurine beneath the painting. It's their shrine
          to Adventure.

          

          INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON


          
          Carl sets A JAR on a table, "PARADISE FALLS" written on it.
          Ellie drops in a few coins. She looks at Carl and crosses
          her heart. Carl crosses his.

          

          A SERIES OF SHOTS

          
          The jar slowly fills as Carl and Ellie toss in spare change.
          Their car blows a tire.
          The two stand by the jar, reluctant.   Carl BREAKS the jar.

          
          New tire.

          
          Carl in the hospital with a broken leg.

          
          Breaking jar.
          A storm rages.   A tree falls, crushing the roof.

          
          Breaking jar.

          

          INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - MORNING


          
          Carl struggles to tie his tie.   Ellie helps.   They walk out
          the front door arm in arm.

          

          

          INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - 3 YEARS LATER

          Ellie struggles to tie Carl's tie as they rush out the door.

          
          A SERIES OF SHOTS as Ellie straightens Carl's ties.    Stylish
          1950's ties. Wide 60's ties. Paisley 70's ties.

          

                                                                      13.

          

          

          

          INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - 30 YEARS LATER


          
          Older Carl and Ellie smile at themselves in the hall mirror.

          

          EXT. ZOO - DAY


          
          Carl in his 60's. They still work happily side by side at
          the zoo. Carl's cart lifts off the ground. He casually
          leans an elbow on it.

          

          INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Carl and Ellie dance in the evening candlelight. The
          PARADISE FALLS JAR sits off to the side, now dusty and
          forgotten.

          

          INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM WINDOW - AFTERNOON

          Carl cleans the inside of the window.    Ellie cleans the
          outside.

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON


          
          Carl vacuums the Adventure Shrine on the mantle. Carl smiles
          at a photo of Ellie as a child, wearing her flight helmet and
          goggles. He looks up at the mural of their house at Paradise
          Falls. His smile fades.

          
          Behind him, Ellie sweeps the floor.    Their dream has gone
          unfulfilled.

          
          Carl has an idea.

          

          EXT. TRAVEL AGENCY - DAY


          
          Carl buys two tickets to South America.

          

          EXT. RURAL HILLSIDE - AFTERNOON


          
          Carl hurries excitedly up picnic hill.    He hides the airline
          tickets in his basket.
          Behind him, Ellie falters and falls.    She tries to get up but
          falls again. Something is wrong.

          
          He runs to her.

          

                                                                    14.

          

          

          

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY


          
          Ellie lies in a hospital bed.    She looks through her

          ADVENTURE BOOK.

          
          A BLUE BALLOON floats in to the room.

          
          Carl stands at the door.   He smiles and walks to her bedside.

          
          Ellie pushes her Adventure Book toward him.    She weakly pats
          his cheek and adjusts his tie.

          
          He kisses her on the forehead.

          

          INT. CHURCH - AFTERNOON


          
          Carl sits alone, next to a huge bouquet of balloons.

          

          EXT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE - DUSK


          
          Carl walks into the house, holding a single blue balloon.

                                                        FADE TO BLACK.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S BEDROOM - MORNING - SEVERAL YEARS LATER

          An ALARM CLOCK BUZZES.    An aged hand shuts it off and picks
          up the nearby glasses.

          
          CARL sits alone in his double bed.   He rubs his face. GRUNTS.
          He gets out of bed, STRETCHING, GRUNTING and CRACKING BONES.

          
          He grabs his cane, with four tennis balls stuck to the bottom
          spokes.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S STAIRCASE - LATER

          Now dressed, Carl rides his ELDERLY ASSISTANCE CHAIR down the
          staircase. This takes a LONG, LONG time.

          
          Three quarters of the way down, the chair stops.    He bangs
          the armrest and the chair restarts.

          

          INT. CARL'S KITCHEN - LATER


          
          Carl eats breakfast by himself.

          

                                                                      15.

          

          

          

          INT. CARL'S LIVING ROOM WINDOW - LATER


          
          Carl cleans the window with a cloth.    His lonely reflection
          stares back at him.

          

          INT. CARL'S LIVING ROOM - LATER


          
          Carl dusts the mantle and Shrine to Adventure.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - LATER

          Carl looks in the hall mirror. He puts on his hat and
          considers his reflection. He straightens his GRAPE SODA PIN.

          

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - CONTINUOUS

          Many LOCKS are heard unlocking from inside.
          The door opens, but bangs against the safety chain.      Carl
          GRUMBLES in frustration.
          Carl opens the door, walks out onto his porch, pulls the door
          shut, and looks as if he's about to go somewhere.

          
          He sits in his porch chair.

          

          EXT. CARL'S NEIGHBORHOOD - CONTINUOUS


          
          Carl's house is the lone surviving square on the block not
          under construction. Machinery and workers circle busily.
          High rise buildings are being erected all around.

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - MORNING


          
          Carl looks at the activity around him.

          

                              CARL
                    Quite a sight, huh Ellie?
                        (noticing mailbox)
                    Uhp, mail's here.

          
          Carl walks to the mailbox.    He touches Ellie's faded
          HANDPRINT and smiles.

          
          He looks through the mail.

          
          He sees a SHADY OAKS RETIREMENT VILLAGE pamphlet full of
          images of happy old people. Carl scoffs.

          

                                                                   16.

          

          

                              CARL
                    Shady Oaks Retirement.    Oh brother.

          
          Carl notices DUST on his mailbox.

          

                              CARL
                    Hm.

          
          He pulls up a LEAF BLOWER.   He revs it and blasts off the dust.

          
          TOM, the CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN, notices.

          

                              CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
                    Hey! `Morning, Mr. Fredricksen!
                    Need any help there?

          

                              CARL
                    No. Yes. Tell your boss over there
                    that you boys are ruining our house.

          
          He points across the lot to a business man in a suit talking
          on a cell phone - the REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER.

          

                              CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
                    Well just to let you know, my boss
                    would be happy to take this old
                    place off your hands, and for
                    double his last offer. Whaddya say
                    to that?
          The leaf blower blasts off his hat.

          

                              CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
                    Uh, I take that as a no, then.

                              CARL
                    I believe I made my position to
                    your boss quite clear.

                              CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
                    You poured prune juice in his gas tank.

          

                              CARL
                    Oh yeah, that was good. Here, let
                    me talk to him.

          
          Tom hands Carl his MEGAPHONE.

          

                              CARL
                        (in megaphone)
                    You in the suit. Yes, you.      Take a
                    bath, hippy!

          
          Tom grabs the megaphone.

          

                                                                  17.

          

          

                              CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
                        (to Boss, re Carl)
                    I am not with him!
                        (to Carl)
                    This is serious. He's out to get
                    your house!

          
          Carl walks to his front door.

          

                              CARL
                    Tell your boss he can have our house.

          

                                 CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
                    Really?

          

                              CARL
                    When I'm dead!
          Carl SLAMS the door.

                              CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
                    I'll take that as a maybe!

          

          INT. CARL'S LIVING ROOM - DAY - LATER


          
          Carl sits in his chair watching TV.

          
          A KNOCK at the door.

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - DAY


          
          The door opens.
          A Wilderness Explorer stands, reading from a Wilderness
          Explorer Manual. He is in uniform, complete with sash,
          neckerchief, hat, and an enormous backpack stuffed with every
          piece of equipment there is. This is RUSSELL, age 8.
          Russell, nose buried in his MANUAL, reads to Carl.

                              RUSSELL
                    "Good afternoon. My name is
                    Russell. And I am a Wilderness
                    Explorer in Tribe 54, Sweatlodge
                    12. Are you in need of any
                    assistance today, sir?"

          
          As he finishes the script, Russell smiles up at Carl.

          

                                 CARL
                    No.

          

                                                                   18.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    I could help you cross the street.

          

                               CARL
                    No.

                              RUSSELL
                    I could help you cross your yard.

          

                               CARL
                    No.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    I could help you cross your... porch?

          

                               CARL
                    No.

                               RUSSELL
                    Well, I gotta help you cross
                    something.

          

                               CARL
                    Uh, no.   I'm doing fine.

          
          Carl closes the door in Russell's face.

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - CONTINUOUS


          
          Carl listens through the door. Is the kid gone?   He opens it.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    "Good afternoon. My name is
                    Russell."

          

                              CARL
                    Uh... kid...

          

                              RUSSELL
                    "And I am a Wilderness Explorer in
                    Tribe 54, Sweatlodge 12."

                               CARL
                    Kid.   KID!!

          
          Russell stops... but goes back to reading.

                              RUSSELL
                    "Are you in need of any assistance
                    today Sir?"

                              CARL
                    Thank you, but I don't need any help!

          

                                                                     19.

          

          
          Carl swings the door shut, but a small camping boot stops it.

          

                                 RUSSELL
                    Ow.

          
          Carl opens the door.    Russell stands at attention.

          

                              CARL

                        (RESIGNED)
                    Proceed.

                              RUSSELL
                    "Good afternoon. My-"

                              CARL
                    But skip to the end!

          
          Russell points to his SASH. It is covered with badges except
          for one glaringly empty space.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    See these? These are my Wilderness
                    Explorer badges. You may notice
                    one is missing. It's my Assisting
                    the Elderly badge. If I get it I
                    will become a Senior Wilderness
                    Explorer!
          Russell makes the Explorer Sign: his thumbs form a "W", his
          fingers the "wings" of a bird, then the "claws" of a bear.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    "The wilderness must be explored!

                    CAW-CAW! RAAAR!"

          
          This sets Carl's hearing aid off. Carl GRUMBLES in pain.

                              RUSSELL
                    It's gonna be great! There's a big
                    ceremony, and all the dads come,
                    and they pin on our badges...

                              CARL
                    So you want to assist an old
                    person?

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Yep! Then I will be a Senior
                    Wilderness Explorer!
          Carl leans in close to Russell.

          

                                                                  20.

          

          

                              CARL

                        (CONSPIRATORIALLY)
                    You ever heard of a snipe?

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Snipe?

          

                              CARL
                    Bird. Beady eyes. Every night it
                    sneaks in my yard and gobbles my
                    poor azaleas. I'm elderly and
                    infirm. I can't catch it. If only
                    someone could help me...

                               RUSSELL
                    Me! Me!   I'll do it!

          

                              CARL
                    Oh, I don't know, it's awfully
                    crafty. You'd have to clap your
                    hands three times to lure it in.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    I'll find it, Mr. Fredricksen!

          

                              CARL
                    I think its burrow is two blocks
                    down. If you go past --

                              RUSSELL
                    Two blocks down! Got it!

          
          Russell runs down the block clapping and calling.

                              RUSSELL
                    Sniiiipe! Here Snipey Snipey...

                              CARL
                        (calls after Russell)
                    Bring it back here when you find
                    it!
          Carl rolls his eyes and begins to close his door.

          
          He stops short.

          
          A large truck is backing up, getting dangerously close to

          ELLIE'S MAILBOX.

          

                              CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE
                    Okay, keep her coming... And...
                    stop. Stop! STOP!!
          The truck hits Ellie's mailbox, crushing the front.

          

                                                                      21.

          

          
          Carl is shocked.   He runs to the box.

          

                              CARL
                    What? Hey! Hey you!         What do you
                    think you're doing?

                              CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE
                    I am so sorry, sir...

          
          The worker bangs on the mailbox, trying to fix it.

                              CARL
                    Don't touch that!

                              CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE
                    No no, let me take care of that for you.

          
          Carl grabs the mailbox, trying to wrestle it from the worker.

                              CARL

                        (STRUGGLING)
                    Get away from our mailbox!

          

                              CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE
                    Hey sir, I...

                              CARL
                    I don't want you to touch it!
          Carl HITS the worker with his cane.      He falls to the sidewalk.
          The worker rubs his head.    Blood.

          
          Carl backs up toward his door, cradling his mailbox.     What
          has he done?

          
          Passerbys stare.
          Workers gather, as does the REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER.

          
          Carl backs into his house.

          

          INT. CARL'S LIVING ROOM


          
          Carl shuts his door.   He closes the curtains.
          He peeks out the window. The injured worker is helped to his
          feet. A police car pulls up.

          
          The Real Estate Developer looks toward Carl's house.     His
          hand rests on Carl's fence.

          

                                                                     22.

          

          

          

          INT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - DAY


          
          Carl sits alone on a bench holding a Court Summons.

          

          INT. COURTROOM - DAY


          
          A GUARD opens the door. Carl enters.    The REAL ESTATE
          DEVELOPER watches him enter.

          

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE - LATE EVENING

          A Police Officer drops Carl at his front gate.

          

                               OFFICER EDITH
                    Sorry Mr. Fredricksen. You don't
                    seem like a public menace to me.
                    Take this.

          
          She hands him a pamphlet for SHADY OAKS RETIREMENT VILLAGE.

          

                              OFFICER EDITH
                    The guys from Shady Oaks will be by
                    to pick you up in the morning, okay?
          The officer drives off, leaving Carl alone.

          
          Carl faces the house.    He touches Ellie's dented mailbox.

          

                              CARL
                    What do I do now, Ellie?

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - NIGHT


          
          All is quiet but the slow ticking of the clock.
          The empty hall.

          
          The front hall mirror.
          The kitchen.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, CLOSET

          Carl pulls out a suitcase.   A book tips over.   Ellie's
          Adventure Book.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM

          Carl sits in his chair slowly paging through the book.

          

                                                                       23.

          

          
          He turns to the page marked "STUFF I'M GOING TO DO."    He
          closes the book and sighs.

          
          Carl looks at the Adventure Shrine, and the PAINTING of their
          house by Paradise Falls.
          He holds the Shady Oaks pamphlet.

          
          Carl's brows furrow.    He looks up at the shrine, and crosses
          his heart.

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Lights are on inside the house.

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE - MORNING


          
          A SHADY OAKS RETIREMENT VILLAGE van pulls up.
          Nurses GEORGE and A.J. walk to Carl's door and KNOCK.
          Carl answers, holding a suitcase.

          

                              CARL
                    Morning gentlemen.

                              NURSE GEORGE
                    Good morning, Mr. Fredricksen.    You
                    ready to go?

          

                               CARL
                    Ready as I'll ever be. Would you
                    do me a favor and take this?

          
          Carl hands over his suitcase.

          

                              CARL
                    I'll meet you at the van in just a
                    minute. I... want to say one last
                    goodbye to the old place.

          

                               NURSE GEORGE
                    Sure.   Take all the time you need, sir.

          
          Carl closes the door.   Rather sharply.   The nurses head back
          to the van.

          

                                                                     24.

          

          

                                NURSE A.J.
                      Typical. He's probably going to the
                      bathroom for the eightieth time.

          
          Empty helium tanks are strewn on the front lawn.

                                 NURSE GEORGE
                      You'd think he'd take better care
                      of his house.

          
          A SHADOW falls over the nurses.   They turn to look.

          
          A giant tarp rises behind Carl's house.     It unfolds to reveal

          THOUSANDS OF BALLOONS.

          
          The balloons rise up like some massive multi-colored cumulus
          cloud forming a thunderhead above the house.
          Strings tug at the chimney. The house strains.     Pipes bend,
          then break. Electrical wires spark and snap.
          The house rips away from its foundation.

          
          The nurses duck and YELL as the house soars over them.    Carl
          looks out the window and LAUGHS.

                                CARL
                      So long boys! I'll send you a
                      postcard from Paradise Falls!

          

          INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS


          
          Balloons spill colored light into a little girl's room as the
          house floats past.

          

          EXT. TOWN


          
          The shadow of the house drifts through an intersection.

          

          EXT. SHOP WINDOW


          
          A family watches the house float down the street.

          

          EXT. ABOVE THE TOWN


          
          Carl waves at a high-rise window washer, who tentatively
          waves back.
          The house crests the top of a building, drifting over and away
          from the city. Carl looks out his window. Good riddance.

          

                                                                   25.

          Carl sets a compass next to the map of South America.

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, BEDROOM WINDOW


          
          Sails made from stitched-together curtains emerge from the
          windows and billow in the wind. Carl steers using ropes
          attached to the weather vane.

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM

          The compass needle rotates to point SOUTH.

          

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE

          The house turns.
          Carl looks out the window, satisfied.   He checks the balloons.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM

          Carl kisses a photo of Ellie.

          

                              CARL
                    We're on our way, Ellie.
          Carl kneels at the fireplace and plunks the balloon strings
          tied to the grate.
          He CHUCKLES and settles into his chair.   He closes his eyes
          and smiles.
          SHADOWS move gently across the fireplace mantle.

          

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING

          The house drifts through the clouds.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM

          Carl relaxes in his chair.

          

          KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.

          

                               CARL
                    Huh?

          

                                                                      26.

          

          
          He stares at the front door.   Nothing.

          

                               CARL
                    Hm.

          

          KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.

          
          He bolts up and approaches the door. He looks out the peep
          hole. Nothing but the porch and clouds. He throws it open.

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - DAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          Nothing. He looks left.     Nothing.   He looks right.   Russell.
          He looks... Russell?!!

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Hi, Mr. Fredricksen.    It's me,
                    Russell.

          

                              CARL
                    What are you doing out here, kid?

          
          Russell is plastered up against the wall, terrified and
          holding on for dear life.

                              RUSSELL
                    I found the snipe and I followed it
                    under your porch, but this snipe
                    had a long tail and looked more
                    like a large mouse.

          
          The flag on Russell's backpack blows off and falls through
          the clouds.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Please let me in?

                               CARL
                    No.

          
          Carl slams the door, leaving Russell alone.
          Beat. The door opens again.

          

                              CARL
                    Oh, alright, you can come...
          Russell runs into the house past Carl.

          

                               CARL
                    ...in.

          

                                                                   27.

          

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          Russell PANTS, panicked.   He looks into living room.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Huh. I've never been in a floating
                    house before.

          
          Carl follows Russell into the living room.   Russell chuckles
          and points at the photo of young Ellie.

                               RUSSELL
                    Goggles.   Look at this stuff!
          Russell finds Ellie's house drawing sitting on the pages of
          the open atlas.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Wow, you going on a trip?
                        (reads from the engraving)
                    "Paradise Falls: A Land Lost in
                    Time." You going to South America,
                    Mr. Fredricksen?
          Carl takes the page and puts it in his pocket.

                              CARL
                    Don't touch that.   You'll soil it.

                              RUSSELL
                    You know, most people take a plane,
                    but you're smart because you'll have
                    all your TV and clocks and stuff.
          Russell runs over to the steering rig.

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Whoah.   Is this how you steer your
                    house?   Does it really work?

          

                              CARL
                    Kid, would you stop with the --
          Russell steers and the house tilts, knocking Carl back and
          forth.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Oh, this makes it go right, and
                    that way's left.

          

                              CARL
                    Let go of the -- knock it off!
          Russell looks out the window in front of him.

          

                                                                    28.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Hey look, buildings!

          

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

          Russell and Carl arrive at the window.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    That building's so close I could
                    almost touch it.

          
          That gives Carl an idea.

                                                              CUT TO:

          
          Carl lowers Russell on a rope below the floating house.

                              RUSSELL
                    Wow! This is great! You should try
                    this, Mr. Fredricksen! Look, there's
                    a bus that could take me home two
                    blocks away!
                        (looking up)
                    Hey, I can see your house from here!

                              CARL
                        (struggling to hold on)
                    Don't jerk around so much, kid!

          
          The rope slips through Carl's hands.   Russell FALLS.

          

                                                              CUT TO:
          Carl stands beside Russell at the window.    Russell's fall had
          been a daydream.

                              CARL
                    Well, that's not gonna work.

          
          Carl leaves Russell at the window.

                              RUSSELL
                    I know that cloud, it's a Cumulo
                    Nimbus. Did you know that the
                    Cumulo Nimbus...

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          GRUMBLING, Carl kneels at the fireplace to cut a few balloon
          strings with his housekeys.

          

                                                                     29.

                    Stayed up all night blowing up
                    balloons, for what?

          

                              RUSSELL
                    ...warm air goes by cool air, and
                    the airs go by each other and
                    that's how we get lightning.

          

                              CARL
                    That's nice, kid.

          
          Carl turns off his hearing aid.    Silence.   He smiles.
          Russell tries to get Carl's attention.   A storm is brewing in
          the distance.

          

                              RUSSELL
                        (nearly silent)
                    Mr. Fredricksen, there's a big
                    storm coming. It's starting to get
                    scary. We're gonna get blown to
                    bits! We're in big trouble, Mr.
                    Fredricksen!

          
          A huge lightning bolt flash lights up the room.    Carl turns
          on his hearing aid.

          

                              CARL
                    What are you doing over there?

                                RUSSELL

                    See?    Cumulo Nimbus.

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS


          
          The tiny house is heading for a MASSIVE STORM.
          Carl STRUGGLES to steer the house away but is blown into the
          storm. The steering mechanism recoils and sends Carl flying.

          
          Plates fall from the walls and furniture slides as the house
          is rocked in the storm.
          Russell's backpack slides toward the front door.

          

                                                                       30.

          

          

                                RUSSELL
                    My pack!

          
          Russell HOPS on top of the backpack.

          

                                RUSSELL
                    Got ya!

          
          The pack slides toward the OPEN FRONT DOOR. Russell screams.
          He's about to slide out when the house tilts and the door
          swings shut.

          
          The Paradise Falls jar rolls past Carl.     He chases after it.
          Ellie's chair slides across the room.      Carl gasps and runs to
          protect it.

          
          The photo of Ellie rocks and slides off the wall.     Carl
          lunges to catch it.

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING


          
          The storm rages.    The house is tossed into the storm clouds.
          All goes black.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MORNING

          Carl is asleep.
          A finger pokes Carl's face.     Nothing.

          
          The finger pokes Carl's face again.    Carl WAKES UP.

          

                                RUSSELL
                    Whew!    I thought you were dead.

                              CARL
                    Wha... what happened?

          
          Carl STRUGGLES to rise from the pile of Ellie's things he'd
          been protecting.

          

                               RUSSELL
                    I steered us. I did!      I steered
                    the house!

                              CARL
                    Steered us?

          

                                                                  31.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    After you tied your stuff down you
                    took a nap, so I went ahead and
                    steered us down here.

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, WINDOW


          
          Carl opens the window and looks out.

          

                               CARL
                    Huh?

          

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING


          
          The house floats motionless above an ocean of clouds.

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, WINDOW


                              CARL
                    Can't tell where we are.

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM


          

                              RUSSELL
                    Oh we're in South America all
                    right. It was a cinch, with my
                    Wilderness Explorer GPS.

          
          Russell holds up his WILDERNESS EXPLORER GPS UNIT.

                               CARL
                    GP-what?

                              RUSSELL
                    My dad gave it to me. It shows
                    exactly where we are on the planet.
                    With this baby, we'll never be lost!
          Russell gestures, tossing the unit out the window.

          

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING

          Carl and Russell watch the tiny GPS unit descend into the
          clouds.

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Oops.

          

                                                                   32.

          

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM


          
          Carl kneels by the fireplace and cuts at the balloon strings.

          

                              CARL
                    We'll get you down, find a bus
                    stop. You just tell the man you
                    want to go back to your mother.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Sure, but I don't think they have
                    busses in Paradise Falls.

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING


          
          A small cluster of balloons fly up and away from the house.

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM


                              CARL
                    There. That ought to do it. Here,
                    I'll give you some change for bus fare.

          
          Russell follows Carl toward the front door.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Nah, I'll just use my city bus pass.

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING


          
          The house lowers into the fog.

          

                              RUSSELL (O.S.)
                    Whoah, that's gonna be like a
                    billion transfers to get back to my
                    house.

          

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH

          Carl and Russell stand on the porch as the house moves down
          into and through the thick, dark clouds.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Mr. Fredricksen, how much longer?

          

                              CARL
                    Well, we're up pretty high.   Could
                    take hours to get down.
          Something flashes by them in the fog.   Carl leans forward.

          

                                                                    33.

          

          

                                CARL

                         (MUMBLING)
                     ...that thing was...building or
                     something.

          
          Another dark object whooshes past them.   Carl ducks.

          

                               RUSSELL
                     What was that, Mr. Fredricksen?

          

                               CARL
                     We can't be close to the ground yet.

          
          A brief view of rocks directly below them.

          
          Carl GASPS.

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, ROCKY LANDSCAPE


          
          BAM!!!   The house CRASHES into the ground.

          
          Russell and Carl fly off the porch and onto the ground.   They
          land hard.

          
          Carl's house is floating away!

          
          Carl runs after the GARDEN HOSE dragging across the ground.

                               CARL
                     Wait, wait! No don't, don't, don't!

          
          Carl grabs the hose and is PULLED UP in the air.

                                CARL
                     Whoah!   Hey, hey!
          Russell JUMPS onto Carl's leg and the extra weight pulls them
          to the ground.

          

                               CARL
                     Russell, hang on!
          Carl and Russell slide toward the edge of a CLIFF EDGE.

          

                                  RUSSELL
                     Whoah!
          They slide toward the edge... and stop.   The drop is
          thousands of feet. Carl is TERRIFIED.

          

                                  CARL
                     Walk back!     Walk back!

          

                                                                    34.

          

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Okay!

          
          Russell PULLS Carl by the leg away from the cliff edge.
          Carl, still hanging from the hose, looks around.
          Fog blankets the mysterious landscape, revealing only
          scattered rocks.

          

                              CARL
                        (out of breath)
                    Where... where are we?

          

                              RUSSELL
                    This doesn't look like the city or
                    the jungle, Mr. Fredricksen.
          The wind picks up and they STRUGGLE against it.

          

                              CARL
                        (to house)
                    Don't worry, Ellie. I got it.
          The wind clears the fog, slowly revealing a crescent shaped,
          flat-topped mountain on which they stand.

          
          Across it, some ten miles away, is PARADISE FALLS.
          Carl stares.   He can't believe it.

          

                               CARL
                    There it is. Ellie, it's so
                    beautiful.

          
          The landscape is stunning.

          
          Carl shows Russell the engraving with the Ellie drawing of
          the house atop the falls.

          

                              CARL
                    We made it. We made it! Russell,
                    we could float right over there.
                    Climb up. Climb up!

          

                              RUSSELL
                    You mean assist you?

          

                              CARL
                    Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Okay, I'll climb up!

          
          Russell CLIMBS Carl, stepping on his leg, arms, and face.

          

                                                                  35.

          

          

                                 CARL
                    Watch it.

          

                                 RUSSELL
                    Sorry.
          The hose jiggles as Russell CLIMBS out of frame.

          

                              CARL
                    Now, when you get up there, go
                    ahead and hoist me up! Got it?!

          
          Russell continues to grunt and strain off screen.

                              CARL
                    You on the porch yet?!

          
          Russell is just inches above Carl, still STRUGGLING to climb.
          He slides down onto Carl's head, exhausted.

          

                              CARL
                    What? That's it?! I came all this
                    way just to get stuck at the wrong
                    end of this rock pile? Aw, great!

          
          Carl paces.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Hey, if I could assist you over
                    there, would you sign off on my
                    badge?

          

                              CARL
                    What are you talking about?

          

                              RUSSELL
                    We could walk your house to the
                    falls!

          

                                 CARL
                    Walk it?

                              RUSSELL
                    Yeah, after all, we weigh it down.
                    We could walk it right over there.
                    Like a parade balloon.
          Carl considers this.

          

                                                                    36.

          

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, ROCKY LANDSCAPE, DAY - LATER


          
          The house floats against the sky. The hose descends from the
          house and "Y"s to tie to both Carl and Russell. They wear
          the hose like a harness, pulling the house as they walk.

                              CARL
                    Now, we're gonna walk to the falls
                    quickly and quietly, with no rap
                    music or flash-dancing.
          Russell inspects his surroundings.

                              RUSSELL

                        (DISTRACTED)
                    Uh-huh.

          

                              CARL
                    We have three days, at best, before
                    the helium leaks out of those
                    balloons. And if we're not at the
                    falls when that happens...

          

                                 RUSSELL
                    Sand!

                              CARL
                    ...we're not getting to the falls!

                              RUSSELL
                    I found sand!

          
          Carl ROLLS HIS EYES.    He looks up at the house.

                              CARL
                    Don't you worry, Ellie.    We'll get
                    our house over there.
          Russell looks up at the house.   Who's Carl talking to?

          

                                 RUSSELL
                    Huh.
                        (shrugs it off)
                    This is fun already, isn't it? By
                    the time we get there, you're gonna
                    feel so assisted... Oh, Mr.
                    Fredricksen, if we happen to get
                    separated, use the Wilderness
                    Explorer call. Caw caw, raaar!!

          
          The WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL sets off Carl's hearing aid.

          

                                                                      37.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Wait. Why are we going to Paradise
                    Falls again?

          

                              CARL
                    Hey, let's play a game. It's
                    called: "See who can be quiet the
                    longest."

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Cool!   My mom loves that game!

          
          They head toward Paradise Falls, some 10 miles away.

                                                         DISSOLVE TO:

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY

          Mist hangs ominously over a rocky landscape.
          Something tall blasts through a maze of rocks.

          
          Two dark shapes are chasing the prey.   Each has a light.
          Hunters.

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, GROVE OF TREES - CONTINUOUS

          The prey dodges various TRAPS, one after another. A metal
          cage slams shut, a hidden net, darts on a trip wire.

          
          The prey runs into a clearing surrounded by rocks: a dead end.

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, CLEARING - CONTINUOUS

          The hunters surround the prey, stepping out into the light: a
          sinister Doberman Pinscher, a Rottweiler, and a bulldog, each
          wearing large, HIGH-TECH COLLARS.

          
          They surround the prey.   Escape looks impossible.
          WOOSH! The bird moves impossibly fast, jumping over the
          three dogs and escaping in a flash.

          
          The dogs head off in pursuit.
          A HIGH PITCHED SQUEAL stops the dogs short, their ears
          wincing in pain. They whimper and run off.

          

                                                                   38.

          

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, THICK JUNGLE - DAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          Carl steps out from behind a shrub.   The SQUEALING is in fact
          his HEARING AID.

          

                              CARL
                    Darn thing.
                        (calling back)
                    C'mon, Russell, would you hurry it up?

          
          Russell plods forward, dragging his feet.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    I'm tiiiired. And my knee hurts.

          

                              CARL
                    Which knee?

                              RUSSELL
                    My elbow hurts and I have to go to
                    the bathroom.

          

                              CARL
                    I asked you about that five minutes
                    ago!

                              RUSSELL
                    Well, I didn't have to go then!
          Russell goes limp and lies face down in the dirt.

                              RUSSELL
                    I don't want to walk anymore.     Can
                    we stop?

          

                              CARL
                    Russell! If you don't hurry up,
                    the tigers will eat you.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    There's no tigers in South America.
          Russell rolls over to show Carl a badge.

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Zoology.

                              CARL
                    Oh, for the love of Pete. Go on into
                    the bushes and do your business.

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Okay!   Here, hold my stuff.

          

                                                                     39.

          

          
          Somehow energized, Russell jams his pack into Carl's hands,
          secures his rope to a tree and tromps off into the shrubs.

          
          He goes into the woods carrying a small shovel in one hand
          and a pile of leaves in another.

                              RUSSELL
                    I've always wanted to try this!

          
          Carl waits, standing by the tree his house is tied to.

                              RUSSELL (O.S.)
                    Mr. Fredricksen? Am I supposed to
                    dig the hole before or after?

          

                               CARL
                    Eugh!   None of my concern!
          Beat.

          

                                RUSSELL (O.S.)
                    Oh.    It's before!

          
          Carl covers his ears.

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, THICK JUNGLE - CONTINUOUS


          
          Russell pats down a mound and SIGHS in satisfaction.

          
          He is about to return to Carl when he spots some TRACKS.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Huh?  Tracks?!

                        (REALIZING)
                    Snipe!
          Russell follows the tracks into the dark jungle, clapping.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Here, snipe... Come on out, snipe.
                    Snipe!
          The footprints continue for a time, then stop.

          

                                RUSSELL
                    Huh.
          Russell munches on a chocolate bar.

          
          Something RUSTLES in the bushes behind him.   He turns to look.
          Behind him, A BEAK takes a nibble of the chocolate and zips
          out.

          

                                                                      40.

          

          
          Russell turns.    Nothing there.

          
          Another nibble!   Zip!

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Ha! Gotcha!

          
          Russell peers into the shrub.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Don't be afraid, little snipe. I
                    am a Wilderness Explorer so I am a
                    friend to all of nature. Want some
                    more?

          
          Russell holds out the chocolate.   The beak pokes out and
          nibbles.

                                RUSSELL
                    Hi boy.    Don't eat it all.   Come on
                    out.

          
          The beak zips back into the bushes.

                             RUSSELL
                    Come on. Don't be afraid little
                    snipe. Nice snipe. Good little
                    snipe. Nice...
          A massive shadowy creature rises up over Russell.

                              RUSSELL
                    ...giant snipe!

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, THICK JUNGLE CLEARING


          
          Carl checks the knot on his hose harness.    Russell and the
          massive creature step up behind him.

                              RUSSELL
                    I found the snipe!

          

                              CARL
                        (humoring him)
                    Oh, did you?

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Are they tall?

          

                              CARL
                    Oh yes, they're very tall.

          

                                                                   41.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Do they have a lot of colors?

          

                              CARL
                    They do indeed.

                              RUSSELL
                    Do they like chocolate?

          

                               CARL
                    Oh ye-   Chocolate?

          
          Carl turns to look.
          Next to Russell stands a 13 foot tall, multicolored BIRD.

          
          Carl SCREAMS.

                              CARL
                    What is that thing?!

                              RUSSELL
                    It's a snipe!

                              CARL
                    There's no such thing as a snipe!

          

                              RUSSELL
                    But you said snipes eat--

          
          Carl grabs Russell, pulling him away from the bird.

          
          The bird HISSES at Carl and grabs Russell back.   It cradles
          Russell like a baby.

          

                                RUSSELL
                    Whoah!
          Russell GIGGLES.

          
          Carl pokes at the bird with his cane, trying to scare it off.

                              CARL
                    Go on, get out of here. Go on!
                    Shoo!

          
          The bird HISSES.
          It takes Russell up into a tree, swinging him around
          playfully. It looks scary and fun.

          

                              RUSSELL

                        (LAUGHING)
                    Whoah! Whoah!

          

                                                                        42.

          

          

                              CARL
                    Careful, Russell!

          

                              RUSSELL

                        (LAUGHING)
                    Hey, look Mr. Fredricksen, it likes
                    me!

          

                                 CARL
                    Russell!
          The bird grooms Russell.

          

                              RUSSELL

                        (LAUGHING)
                    No stop, that tickles!

          
          Carl pokes the bird with his cane.

                              CARL
                    Get out of here.    Go on, git!

          
          The bird sets Russell down.     It stalks Carl, HISSING and
          ruffling its feathers.

          

                                 CARL
                    Aaaah!

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Uh-oh! No no no no no Kevin, it's
                    okay. Mr. Fredricksen is nice!

          
          Russell pats Carl on the head.

                                 CARL
                    "Kevin"?

                              RUSSELL
                    Yeah, that's his name I just gave
                    him.

          
          The bird pats Carl on the head with its beak.

                              CARL
                    Hey. Beat it! Vamoose! Scram!

          
          Carl waves his cane.    The bird eats it.

                               CARL
                    Hey!   That's mine!

          
          The bird chokes and the cane comes back up.

          

                                                                  43.

          

          

                               CARL
                    Aaah!   Shoo, shoo! Get out of here.

          
          Carl shoos the bird away.     The bird mimics him.

          

                              CARL
                    Go on, beat it.

          
          GRUMBLING, Carl gives up and throws his hands in the air.

          
          The bird mimics this as well.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Can we keep him? Please?? I'll
                    get the food for him, I'll walk
                    him, I'll change his newspapers...

          

                                 CARL
                    No.

                    That doesn't even rhyme.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Yeah it does.
          Russell points up to the roof of Carl's house.

          

                                 RUSSELL
                    Hey, look!     Kevin!

          

                              CARL
                    What? Get down! You're not
                    allowed up there!

          
          The bird is on Carl's roof. It swallows a balloon. It POPS.
          The bird coughs up the deflated balloon. Russell GIGGLES.

                    You come down here right now!

          
          The bird jumps down and hides behind Russell.

                               CARL
                    Sheesh!   Can you believe this, Ellie?

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Ellie?
                        (gets idea)

                              (MORE)

          

                                                                  44.
                              RUSSELL (cont'd)
                    Uh, hey Ellie, could I keep the
                    bird? Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
                        (to Carl)
                    She said for you to let me.

          

                              CARL
                        (to Ellie)
                    But I told him no --
                        (catches himself)
                    I told you no! N-O.
          The bird HISSES at Carl.

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, ROCKY LANDSCAPE - DAY


          
          Carl and Russell pull the house through the mist.
          Russell discreetly drops chocolate pieces along their trail.

          
          The bird follows, eating.

          

                              CARL
                    I see you back there!

          
          It "hides" behind a rock, still totally visible.

          

                              CARL
                    Go on, get out of here. Shoo! Go
                    annoy someone else for a while.

                              VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hey, are you okay over there?
          The bird dashes away.

          

                                 CARL
                    Uh, hello?

          
          Carl and Russell look around. In the midst, some 100 feet
          away, they see the FIGURE OF A MAN.

                               CARL
                    Oh!   Hello sir!    Thank goodness.

          
          Carl walks toward the man.

                              CARL
                    It's nice to know someone else is
                    up here!

          

                              VOICE
                    I can smell you.

          

                                                                  45.

          

          
          Carl stops.

          

                                CARL
                    What?    You can smell us?

          

                              VOICE
                    I can smell you.

          
          As they get closer, they realize the man is in fact a ROCK.

          

                                CARL
                    Hey.

          
          Russell GIGGLES.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    You were talking to a rock.
          Russell points to another rock shape.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Hey, that one looks like a turtle!

          
          Sure enough.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Look at that one!     That one looks
                    like a dog!
          The "rock" walks forward.

                              RUSSELL
                    It is a dog!

                                CARL
                    What?

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Uh, we're not allowed to have dogs
                    in my apartment.
          The dog nuzzles Russell, who nervously pets it.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Hey, I like dogs!

          

                              CARL
                        (calls out)
                    We have your dog!
                        (to self)
                    Wonder who he belongs to?

                                RUSSELL
                    Sit boy.

          

                                                                 46.

          

          
          The dog sits.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Hey look, he's trained!    Shake!

          
          The dog raises his paw and Russell shakes it.

          

                                RUSSELL
                    Uh-huh.    Speak.

          

                                DUG
                    Hi there.

          
          Carl and Russell freeze.

          

                              CARL
                    Did that dog just say "Hi there?"

                                DUG
                    Oh yes.
          Carl JUMPS back.

          

                              DUG
                    My name is Dug. I have just met
                    you and I love you.

          
          Dug jumps up on to Carl.

                                CARL
                    Uh..wha?

          
          Dug wears a high-tech collar. The dog's thoughts come out of
          it as words through a speaker. It can talk. Unfortunately,
          it talks non-stop.

          

                              DUG
                    My master made me this collar. He
                    is a good and smart master and he
                    made me this collar so that I may
                    talk -- SQUIRREL!!
          Dug stares transfixed at a tree.    False alarm.

          

                              DUG
                    My master is good and smart.

                              CARL
                    It's not possible.

          

                              DUG
                    Oh it is, because my master is
                    smart.

          

                                                             47.

          

          

                                 RUSSELL
                       Cool! What do these do, boy?

          
          He inspects the collar and twists a dial.

          

                                 DUG
                       Hey would you-

                           (CLICK)
                       -cuerdo con tigo-

                           (CLICK)
                       I use that collar-

                           (CLICK)
                       -watashi wa hanashi ma-

                           (CLICK)
                       -to talk with, I would be happy if
                       you stopped.

          

                                 CARL
                       Russell, don't touch that. It could
                       be radioactive or something.
          Dug sniffs the ground around Carl and Russell.

          

                                 DUG
                       I am a great tracker. My pack sent
                       me on a special mission all by
                       myself. Have you seen a bird? I
                       want to find one and I have been on
                       the scent. I am a great tracker,
                       did I mention that?
          BAM!   The bird tackles Dug and HISSES.

          

                                 DUG
                       Hey, that is the bird! I have
                       never seen one up close but this is
                       the bird.
                           (to Carl)
                       May I take your bird back to camp
                       as my prisoner?

          

                                 CARL
                       Yes! Take it! And on the way,
                       learn how to bark like a real dog!

          

                                 DUG
                       Oh I can bark!
          Dug BARKS.

          

                                 DUG
                       And here's howling!
          Dug HOWLS.    The bird HISSES at Dug.

          

                                                                    48.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Can we keep him? Please please
                    please?

          

                                CARL
                    No.

          
          Russell falls to his knees, pleading.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    But it's a talking dog!

          

                              CARL
                    It's just a weird trick or
                    something. Let's get to the falls.

          
          Carl grabs Russell.   The bird follows, as does Dug.

                              DUG
                    Please be my prisoner. Oh please oh
                    please be my prisoner.

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, THICK JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY


          
          Footprints.   A dog's nose follows the tracks.   This is GAMMA,
          a bulldog.

          

                              GAMMA
                    Oh, here it is.    I picked up the
                    bird's scent!

          
          A second dog: BETA, a Rottweiler.

                               BETA
                    Wait a minute, wait a minute! What
                    is this? Chocolate. I smell
                    chocolate.

          

                              GAMMA
                    I'm getting prunes and denture
                    cream! Who are they?

                              BETA
                    Ah man, Master will not be pleased.
                    We'd better tell him someone took
                    the bird, right Alpha?
          ALPHA, a Doberman pinscher, sits with his back to them.

          

                              ALPHA
                        (high-pitched voice)
                    No. Soon enough the bird will be
                    ours yet again.

          

                                                                       49.

          

          
          Alpha's voice is high and squeaky, as if he's breathed in
          helium.

          

                              ALPHA (CONT'D)
                    Find the scent, my compadres and
                    you two shall have much rewardings
                    from Master for the toil factor you
                    wage.

          
          Beta and Gamma look at each other.

                              BETA
                    Hey Alpha, I think there's
                    something wrong with your collar.
                    You must have bumped it.

          

                              GAMMA
                    Yeah, your voice sounds funny!
          Beta and Gamma LAUGH.   Alpha turns.   They stop laughing.

                              ALPHA
                    Beta. Gamma. Mayhaps you desire
                    to -- SQUIRREL!

          
          All three dogs look for the squirrel.   False alarm.

          

                              ALPHA (CONT'D)
                    Mayhaps you desire to challenge the
                    ranking that I have been assigned
                    by my strength and cunning?

          

                              BETA
                    No no. But maybe Dug would.     You
                    might want to ask him.

          
          Beta and Gamma SNICKER derisively.

                              GAMMA
                    Yeah, I wonder if he's found the
                    bird on his very special mission.

                              ALPHA
                    Do not mention Dug to me at this
                    time. His fool's errand will keep
                    him most occupied, most occupied
                    indeed. Ha ha ha. Do you not
                    agree with that which I am saying
                    to you now?

          

                              BETA
                    Sure, but the second Master finds
                    out you sent Dug out by himself,
                    none of us will get a treat.

          

                                                                     50.

          

          

                              ALPHA
                    You are wise, my trusted
                    Lieutenant.

          
          Alpha powers up a video screen on Beta's collar.

                              ALPHA (CONT'D)
                    This is Alpha calling Dug.   Come
                    in, Dug.

          
          The screen shows ground moving past: the view from Dug's
          collar.

          

                                DUG
                    Hi Alpha.    Hey, your voice sounds
                    funny.

          

                              ALPHA
                    I know, I know!   Have you seen the
                    bird?

                              DUG
                    Why yes, the bird is my prisoner
                    now.

          

                              GAMMA
                    Yeah, right.

          
          The screen view adjusts to see the bird.   It hisses.

          

                              ALPHA
                    Impossible! Where are you?!

          

                              DUG
                    I am here with the bird and I will
                    bring it back and then you will
                    like me. Oh, gotta go.
          On the collar screen, the dogs get a fleeting glimpse of a
          boy's face. It's Russell.

          

                              RUSSELL
                        (on video screen)
                    Hey Dug! Who you talking to?

          
          The video screen goes blank.   The dogs BARK excitedly.

                              BETA
                    What's Dug doing?

          

                              GAMMA
                    Why's he with that small mailman?

          

                                                                    51.

          

          

                              BETA
                    Where are they?

          
          Alpha pushes a button on Beta's collar.    A TRACKING DEVICE
          locates Dug.

                              ALPHA
                    There he is. Come on!

          
          The dogs sprint off into the jungle.

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, JUNGLE - DAY

          The bird drags Dug, still clamped onto it's leg.

          

                              DUG
                    Oh please oh please oh PLEASE be my
                    prisoner!

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Dug, stop bothering Kevin!

          

                              DUG
                    That man there says I can take the
                    bird and I love that man there like
                    he is my master.

          
          The bird HISSES.

          

                              CARL
                    I am not your master!

          
          The bird tries to shake Dug off its leg.   Dug jumps up on it.

          

                              DUG
                    I am warning you, once again, bird!

                                 RUSSELL
                    Hey!     Quit it!

          

                              DUG
                    I am jumping on you now, bird.

          
          Russell tries to separate them, which pulls on Carl's tether.

          

                              CARL
                    Russell! At this rate we'll never
                    get to the falls!

          
          Carl pulls on the tether, knocking Russell over.   Carl falls,
          pulling the house into a tall rock. SMASH!
          Carl GASPS.   He turns his anger to the group.

          

                                                                   52.

          

          

                              CARL
                    I am nobody's master, got it?
                        (points to bird)
                    I don't want you here,
                        (points to Dug)
                    ...and I don't want you here.
                        (points to Russell)
                    I'm stuck with you. And if you two
                    don't clear out of here by the time
                    I count to three-
          Dug sees the tennis balls on Carl's cane.

          

                               DUG
                    A ball!   Oh boy oh boy!     A ball!

          

                               CARL
                    Ball?
          Carl pops off one of the tennis balls.

          

                              CARL
                    You want it boy?     Huh?   Huh?   Yeah?

                              DUG
                    Oh oh oh! Yes, I do.        I do ever so
                    want the ball!

          

                              CARL
                    Go get it!!
          Carl throws the ball far away.    Dug chases after it.

          

                              DUG
                    Oh boy, oh boy! I will get it and
                    then bring it back!

          

                              CARL

                        (WHISPERS)
                    Quick Russell, give me some chocolate.

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Why?

          

                              CARL
                    Just give it to me!
          Carl grabs some chocolate and waves it at the bird.

          

                               CARL
                    Bird.   Bird!
          Carl THROWS the chocolate.     The bird runs after it.

          

                                                                        53.

          

          
          Carl grabs Russell and runs.

          

                              CARL
                    C'mon Russell!

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Wait.   Wait, Mr. Fredricksen.

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN HILLSIDE

          Carl pulls them down a slope.     He slips.

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN TREETOPS


          
          Above the tree line, the house SMASHES into a tree.

                                 CARL
                    Daah!

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN STREAM

          Carl and Russell crossing the river balance on rocks.        Carl
          slips and his foot goes into the water.

          

                                 CARL
                    Aaahh...

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN JUNGLE


          

                              RUSSELL
                    What are we doing?

          
          Carl pushes through thick jungle leaves.      BUGS buzz around him.

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN STEEP HILLSIDE


          
          Carl climbs up the hill.      He FALLS over a dead branch.

                              RUSSELL
                    Hey, uh, we're pretty far now.
                    Kevin's gonna miss me.

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, JUNGLE CLEARING - CONTINUOUS


          
          They climb over a ridge.      Dug and the bird are nowhere in sight.
          Carl sits down on a rock, BREATHING HARD.

          

                                                                         54.

          

          

                                CARL
                      I think that did the trick.

          
          He turns.   Dug.     With the ball in his mouth.

          

                                DUG
                      Hi, Master.

          

                                   CARL
                      Afternoon.
          Carl turns the other way.       The bird.   It HONKS at him.

          
          Dug drops the slobbery ball on Carl's lap.

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, FLAT ROCKY AREA - NIGHT

          A clap of thunder. Lightning flashes reveal rain pouring
          down on the house. Beneath it, Carl and Russell are kept
          dry, sitting around a pathetic flickering campfire.

          
          Carl looks at Dug, asleep, wrapped around the bird's leg.        He
          rolls his eyes and looks up at the house.

          

                                CARL
                      Well, thanks for keeping us dry
                      anyway, Ellie.

                                RUSSELL (O.S.)
                      Which one's the front?

          
          Russell struggles to set up the tent.       He reads his manual.

                                RUSSELL
                      Is this step three, or step five?
          Carl ROLLS HIS EYES at Russell's ineptness.

          

                                   RUSSELL
                      There!
          Russell struggles with a tent pole, trying to winch it into
          place.

          
          Carl can't watch.
          An off screen SMACK!      Russell walks to Carl.   Miraculously,
          he looks unscathed.

          

                                   RUSSELL
                      All done.
          Russell turns, revealing a large RED WELT on his face.

          

                                                                  55.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                        (pointing to tent)
                    That's for you!

          
          The tent pole springs loose, catapulting the tent over the
          cliff.

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Awh.   Tents are hard.

          

                              CARL
                    Wait, aren't you "Super Wilderness
                    Guy?" With the GPM's and the badges?

                              RUSSELL
                    Yeah, but... can I tell you a
                    secret?

                               CARL
                    No.

                              RUSSELL
                    Alright, here goes. I never
                    actually built a tent before.
                    There. I said it.

                              CARL
                    You've been camping before, haven't
                    you?

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Well, never outside.

          

                              CARL
                    Well, why didn't you ask your Dad
                    how to build a tent?

                              RUSSELL
                    I don't think he wants to talk
                    about this stuff.

          

                              CARL
                    Why don't you try him sometime?
                    Maybe he'll surprise you.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Well, he's away a lot.   I don't see
                    him much.

          

                              CARL
                    He's got to be home sometime.

          

                                                                   56.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Well, I called, but Phyllis told me
                    I bug him too much.

          

                              CARL
                    Phyllis? You call your own mother
                    by her first name?

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Phyllis isn't my mom.
          Carl realizes he put his foot in it.

          

                               CARL
                    Oh.

          
          The two sit silently together, watching the fire.

                              RUSSELL
                    But he promised he'd come to my
                    Explorer ceremony to pin on my
                    Assisting the Elderly badge, so he
                    can show me about tents then,
                    right?

          
          Carl studies Russell's sad optimism.   He looks at the missing
          badge on Russell's sash.

          

                              CARL
                    Hey, uh, why don't you get some
                    sleep. Don't want to wake up the
                    traveling flea circus.

          
          Dug nuzzles around the sleeping bird's leg.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Mr. Fredricksen, Dug says he wants
                    to take Kevin prisoner. We have to
                    protect him!

          
          Russell YAWNS and lies down on the rock next to Carl.

                              RUSSELL
                    Can Kevin go with us?

          

                               CARL
                    Alright.   He can come.

                              RUSSELL
                    Promise you won't leave him?

          

                               CARL
                    Yeah.

          

                                                                    57.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Cross your heart?

          
          Carl looks down at Russell.

          

                              CARL
                    Cross my heart.

          
          Carl sits at the campfire, the others asleep.    He shakes his
          head and looks up at the house.

                              CARL
                    What have I got myself into, Ellie?

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, FLAT ROCKY AREA - MORNING

          A frog sits next to Carl's glasses. It CROAKS. Carl's hand
          smacks it like an alarm clock. The frog hops away.

          
          Carl rises, looking up at the house.

                              CARL
                    Morning Sweetheart.

          
          The balloons on the house are wilting.

                              CARL
                    We better get moving.

          
          He scans the camp.   The bird is gone.

                              CARL
                    Huh. Bird's gone. Maybe Russell
                    won't notice.
                        (calls out)
                    Alright, everybody up!

          
          Russell sits up with a SNORT.

                              RUSSELL
                    Where's Kevin? He's wandered off!
                    Kevin! Dug, find Kevin!

          
          Dug crazily searches and sniffs, looking for the bird.

                              DUG
                    Find the bird.    Find the bird...

                    POINT!
          Dug goes rigid like a pointer dog and "points" to the left.

          

                                                                   58.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Oh, look! There he is.

          
          Russell points to the right.   The bird is on top of Carl's
          house.
          Dug turns around.

          

                              DUG

                    POINT!
          The bird has gathered a pile of food on Carl's roof.

          

                              CARL
                    Hey, that's my food!   Get off my
                    roof!

          

                              DUG
                    Yeah, get off of his <>!

          
          In the distance, BABY BIRDS call out.   The bird CALLS back.

          

                              CARL
                    What is it doing?

          

                              DUG
                    The bird is calling to her babies.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Her babies! Kevin's a girl?
          The bird gobbles the food and jumps off the roof.

          

                              DUG
                    Her house is over there in those
                    twisty rocks.
          Miles off is a huge grouping of rocks; the LABYRINTH.   The
          baby birds call from somewhere inside.

          

                              DUG
                    She has been gathering food for her
                    babies and must get back to them.

          
          The bird "hugs" Russell goodbye and pats Carl on the head
          with her beak. She HISSES at Dug.

                              RUSSELL
                    Wait, Kevin's just leaving? But
                    you promised to protect her!

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Her babies need her, we gotta make
                    sure they're together.

          

                                                                   59.

          

          
          The bird hurries off toward the labyrinth.   Carl gathers up
          the hose tether.

          

                              CARL
                    Sorry Russell. We've lost enough
                    time already.

          

                                 RUSSELL
                    Yeah...

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, EDGE OF JUNGLE - MOMENTS LATER


          
          The bird rounds a corner and hears rustling in the bushes
          ahead. She scampers back toward the house.

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, FLAT ROCKY AREA

          Russell chews on some chocolate.

                              RUSSELL
                    This was her favorite chocolate.
                    Because you sent her away, there's
                    more for you.
          Carl rolls his eyes and SIGHS.

          
          They hear rustling from the bushes behind them.

          

                                 CARL
                    Huh?

          

                                 RUSSELL
                    Kevin?

          
          Beta and Gamma, run toward Carl and Russell, viciously
          barking and growling. Carl protects Russell with his cane.

          
          Dug is conflicted.

          
          Alpha walks forward and stares menacingly at Carl.
          He turns toward Dug.

          

                              ALPHA
                        (high-pitched voice)
                    Where's the bird? You said you had
                    the bird.

          

                              DUG
                    Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Since I have
                    said that, I can see how you would
                    think that.

          

                                                                      60.

          

          

                              ALPHA
                    Where is it?

          

                              DUG
                    Uh, tomorrow. Come back tomorrow
                    and then I will again have the
                    bird. Yes.

          
          Alpha BARKS angrily.

          

                              ALPHA
                    You lost it. Why do I not have a
                    surprised feeling? Well, at least
                    you now have lead us to the small
                    mailman and The One Who Smells of
                    Prunes.

          
          Carl and Russell look at Dug.    He turned on them!   Dug
          shamefully lowers his head.

          

                              ALPHA
                    Master will be most pleased we have
                    found them, and will ask of them
                    many questions.
                        (commanding, to Carl)
                    Come!

          

                              CARL
                    Wait, we're not going with you.
                    We're going to the falls!
          Gamma and Beta BARK fiercely at Carl.

          

                              CARL
                    Get away from me! Get down!

          
          The dogs lead Carl and Russell like prisoners.    Dug follows.
          The house is pulled after them, and on the roof: THE BIRD.

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, DESOLATE ROCKY AREA - DAY

          Alpha leads Carl and Russell through a canyon.

          
          Dogs patrol the tops of the canyon walls.
          Four more large dogs join the group.    Carl and Russell watch
          warily and continue their march.

          
          They round a bend.     Before them is a MASSIVE CAVE OPENING.

          

                                                                      61.

          

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, CAVE ENTRANCE


          
          The house and balloon canopy are dwarfed as the group
          approaches the huge cave opening.

          
          DOZENS OF DOGS step out of the cave. Carl and Russell stop.
          More dogs approach from the side. Every way Carl turns there
          are more dogs!

          
          Growling and snarling, the dogs surround Carl and Russell.
          Closer... closer...

          
          From the darkness a voice:

                               VOICE (O.S.)
                    Stay!

          
          The dogs stop. A figure peers out from the darkness.      It
          examines Carl, Russell, and the floating house.

          

                              VOICE
                    You came here in that?

          

                              CARL
                    Uh... yeah.

                              VOICE
                    In a house? A floating house?
          The man laughs.   Carl and Russell laugh along nervously.

                               VOICE
                    That is the darndest thing I've
                    ever seen! You're not after my
                    bird, are you? But if you need to
                    borrow a cup of sugar, I'd be happy
                    to oblige!
          The dogs LAUGH uproariously at the man's joke.

          

                              VOICE
                    Well, this is all a misunderstanding.
                    My dogs made a mistake.

          
          The figure walks out toward Carl into the light.   Carl
          recognizes him!

                              CARL
                    Wait, are you Charles Muntz?!

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Well... Yes.

          

                                                                    62.

          

          

                              CARL
                    The Charles Muntz?

          
          Muntz gives him the "thumbs up."

          

                              MUNTZ
                    "Adventure is out there!"

          
          Carl GIGGLES with glee.

          

                              CARL
                    It's really him!
                        (to Russell)
                    That's Charles Muntz!

                              RUSSELL

                        (EXCITED)
                    It is?!?

                        (CONSIDERS)
                    Who's Charles Muntz?

          

                                CARL
                    Him!

          

                                DOG WALLA
                    Yes!    It is him! He is!

                              CARL
                    I'm Carl Fredricksen. My wife and
                    I, we were your biggest fans!

          
          Carl rushes to shake Muntz's hand.    Muntz is charmed.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Well, you're a man of good taste!

          
          Muntz LAUGHS at his joke.    Carl joins in.

                              MUNTZ
                    You must be tired.     Hungry?

          

                                RUSSELL
                    Uh-huh.

                              MUNTZ
                        (to dogs)
                    Attention everyone! These people
                    are no longer intruders. They are
                    our guests.

          
          The dogs CHEER.

          

                                                                  63.

          

          

                              DOG WALLA
                    Follow me! I like you temporarily.
                    You do smell like prunes. I will
                    not bite you.

          
          Muntz walks into the cave. Carl and Russell excitedly follow.

          

          INT. CAVE - CONTINUOUS


          

                                CARL
                    Wow.

          
          Carl's eyes adjust to the dark. Muntz's dirigible the
          "Spirit of Adventure" is tethered in the cave.

          

                              MUNTZ (O.S.)
                    I'm sorry about the dogs -- hope
                    they weren't too rough on you.

          

                              GAMMA (O.S.)
                    We weren't!

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Go ahead and moor your airship
                    right next to mine.

          
          Muntz gestures to a pylon, where Carl ties off the house.
          Muntz and the dogs walk up the gangplank of the dirigible.

          

                              CARL
                    We're not actually going inside the
                    "Spirit of Adventure" itself?!

                                MUNTZ
                    Oh.    Would you like to?

                              CARL
                    Would I?!?!

          
          Carl GIGGLES like a little boy.

                              CARL
                    Wait up, Mr. Muntz!

          
          Carl and Russell follow up the ramp.

                              CARL
                    Jiminy Cricket.

          
          Dug follows, but is blocked by Alpha and Beta.

                                BETA
                    Not you.

          

                                                                      64.

          

          

                              GAMMA
                    What do we do with Dug?

          

                              ALPHA
                    He has lost the bird.     Put him in
                    the Cone of Shame.

          
          Dug WHIMPERS.

          

          EXT. DIRIGIBLE GANGPLANK - MOMENTS LATER


          
          Alpha, Gamma and Beta walk into the dirigible.   Dug sits
          forlornly with a PLASTIC CONE around his neck.

          

                              DUG
                    I do not like the Cone of Shame.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE - TROPHY ROOM

          Carl and Russell are speechless as they walk into the room.
          It's a treasure trove of giant skeletons, stuffed creatures,
          and rare cultural artifacts.

          
          Various servant dogs dust and polish as Muntz leads Carl and
          Russell through the room.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Most of the collection is housed in
                    the world's top museums: New York,
                    Munich, London... `Course I kept
                    the best for myself.

                              CARL
                    Did you ever! Will you look at that?

                              MUNTZ
                    Oh yes, the Arsinoitherium. Beast
                    charged while I was brushing my
                    teeth. Used my shaving kit to
                    bring him down.
          A dog approaches carrying a menu.    Muntz waves it off.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Oh, surprise me.
                        (to Carl)
                    Only way to get it out of Ethiopia
                    at the time was to have it declared
                    as "dental equipment!"
          Muntz LAUGHS.   Behind him, a dog can't resist gnawing at one
          of the bones.

          

                                                                  65.

          

          

                              CARL
                    Oh my gosh, the Giant Somalian
                    Leopard Tortoise!

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Oh, you recognize it? I'm
                    impressed! That's an interesting
                    story there...

          
          A dog approaches with a bottle of champagne in his mouth.
          Muntz glances at the bottle.

          

                               MUNTZ
                    Hm, excellent choice.
                        (to Carl)
                    I found it on safari with
                    Roosevelt.
          Two dogs work together to remove the cork from the bottle.
          POP! They sloppily pour two glasses.

                              MUNTZ
                    He and I fell into a habit of
                    playing gin rummy in the evenings.
                    And did he cheat? Oh, he was
                    horrible!

          
          Muntz and Carl LAUGH.   Alpha interrupts.

                              ALPHA
                        (high-pitched voice)
                    Master, dinner is ready.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Oh dear, broken translator.   It's
                    that loose wire again.
                        (leans down, fixes it)
                    There you go big fella.

          

                              ALPHA
                        (deep scary voice)
                    Thank you Master.
          Russell reacts.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    I liked his other voice.
          Muntz LAUGHS.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Well, dinner is served!    Right this
                    way.

          

                                                                    66.

          

          

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, DINING ROOM


          
          Muntz leads Carl and Russell into the dining room and up to a
          large table.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    So how are things stateside?
                    Almost tempted to go back a few
                    times, but I have unfinished work
                    here... Please.
          Dogs pull back chairs for them.   They sit.   Dog waiters place
          napkins on their laps.

                              MUNTZ
                    I hope you're hungry because
                    Epsilon is the finest chef I've
                    ever had.
          Dogs bring out covered plates, look at each other, and remove
          the silver plate covers at the same time. The meals look
          delicious.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Oh, Epsilon, you've done it again!

                              RUSSELL
                    Yes!!
          Russell is served a hot dog.   His waiter can't resist and
          eats a bite.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Hey!

          
          Another dog pours some juice then takes a big slurp from his
          glass.

                              RUSSELL
                    Hey!

          
          Carl looks around, still enthralled.

                              CARL
                    Oh my Ellie would have loved all
                    this. You know, it's because of
                    you she had this dream to come down
                    here and live by Paradise Falls.

          
          He gestures toward HIS HOUSE, tethered outside the porthole
          window.

          

                                                                    67.

          

          

                              MUNTZ
                    I'm honored. And now you've made
                    it!

          

                              CARL
                    You're sure we're not a bother?
                    I'd hate to impose.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    No no! It's a pleasure to have
                    guests -- a real treat.

          
          The dogs erupt into excited barking.

                               DOG WALLA
                    Treat?!   Treat! I want a treat!

          

                              MUNTZ
                    No no, quiet! Calm down.     Calm
                    down...
          In the excitement a dog swipes the rest of Russell's hot dog.

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Hey!

                              MUNTZ

                        (CONT'D)
                    Shouldn't've used that word...
                    Having guests is a delight. More
                    often I get thieves, come to steal
                    what's rightfully mine.

                               CARL
                    No!

          
          Muntz picks up a lantern and walks to the back of the room.

                              MUNTZ
                    They called me a fraud, those...
                    dah! But once I bring back this
                    creature, my name will be cleared.
          The lantern illuminates photographs, drawings, samples,
          feathers. Hundreds of them... all of THE BIRD. Kevin.

          
          This is Muntz's obsession. He looks over to a full size
          skeleton.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Beautiful, isn't it? I've spent a
                    lifetime tracking it. Sometimes
                    years go by between sightings...

          

                               (MORE)

          

                                                                   68.
                              MUNTZ (cont'd)
                    I've tried to smoke it out of that
                    deathly labyrinth where it lives...
                    Can't go in after it. Once in,
                    there's no way out. Lost so many
                    dogs...
          Muntz is lost in reverie.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    And here they come, these bandits,
                    and think the bird is theirs to
                    take! But they soon find that this
                    mountain is a very dangerous
                    place.

          
          Distracted Russell finally notices the skeleton.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Hey, that looks like Kevin!

          

                                 MUNTZ
                    "Kevin?"

          

                             RUSSELL
                    Yeah! That's my new giant bird
                    pet. I trained it to follow us.

          
          Muntz and Alpha exchange glances.

                              MUNTZ
                    Follow you? Impossible.      How?

          

                              RUSSELL
                    She likes chocolate.

          
          Russell holds up a chocolate bar to show Muntz.

                                 MUNTZ
                    Chocolate?

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Yeah, I gave her some of my
                    chocolate. She goes ga-ga for it.

          
          Carl swipes the chocolate from Russell and pockets it.

          

                              CARL
                    But it ran off!      It's gone now.

          
          Muntz stares.

          
          He walks to a table full of flight helmets.

          

                                                                   69.

          

          

                              MUNTZ
                    You know, Carl. These people who
                    pass through here, they all tell
                    pretty good stories. A "Surveyor"
                    making a map.
          Using his cane, Muntz topples a helmet from the table.   It
          rolls across the floor.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    A "Botanist" cataloguing plants.

          
          Muntz topples another helmet.
          He lifts a third to show Carl.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    An old man taking his house to
                    Paradise Falls.

          
          He drops the helmet.   It rolls to Carl's feet.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    That's the best one yet. I can't
                    wait to hear how it ends.
          Carl glances around nervously.

          
          Out the window, sitting on the roof of his house, sits THE

          BIRD!

                              CARL
                    Well! It's been a wonderful
                    evening, but we'd better be going.

          
          Carl gets up and pulls Russell from the table.

                              MUNTZ
                    Oh, you're not leaving?

          

                              CARL
                    We don't want to take advantage of
                    your hospitality. Come on Russell.

          
          Carl leads Russell toward the door.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    But we haven't even had dessert
                    yet.

          
          Muntz follows behind them slowly, menacingly.

          

                                                                          70.

          

          

                                MUNTZ
                      No, the boy's right. You haven't
                      had dessert. Epsilon here makes a
                      delicious Cherries Jubilee.

          
          Carl pulls Russell along, Muntz following behind like
          something out of a bad dream.

          

                                MUNTZ
                      Oh, you really must stay. I
                      insist! We have so much more to
                      talk about!

          
          A distant HAUNTED WAIL.         Everyone stops.

          

                                   RUSSELL
                      Kevin?
          Muntz walks to the window and looks out.          Atop the roof he
          sees THE BIRD.

                                   MUNTZ
                      It's here.
          He turns back to Carl... but they're gone.

                                MUNTZ
                          (to dogs)
                      Get them!

          

          INT. CAVE


          
          Carl and Russell untie Carl's house from the pylon.

          

                                   CARL
                      Hurry!

                                RUSSELL
                      I am hurrying!

          
          Dogs descend down the ramp behind them.

                               RUSSELL
                      They're coming!

          
          Carl and Russell run toward the cave opening.
          Dogs block the cave opening.        Carl stops short.

          

                                DUG (O.S.)
                      Master, over here!

          

                                                                         71.

          

          
          Dug points to a tunnel opening deeper inside the cave.     Carl
          and Russell run toward him.

          
          The cave leads to a steep incline.      The dogs are getting
          closer.
          There's no choice but to JUMP.

          
          The lift from the overhead balloons allows Carl and Russell
          to leap down the incline, like astronauts.

                              DUG
                    Go toward the light, master!
          Dogs climb down the rocks, closing in on Carl and Russell.

          
          The bird sees the dogs. She jumps off the house and lifts
          Carl and Russell on her back.
          She runs through the cave, towing the house behind her.
          Russell and Carl HANG ON for dear life.

          
          BANG BANG BANG! Balloons pop as they scrape across the
          ceiling. The house lowers.

          
          Ahead, a giant rock sits in their path. Carl tugs at the
          house but it CRASHES against the rock, pulling Russell onto
          the ground.

                                 CARL
                    Russell!

          
          Dragging on the ground, Russell gets BUMPED around badly.

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, CANYON - CONTINUOUS

          The dogs close in on Russell. Alpha bites at his heels.
          Carl fends off Alpha with his cane.

          

                                 CARL
                    Get back!!
          Alpha is about to bite when an avalanche of boulders rains
          down! The dogs stop short.

          
          Carl looks back as the bird keeps running.      Dug is up on the
          canyon wall. He caused the avalanche!

          

                              DUG
                    Go on Master!       I will stop the
                    dogs!
          Dug jumps down to block the path of the approaching dogs.

          

                                                                        72.

          

          

                               DUG
                    Stop you dogs!!

          
          The dogs run around Dug.

          
          Alpha bites Dug by the neck and throws him out of the path.

          
          The bird carries Carl, Russell dragging along behind.    She
          rounds a corner. Russell SWINGS OUT over the abyss.

          
          The bird jumps from rock spire to spire.   Russell swings back
          and forth wildly in the air.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Help! Help!

          
          Russell does the WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL.

                              CARL
                    Gimme your hand!
          Carl holds out his cane so that Russell can GRAB it and Carl
          PULLS him back onto the bird.
          Meanwhile Dug manages to rejoin his friends, but just in time
          to reach the end of the line -- A CLIFF EDGE.   A river winds
          100 feet below.

          
          Carl looks above to see the house's momentum pulling forward.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Hang on to Kevin!

          
          Carl grabs onto Kevin and picks Dug up by the collar.

          
          Just as the dogs reach our gang, the house's momentum carries
          them across the chasm. Alpha bites the bird on the leg but
          is kicked loose and falls into the river below.

          
          Carl LANDS HARD but safely across the river chasm.     The dogs
          are stuck on the other side.
          Carl painfully gets up.    He looks up at his house.   It's
          still intact.

          
          He breathes a SIGH OF RELIEF.

                              RUSSELL (O.S.)
                    Kevin!

          
          The bird tries to stand but SQUAWKS pitifully and falls back
          to the ground. Russell rushes to her side.

          

                                                                     73.

          

          
          The bird's leg has been injured badly by the dog bite.   She
          can't stand.

          
          Russell applies a bandage.

          
          From the distant labyrinth of rocks, the BIRD BABIES call.
          Kevin CALLS back to them. She tries to stand, but can't.

          
          Russell runs to her side.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    No no no! Kevin! Stay down.
                        (to Carl)
                    She's hurt real bad. Can't we help
                    her get home?

          
          Carl looks at the bird's wounds.   He looks to the rock maze,
          then to his house.
          He knows the right thing to do.    And he hates himself for it.

                               CARL
                    Alright.   But we've got to hurry.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT


          
          Dripping wet dogs cower in front of a menacing Muntz.

                              MUNTZ
                    You lost them?

          

                              BETA
                    Uh, it was Dug.

          

                              GAMMA
                    Yeah, he's with them.    He helped
                    them escape!

          
          Muntz snarls in anger.

          

                               MUNTZ
                    Wait.   Wait a minute.   Dug...

          
          He leans over a RADAR TRACKING DEVICE.

          

                                                              CUT TO:

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS


          
          DUG'S COLLAR SCREEN powers on, and a signal zeroes in on
          Dug's location.

          

                                                                     74.

          

          
          Dug, oblivious, looks out over the landscape, sniffing.

          
          Carl and Russell peek out from behind a tree.

          

                              CARL
                    See anything?

          

                              DUG
                    No, my pack is not following us!
                    Boy they are dumb.
          Dug scampers back to Carl and Russell, who pull the house
          from behind a tree canopy.

                              CARL
                    This is crazy. I finally meet my
                    childhood hero and he's trying to
                    kill us! What a joke.

                              DUG
                    Hey, I know a joke. A squirrel
                    walks up to a tree and says I
                    forgot to store acorns for winter
                    and now I am dead. Ha! It is funny
                    because the squirrel gets dead.
          They pull the house, keeping it hidden behind the trees.

          

                              CARL
                    Careful Russell.
          The house bumps into a tree, jostling the injured BIRD on the
          porch.

                              RUSSELL
                    You okay, Kevin?
          Kevin goes back to sleep.    Russell looks at her BANDAGED LEG.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    You know what, Mr. Fredricksen?
                    The wilderness isn't quite what I
                    expected.

          

                               CARL
                    Yeah?   How so?

                              RUSSELL
                    It's kinda... wild. I mean, it's
                    not how they made it sound in my
                    book.

                              CARL
                    Hmm, get used to that, kid.

          

                                                                    75.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    My dad made it sound so easy. He's
                    really good at camping, and how to
                    make fire from rocks and stuff. He
                    used to come to all my Sweatlodge
                    meetings.

          
          Russell smiles at the thought.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    And afterwards we'd go get ice
                    cream at Fentons. I always get
                    chocolate and he gets butter-
                    brickle. Then we'd sit on this one
                    curb, right outside, and I'll count
                    all the blue cars and he counts all
                    the red ones, and whoever gets the
                    most, wins. I like that curb.
          He looks up at Carl.

                              RUSSELL
                    That might sound boring, but I
                    think the boring stuff is the stuff
                    I remember the most.
          They walk in silence.   Carl understands.

          
          The bird babies CALL OUT in the distance.    Kevin CALLS BACK.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Look, there it is!

          
          Russell spots the labyrinth, now close by.   He tries to run
          but is pulled back by his tether.

          
          LAUGHING, Carl unclips Russell's tether.

                              CARL
                    Hold on Russell, stand still!

          
          Carl ties the hose harnesses to a tree, securing the house.
          Russell helps Kevin off the porch and the group run toward
          the labyrinth entrance.

          
          Kevin is reenergized by the sound of her babies.   She runs
          off ahead. Carl and Russell LAUGH.

          

                              CARL
                    Look at that bird go!

                              CARL
                    Wait up, you overgrown chicken!

          

                                                                      76.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    That's it, go Kevin!      Go find your
                    babies!

          
          Just as they approach the entrance to the labyrinth, a fierce
          spotlight hits them. MUNTZ'S DIRIGIBLE lowers overhead.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Run Kevin! Run!

          
          A net shoots out and binds her. She falls and CALLS OUT.

          

                                RUSSELL
                    Oh no!

          
          The net catches on a rock. Carl and Russell run to her aid.

          

                              CARL
                    Russell, give me your knife!

          
          Carl saws frantically at the net.

          

                              MUNTZ (O.S.)
                    Get away from my bird!

          
          Muntz and his dogs descend from the dirigible.     Beside them,
          a group of dogs drag forward CARL'S HOUSE.

          
          Muntz hurls a lit lantern.      Flames burst up beneath the house.

          
          Heat waves ripple up.   Balloons POP.    Carl's house LOWERS
          into the fire.

          Inside the living room, Ellie's photo crashes to the floor.

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, LABYRINTH GATE - CONTINUOUS


          

                                CARL
                    No!

          
          Carl panics.    He rushes toward the house, dropping the knife.

          
          Muntz motions to the dogs. They swarm past Russell, knocking
          him down and grabbing the bird in the net.

          

                                RUSSELL
                    No!
          Carl pulls his house away from the flames.

          

                                                                     77.

          

          
          The bird CALLS OUT plaintively as the dogs drag her into the
          dirigible.

          
          Muntz follows the bird up the ramp of the dirigible.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Careful. We want her in good shape
                    for my return.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Let her go! Stop!

          
          Russell runs after the dogs, but the gangplank closes.
          The dirigible flies off.

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Kevin!
          Carl beats out the flames with his jacket.     He extinguishes
          the flames.

          
          Carl collapses on the side of his house.

                              RUSSELL
                    You gave away Kevin.   You just gave
                    her away.

          

                              CARL
                    This is none of my concern.      I
                    didn't ask for any of this!

          

                               DUG
                    Master.   It's alright.

          

                              CARL
                    I am not your master! And if you
                    hadn't a shown up, none of this
                    would have happened! Bad dog! Bad
                    dog!

          
          Dug slinks off, tail between his legs.
          Carl angrily puts on the harness.

          

                              CARL
                    Now, whether you assist me or not,
                    I am going to Paradise Falls if it
                    kills me.

          
          He walks off.   Russell falls in behind.
          An angry dawn breaks.

          

                                                                    78.

          

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, ROCKY TERRAIN - DAY


          
          Now barely aloft, Carl pulls the house across the rocky
          landscape.

          
          Russell's harness drags along side, empty.

          
          Russell walks behind.

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN HILLSIDE - MORNING


          
          With the last of his energy, Carl drags the house into place.
          The house groans as it comes to rest.

          
          Carl drops the hose harness and walks to the edge of a cliff.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS - MORNING


          
          He looks over. He's finally made it: Paradise Falls.
          Torrents of water careen over the massive cliff edge.

          
          Carl takes out Ellie's childhood drawing.    Next to him stands
          the real house, just like Ellie wanted.

                                RUSSELL (O.S.)
                    Here.
          Behind him, Russell throws his sash on the ground.

                              RUSSELL
                    I don't want this anymore.
          Russell walks away.   He sits on a rock, alone.

          
          Carl picks up the sash.   He walks up the steps of his house.

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          The door opens. Carl steps in.   He's back in his house for
          the first time in days.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Carl and Ellie's things are strewn across the floor, a mess
          from the rough journey.

          
          Carl rights Ellie's chair, sets the lamp upright, slides the
          table into position.
          He pushes their two chairs back into their place.

          

                                                                   79.

          

          
          Carl closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and sits.

          
          Quiet.

          
          Nothing, save the distant sound of the falls outside.
          Carl surveys the room.

          
          The ADVENTURE BOOK rests on a table near him.   He opens it
          and puts Ellie's drawing back.
          He looks through the pages, remembering the newspaper
          clippings and old photographs, the dreams of young Ellie.
          He turns to the page marked: STUFF I'M GOING TO DO.

          
          Carl sighs. He managed to bring the house to the falls, but
          Ellie never made it.
          He closes the book.   But as he does, Carl sees something he
          hadn't before.

          
          The blank pages at the end are no longer blank.
          A WEDDING PHOTO of the two of them.
          On a picnic. Celebrating birthdays. Another and another...
          photos of their ordinary life together, the ups and downs.
          Carl's face warms. Ellie lived the life she wanted: she saw
          adventure in everyday life.

          
          A photo of the two of them sitting side by side, together, in
          their chairs. Beneath it, Ellie has written:

          

             "THANKS FOR THE ADVENTURE -- NOW GO HAVE A NEW ONE!

             LOVE, ELLIE."
          Carl smiles.

          
          He looks over to Ellie's empty chair.   On the arm is
          Russell's sash. Carl picks it up.
          He looks to Ellie's chair.

          
          He crosses his heart.

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER


          
          Carl walks from the house and calls from the porch.

                                CARL
                    Russell?

          

                                                                     80.

          

          
          But Russell is nowhere to be seen.

          
          A shadow crosses Carl. He looks up to see Russell floating
          off, hanging from a BUNCH OF BALLOONS.

          

                               CARL
                    Russell!

          

                              RUSSELL
                    I'm gonna help Kevin even if you
                    won't!

          
          Russell fires up a LEAF BLOWER and steers himself off into
          the sky.

          

                              CARL
                    No, Russell! No!
          Carl runs back to his house and tries in desperation to lift
          it. He struggles, but the house doesn't budge. The balloons
          have lost too much helium.

          
          Furious, he THROWS a chair off his porch.    It lands atop the
          mountain rocks with a thud.

          
          This gives him an idea.

          

                                                              CUT TO:
          The GRAMOPHONE smashes onto the rocky ground. Chairs,
          dressers, tables; Carl throws them all out of the house.

          
          Slowly, one corner of the house lifts.   Then another.
          Carl struggles to push a refrigerator from the porch.    It
          teeters... and falls. The house lifts off!

                               CARL
                    Wahhoo!

          
          The house floats off into the sky, leaving a huge pile of
          things. Beside it sits Carl and Ellie's chairs, side by side
          atop Paradise Falls.

          

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING

          The house soars into the air, sails billowing.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM

          Inside the house, Carl adjusts his steering, scans the skies.

          

                                                                    81.

          

          
          KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.    Carl's eyes go wide.

          

                                 CARL
                    Russell?

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - CONTINUOUS


          
          The door swings open.

          

                                 CARL
                    Dug!

          

                              DUG
                    I was hiding under your porch
                    because I love you. Can I stay?

          

                              CARL
                    Can you stay? Well, you're my dog
                    aren't you? And I'm your master!

                              DUG
                    You are my master?!
          Dug lunges forward and overwhelms Carl with dog kisses.

                                 DUG
                    Oh boy.     Oh boy!

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING - CONTINUOUS


          
          The house flies off into the sky.

                              CARL (O.S.)
                    Good boy, Dug. You're a good boy!

          

          EXT. OPEN SKY - DAY


          
          Russell steers through the clouds toward the DIRIGIBLE.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE - CONTINUOUS


          
          Dogs play poker. Behind them, Russell flies past with the
          leaf blower. They turn to look.

          

          EXT. DIRIGIBLE


          
          Russell steers wobbly toward an open dirigible window.    He
          smashes into the wall.

          

                                                                     82.

          

          

                                 RUSSELL
                    Ooph!

          
          He tries again and TUMBLES through the window.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE - CONTINUOUS


          
          Russell releases the balloons and picks up the leaf blower,
          ready for action.

                                RUSSELL
                    Yes!    Don't worry Kevin! I'll save -
          Growling dogs move toward him.

          
          Russell blows the leaf blower at the dogs.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, CAGE ROOM

          Muntz stares into the bird's cage, mesmerized.     She's
          miserable and scared.

                              MUNTZ
                    And they wouldn't believe me. Just
                    wait till they get a look at you.

          
          Alpha enters.

                    What?

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE


          
          Dogs tie Russell to a chair.

                                 RUSSELL
                    Let me go!

          
          Muntz enters.

                              MUNTZ
                    Where's your elderly friend?

          
          Russell blows the leaf blower in Muntz's face.

                              RUSSELL
                    He's not my friend anymore.

          

                                                                    83.

          

          
          Muntz grabs the leaf blower and drags Russell out.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Well, if you're here, Fredricksen
                    can't be far behind.

                    Let me go!

                    I'll unleash all my Wilderness
                    Explorer training!

          
          Muntz is about to throw a switch when he looks out the
          porthole. Flying toward him is CARL'S HOUSE!

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Alpha! Fredricksen's coming back.
                    Guard that bird. If you see the
                    old man, you know what to do.

          
          Muntz pulls the switch and walks out of the room.

                              RUSSELL
                    Hey, where are you going?    I'm not
                    finished with you!

                              MUNTZ
                    Nice talking with you.

          
          Muntz slams the door.
          Light emerges from the floor.    Russell is on the ramp, which
          is opening. Russell REACTS.

          

                                                                    84.

          Carl steers toward the cockpit. He dons Russell's sash, then
          hooks his cane onto his back. He's fighting for a cause.
          He hears SCREAMING. It's Russell! Tied to his chair, he
          slides down the ramp as it lowers, closer and closer to the
          edge.

          

                               CARL
                    Russell!
          Carl steers his house to the dirigible.

          

          

          EXT. DIRIGIBLE, RAMP - CONTINUOUS

          Carl flings the hose, HOOKING it to the ramp railing. Using
          his cane as a zip line, Carl slides to Russell, catching him
          just as Russell slides off the ramp edge. They land safely
          together.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Mr. Fredricksen!

          

                               CARL
                    Dug!   Bring `er over!
          Dug winches in the hose caddy, pulling the house closer to
          the dirigible ramp.

          
          Carl carries Russell into the house.

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS


          
          Carl sets Russell, still bound, down in the front hall.

          

                                                                     85.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    You came back for Kevin!     Let's go
                    get her.

          

                              CARL
                    I'm getting Kevin.    You stay here!

          

                              RUSSELL
                    But I want to help!

          

                              CARL
                    I don't want your help.     I want you
                    safe!
          Carl leaps back into the dirigible.    Dug follows.

          
          Russell STRUGGLES against his bonds.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, HALLWAY


          
          Carl and Dug sneak down a hall. They see dogs ahead and hide.

                              CARL
                    How do we get past these dogs?

                              DUG
                    Uh... POINT!
          Dug points to a grate in the wall.

          

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, GAS CELL AREA

          Dug leads Carl "backstage" through a vent shaft into the
          dirigible. They sneak past two biplanes.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, CAGE ROOM


          
          They emerge through a grate near the ceiling. They look down
          into the room where the bird is kept in a cage.

                              CARL
                    Kevin!

          
          The bird recognizes Carl and CRIES OUT.

                              CARL
                    Don't worry Kevin, we're on our
                    way!
          Alpha enters, leading a group of dogs. Carl and Dug duck
          into the shadows and watch unnoticed from above.

          

                                                                       86.

                    Allow no one to be entering through
                    these doors. Guard well that bird,
                    my minions.

          

                              CARL

                        (WHISPERS)
                    What do we do now, Dug?

          
          Dug is lost in ecstacy, chomping on a tennis ball on the end
          of Carl's cane.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, CAGE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER


          
          Carl drops down from the ceiling and stands on the cage.      He
          bangs his cane. All the dogs turn.
          He grabs a ball from his cane and waves it in the air.

          

                              CARL
                    Who wants the ball?

          

                              DOGS
                    Me! I do! I want the ball!

                              CARL
                    Then go get it!
          Carl throws the ball.    The dogs scramble after it.

          

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF CAGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          The dogs pile into the hallway in pursuit.

          

                              DOGS
                    I'm gonna get there first! Oh gonna
                    get the ball! I'm gonna get it!

          
          Gamma catches it..

                                 GAMMA
                    I got it!!

          
          Behind them Carl shuts the door.    The dogs realize their
          mistake.

                                 GAMMA
                    Uh-oh.

          Carl opens the cage door.

          

                              CARL
                    I'm sorry Kevin.      Let's get you out
                    of here.

          

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT

          Muntz scans the horizon.    Suddenly the in-ship communicator
          comes to life.

                              DOG WALLA

                    bird's gone!

                    What?    Calm down!   One at a time!

          

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FRONT PORCH

          Russell STRUGGLES to break free of the chair.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    I want to help!
          He manages to get his arms free.

          

                                RUSSELL
                    Ha ha!

          
          Except that all his struggling causes the chair to hop out on
          the porch and fall off.

          
          Russell SCREAMS as he falls.     The hose unspools.

          
          Russell reaches the end of the hose. Russell grabs onto it
          and the chair jostles free, falling thousands of feet down.

          
          The house drifts away from the dirigible.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT


          
          The melee of conflicting reports from the dogs continues.

                    Does anyone know where they are?!?!

          
          On cue, Russell SPLATS into the dashboard window of the
          control room and SQUEEGEES across, dangling from the hose.
          Muntz stares, slack-jawed.

                                 RUSSELL
                    Whoooaaah!

          
          The house floats off.

          Russell clings to the end of the hose, swaying in the wind.

          
          What's that noise?   From beneath the dirigible emerges...

          

          EXT. OPEN SKY - CONTINUOUS


          
          From beneath the dirigible, three spitfire airplanes emerge.
          As they get closer, it is clear they are being flown by DOGS.

          Russell SCREAMS, swaying beneath it on the hose.

          Carl, Dug and the bird escape through the trophy room.

          Behind the door, Muntz is waiting for them.       He grabs a sword
          from the wall display and attacks.
          Dug hears and BITES Muntz on the leg.

          
          Muntz kicks Dug loose and out the door.    He slams it shut.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, OUTSIDE OF TROPHY ROOM - CONTINUOUS


          
          Locked out, Dug jumps on the door and barks.

          
          He hears growling and turns around.    There stands Alpha and
          the other dogs.

                                 DUG
                      Hi.

          Dug runs.   The dogs give chase.

          

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, TROPHY ROOM

          Muntz swings his sword at Carl but misses.    Carl uses his
          cane to defend himself.

          

          OLD MAN SWORD FIGHT!
          Muntz smashes his trophy collection as he swings for Carl.
          His sword gets stuck in a mounted skeleton.
          Carl swings his cane and hits Muntz on the head. The tennis
          balls bounce the cane off Muntz and smack Carl in the face.

          
          Muntz pulls the sword free. He raises the sword over his
          head to strike and his back CRACKS loudly. He's stuck! Carl
          raises his cane over his head and his back CRACKS too.

          
          Carl and Muntz STRUGGLE to move. Muntz CRACKS his back free
          and kicks Carl in the chest, knocking him against a trophy.
          He has the upper hand now. He throttles him with his arm and
          lifts his sword.

          

                                MUNTZ
                      Any last words, Fredricksen?   Come
                      on, spit it out!
          Carl spits his FALSE TEETH at Muntz.    He falls backwards.

          

                                                                        90.

                    Come on!

          
          Muntz advances on Carl, who struggles to protect the bird.

          
          Muntz is a wild man now, smashing and destroying anything
          that gets in his way.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Enough! I'm taking that bird back
                    with me alive or dead!
          Carl trips and falls to the floor.     Muntz is about to deal
          the final blow.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT


          
          Meanwhile Alpha backs Dug into the control panel.        He bumps a
          a LEVER.

          The entire dirigible rocks wildly to the side.

          

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, TROPHY ROOM

          Muntz is knocked off balance.     He slides to one side.    Trophy
          cases slide after him.
          The dirigible tilts to the other side.

          
          The broken trophy cases barrel straight toward Carl!
          Carl is thrown into a window which bursts open. Carl falls
          through but manages to grab the frame with his cane. He
          dangles out over open air.
          He sees the biplanes circling the house, Russell hanging
          beneath it.

          
          The ship corrects again.      Carl climbs back inside.
          Muntz comes at Carl.

          

                              CARL
                    Come on, Kevin!

          pushes the bird along as he goes.

          
          Muntz follows up.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT


          
          Alpha throws Dug viciously across the room. Alpha throws him
          again and Dug crashes into the steering wheel, knocking a
          radar shade off the control panel.
          Alpha moves in.     Dug hides behind the steering wheel.

          

                              ALPHA
                    I will have many enjoyments for
                    what I am about to do, Dug.

          
          Alpha lunges at Dug through the steering wheel.    Dug cowers,
          but then notices the RADAR SHADE.

          
          As Alpha lunges again, Dug jams the shade over Alpha's head.
          Alpha's head is stuck, trapped by the cone.
          The dogs all GASP.

          howl with laughter.

                    Listen you dog!     Sit!
          Surprised at Dug's moxy, Alpha sits.    All other dogs sit too.

          

                              DOG WALLA
                    Yes, Alpha.

          

                                                                   92.

          

          

                              DUG
                    Alpha? I am not Alpha, he is-

                    Oohhhh!

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE


          
          Russell TRIES TO CLIMB the hose.   His hands are about to give
          out.
          The biplanes head straight at Russell.

          

                              RUSSELL
                        (out of breath)
                    I can't do it!

          
          Behind him, Carl is climbing the side of the dirigible for
          dear life, Muntz closing in.

          

                              CARL
                        (far in the distance)
                    Russell!

                                RUSSELL
                    Huh?

          
          Carl calls for help: the WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL.

                              RUSSELL
                    You leave Mr. Fredricksen alone!

          
          Russell CLIMBS!
          He's more machine than boy now. Biplanes shooting the whole
          way, he climbs up onto the porch.
          The biplanes close in.

          
          Russell yells to them.

          

                                RUSSELL
                    Hey!
                        (pointing down)
                    Squirrel!

          
          All the dog pilots snap to attention.

                                GAMMA
                    Squirrel?

          

                              OMEGA
                    Where's the squirrel?!

          

                                                                     93.

          

          
          The planes dive, crash into each other.   The dog pilots
          parachute out.

          

                               GAMMA
                     I hate squirrels.

          

          EXT. SIDE OF DIRIGIBLE


          
          Carl climbs. Muntz grabs Carl's foot. Carl defends himself
          with his cane, knocking Muntz off the ladder. Muntz catches
          on to a rung of the ladder.

          
          He watches Carl and the bird climb.

          
          Muntz descends the ladder.

          

          EXT. DIRIGIBLE, TOP - DAY


          
          Carl and the bird make it to the top of the dirigible.
          Suddenly, a trap door opens. Carl GASPS... but it's Dug!

          

                               CARL
                     Dug!
          Dug jumps up on Carl, licking his face.

          

                               DUG
                     Master!
          The house bears down on them.    They run to meet it.

          

                               CARL
                     Russell!! Over here!!    Let's go!

          
          Russell steers the house toward Carl.

                               RUSSELL
                     Mr. Fredricksen!

          
          The house slows and lowers atop the airship.    Carl HOISTS the
          bird up onto the porch.

          

                               CARL
                     Come on, Kevin!
          Carl helps Dug onto the porch.   He climbs up himself...

          
          BLAM!   Muntz appears on top of the dirigible with a rifle!

          
          A bullet blasts through Carl's balloon strings. A third of
          them break or shoot skyward. The house plummets, crashing
          onto the dirigible.

          

                                                                     94.

          

          
          Carl is THROWN from the house onto the airship.

          
          The house slides toward the edge, Russell, Dug and Kevin
          still inside.

          

                                 CARL
                      No!

          
          Carl SCRAMBLES to grab the hose trailing from the sliding
          house. The house slides on to the dirigible's tail fin.
          Holding the hose, Carl digs in his heels and is just able to
          stop it.

          
          The house teeters on the very edge of the tail fin.

          

                                CARL
                     Russell!   Get out of there!
          Russell, Dug and Kevin run toward the front porch.

          
          BLAM!   A bullet smashes the door jam next to them.

          
          Muntz storms toward the house.    Carl holds desperately to the
          hose.

          

                                 CARL
                     No!    Leave them alone!

          
          Russell and others duck inside and slam the door.

          
          The house tilts, threatening to tip off at any second.   Carl
          holds on for his life.

          
          Muntz POUNDS on the door with the butt of the rifle.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, HALLWAY

          Russell, Dug and Kevin back away from the door.

          

          

          EXT. DIRIGIBLE, TOP

          The house slides farther over the edge.

          
          Carl struggles to hold on. The hose caddy is ripping free
          from the house! The bolts pop from the wooden siding... it's
          about to go!

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE

          Russell, Dug and Kevin run into the living room.

          

                                                                    95.

          

          

          

          EXT. DIRIGIBLE, TOP


          
          Muntz KICKS the door.

          
          Suddenly, Carl has an idea.

                                CARL
                      Russell! Hang on to Kevin! Don't
                      let go of her!

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM

          Confused, Russell follows Carl's directions.   He Dug and the
          bird huddle together.

          
          Muntz breaks through the door.    He lifts his rifle and sights
          the bird...
          Through the window, Carl yells out.

          

          

          EXT. DIRIGIBLE, TOP


                                 CARL
                      Kevin!   Chocolate!

          
          Carl holds aloft a bar of chocolate.

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM


          
          Kevin lunges, pushing past Muntz and knocking the rifle from
          his hands.

          
          Muntz lunges after them.

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS


          
          The hose caddy breaks free.
          Kevin leaps through the window, Russell and Dug hanging from
          her side.

          
          Muntz leaps after them.
          But balloon strings tangle around his leg and pull him back.

          
          Muntz hangs for a moment... It's thousands of feet from the
          ground....
          He falls.

          

                                                                       96.

          

          

          

          EXT. DIRIGIBLE, TOP


          
          PANTING, Carl is left holding the hose.   He PULLS himself
          toward the edge.

          
          The hose curves beneath the tail fin.    Finally it swings
          out...

          

                              RUSSELL
                    That was cool!
          Russell and Dug dangle from it, sitting on Kevin.     The bird
          holds on to the hose with her beak.
          Carl LAUGHS, relieved.

          

                              CARL
                    Don't jerk around so much, kid!
          Russell climbs up, followed by the bird and Dug.

                              DUG
                    Oh I am ready to not be up high.
          Carl LAUGHS heartily as Dug jumps on him and licks his face.
          Carl looks into the distance. His house, now empty, floats
          softly down into the clouds, and disappears.

                              RUSSELL
                    Sorry about your house, Mr.
                    Fredricksen.

          
          Carl smiles.   He puts his arm around Russell.

          

                              CARL
                    You know, it's just a house.
          Carl, Russell, Dug and Kevin stand on the tail of the airship
          floating off over the clouds.

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, LABYRINTH GATE - AFTERNOON


          
          Carl and Russell hold and cuddle the baby birds.     The babies
          peck at Carl's head. Carl and Russell LAUGH.

          

                              CARL
                    Ow! Ow! Ow!

                              RUSSELL
                    Look at you. You're so soft.

          

                                                                       97.

          

          
          Kevin CALLS OUT, waiting for the babies at the gate to the
          LABYRINTH. Time to go.

          

                              CARL/RUSSELL

                        (DISAPPOINTED)
                    Awwww!

          

                              RUSSELL
                    I wish I could keep one.

          
          The babies run to the bird.      One stops to HISS at Dug.

          
          Carl has misplaced something.

                               CARL
                    Huh, where's my cane?      I just had
                    it here...
          Kevin starts HACKING.    She COUGHS up the cane.

          
          Babies start HACKING too.     They COUGH up tennis balls.

          

                              CARL
                    You know what? Keep `em.       A little
                    gift from me to you.
          The bird family enters the labyrinth.     Carl and Russell wave.

          

                                 RUSSELL
                    Bye Kevin!
          The bird looks back toward Carl and Russell and CALLS OUT one
          last time before disappearing into the mist.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT - LATER

          Carl and Russell both wear matching leather flight helmets
          and goggles.

          

                                 RUSSELL
                    Ready?
          Carl gives a thumbs up.

          

                                 CARL
                    Ready!

          Muntz's dirigible ascends into the sky. Dug and all of

          barking as they fly into the sunset.

          Each Junior Wilderness Explorer stands next to his father.
          As the Camp Master announces the achievement he hands the

                    Uh, Russell? Is there... someone
                    that... uh...

          
          The Camp Master CLEARS HIS THROAT uncomfortably.   Russell
          looks for his dad in the audience.

                              CARL (O.S.)
                    Excuse me. Pardon me.    Old man
                    coming through.
          Carl takes his place next to Russell.

          

                              CARL
                        (to Camp Master)

                    the call of duty, I would like to
                    award you the highest honor I can
                    bestow: The Ellie Badge.

          
          Carl pins the badge onto the missing spot on Russell's sash.
          It's Ellie's GRAPE SODA PIN.

          Carl smiles.

          
          They salute each other.      Russell gives Carl a hug.   Carl
          returns it.
          Russell's mom sits in the audience with Dug.     Russell proudly
          shows her the badge.

          Carl and Russell sit on a curb licking ice cream cones.
          Russell has chocolate and Carl has butter-brickle.

                    Mr. Fredricksen, you're cheating.

                              CARL
                    No, I'm not. Red one.

          He unzips a BACKPACK and sets it down beside him.

           How much does your life weigh?
                         
          Ryan pauses to let us consider this.

           Imagine for a second that you're
           carrying a backpack... I want you
           to feel the straps on your
           shoulders... You feel them?
           (gives us a beat)
           Now, I want you to pack it with all
           the stuff you have in your life.
           Start with the little things. The
           stuff in drawers and on shelves.
           The collectables and knick-knacks.
           Feel the weight as it adds up. Now,
           start adding the larger stuff. Your
           clothes, table top appliances,
           lamps, linens, your TV. That
           backpack should be getting pretty
           heavy at this point - Go Bigger.
           Your couch, your bed, your kitchen
           table. Stuff it all in... Your car,
           get it in there... Your home,
           whether you have a studio apartment
           or a two story house, I want you to
           stuff it into that backpack.

           Kinda hard, isn't it? This is what
           we do to ourselves on a daily
           basis. We weigh ourselves down
           until we can't even move. And make
           no mistake - Moving is living.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Now, I'm going to set your backpack
           on fire. What do you want to take
           out of it? Photos? Photos are for
           people who can't remember. Drink
           some gingko and let the photos
           burn. In fact let everything burn
           and imagine waking up tomorrow with
           nothing.
           (a beat of emphasis)
           It's kind of exhilarating isn't it?
           That is how I approach every day.

          We see a series of REAL PEOPLE react to the news of being
          fired. They should be non-actors (actual victims of recent
          layoffs) that can react organically to the news with
          authenticity. Some are hurt. Others are upset and even
          abusive. The series concludes with...

           Steve, I want you to review this
           packet. Take it seriously. I think
           you're going to find a lot of
           answers in there.

           Oh, I'm sure it's going be really
           helpful.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Look, anybody who ever built an
           empire, or changed the world, sat
           where you are now. And it's because
           they sat there that they were able
           to do it.
                         
          And just for a moment, Steve looks hopeful.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           I'm going to need your key card.
                         
                          STEVE
           Right...
                         
          Steve begins removing it from his wallet.
                         
                          RYAN
           Take the day. Put together your
           personal things. Talk to your co-
           workers. Tomorrow, go out and get
           some exercise. Go for a jog. Give
           yourself routines and pretty soon
           you'll find your legs.
                         
          Steve nods and gets up to leave. Just as he's about to walk
          out, he stops and turns back.
                         
                          STEVE
           Wait, how do I get in touch with you?
                         
                          RYAN
           Don't worry. We'll be in touch
           soon. This is just the beginning.
                         
          Steve nods and exits the room.

          INT. RYAN'S ROOM - PHOENIX HILTON - DAY
                         
          The choreography of Ryan's packing is worthy of Tchaikovsky.
                         
          A coat slides off a hanger... A travel toothbrush folds
          closed like a switchblade... A briefcase clicks onto a roll-
          away bag... A hand flips a light switch without looking.
                         
                         
          INT. LOBBY, PHOENIX HILTON - DAY
                         
          Ryan is at the check out desk.
                         
                          CHECKOUT GIRL
           Do you have your Hilton Honors Card
           with you?
                         
          Ryan smiles... "Do I?"
                         
          He hands it to her, close enough to camera, that we get a
          nice big close up of it. She runs the card and the screen
          pops up with information that makes her blush.
                         
                          CHECKOUT GIRL
           Oh my God... Do you like, live, at
           the Hilton?
                         
          Ryan nods in faux modesty.
                         
                         
          EXT. OUTDOOR CAR RETURN, HERTZ RENT-A-CAR - DAY
                         
          Ryan pulls up to one of the spaces marked with the #1 GOLD
          PRESIDENTS CLUB emblem. He hops out and a uniformed man with a
          handheld device begins to punch in the license plate number.
                         
          Ryan pulls out his HERTZ PRESIDENTS CLUB CARD and places it
          nice and close to lens so we can see it.
                         
          The card slides through the handheld device and we see the
          DIGITAL NUMBER increase by a few thousand points.
                         
                         
          INT. MAIN CONCOURSE, PHOENIX SKY HARBOR INTL AIRPORT - DAY
                         
          The automated GLASS DOORS slide open. Ryan enters the
          concourse and takes a deep breath of the temperately
          controlled air. He has arrived.
                         
           RYAN (V.O.)
           This is where I live.

          Ryan skips the long lines and steps directly into the
          AAdvantage Executive Platinum line.
                         
          Glorious close-up of Ryan's AAdvantage Executive Platinum
          CARD sliding through the AUTOMATED MACHINE. Were it any
          sexier, we'd hear a moan. Maybe we even do.
                         
          Immediately, the AIRPORT CLERK registers and perks up.
                         
                          AIRPORT CLERK
           Pleasure to see you again, Mr. Bingham.
                         
           RYAN (V.O.)
           When I run my card, the system
           automatically prompts the desk
           clerk to greet me with this exact
           statement.
                         
          We see it again...
                         
                          AIRPORT CLERK
           Pleasure to see you again, Mr. Bingham.
                         
          Ryan nods back to the clerk.
                         
           RYAN (V.O.)
           Had my status simply been gold or
           God-forbid, silver. I might have
           gotten a hello or a smile... Maybe.
                         
          Ryan continues to hit buttons, swiftly checking in.
                         
           RYAN (V.O.)
           Loyalty is earned and rewarded with
           these small touches. It's these kinds
           of systemized friendly touches that
           keep my world in orbit.
                         
          A ticket begins printing. Ryan snaps it up.
                         
                         
          INT. SECURITY - PHOENIX SKY HARBOR INTL AIRPORT - SAME
                         
          Ryan steps up and observes his line choices. He finds a few
          Asian businessmen and hops in behind them.

          RYAN MOVING THROUGH THE SECURITY SCREENING
                         
          It's a beautiful choreographed ballet of a bag handle
          collapsing, shoes coming off, a laptop going in a separate
          tray, wallet and watch sliding into a shoe, a boarding card
          sliding into a back pocket... both hands always moving,
          performing separate actions... It really is gorgeous.

          Ryan enters and presents his ADMIRALS CLUB CARD. It has a
          hologram. The ADMIRALS CLUB HOSTESS immediately smiles.
                         
           ADMIRALS CLUB HOSTESS
           Welcome back, Mr. Bingham.
                         
          Ryan walks past a stack of newspapers on the way to the
          buffet, the whole time framed by an enormous window
          overlooking the tarmac.
                         
           RYAN (V.O.)
           All the things you probably hate
           about travelling - The recycled air.
           The artificial lighting. The digital
           juice dispensers and mini pizzas
           stacked to their heat lamps are the
           warm reminders that I am home.
                         
          With that comment, Ryan slides into a leather club seat. A
          DIGITAL DISPLAY reads: "Thank You For Your Loyalty".
                         
          He opens his briefcase and pulls out his ITINERARY. He scans
          it. We see a string of flights, car rentals, and stays at
          Hitons. Then, something makes him frown. He pulls out his
          cell phone and dials...

          As the plane begins to taxi to the gate, both Ryan and the
          Businessman pull out their cards.

           We exchange cards and slot them next
           to countless others.
                         
          The dull bell "dings" to let us know it's safe to stand. Ryan
          and the Businessman get up and open the overheads.

          Ryan and the Businessman walk next to each, now completely
          ignoring each other as if they never shared a word.
                         
           RYAN (V.O.)
           Sad? Not really. We're a busy bunch.
           I'm peaceful. I'm in my element here.
           I suppose I'm a sort of mutation, a
           new species. I live between the
           margins of my itineraries.
                         
          Ryan and the Businessman reach a point that separates -
          CONNECTING FLIGHTS go left / LONG TERM PARKING goes right.
                         
          They share an awkward smile with a nod, then head in their
          separate directions.

           Hertz keeps its vehicles too long.

           (holds her hands eight
                          INCHES APART)
          Is it this big?
           (extends a few inches)
          ... this big?

           Let's just say I've got a number in
           mind and I haven't hit it yet.
                         
          Alex smiles, fair enough. Admires the CONCIERGE KEY CARD.
                         
                          ALEX
           This is pretty fucking sexy.
                         
                          RYAN
           I hope it doesn't cheapen our
           relationship.
                         
                          ALEX
           We're two people who get turned on
           by elite status. We may have to
           settle for cheap.
                         
                          RYAN
           There's nothing cheap about
           loyalty.
                         
          Alex looks into Ryan's eyes and gives him unspoken permission
          to take her right there and then.
                         
                         
          INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT
                         
          Ryan and Alex walk down a curved corridor, suppressing
          laughter. There's no adult way to go back to somebody's
          hotel room. Once at the door, Ryan tries his KEY CARD, but
          it doesn't work.
                         
          He reaches into his pocket and comes up with five other key
          cards from recent trips.
                         
                          RYAN
           I really have to start throwing
           these out.
                         
          He tries a couple.
                         
                          ALEX
           We can always use that room with
           the ice machine.
                         
          Ryan chuckles. He finds the right key and opens the door.

          The door closes. Ryan smiles to himself.

           RYAN (V.O.)
           Which means that I had to spend

                          NOSEY NEIGHBOR
           Feels like it's been months, busy man.
           We missed you at our Summer party.
                         
                          RYAN
           Yeah, sorry I couldn't be there.

           We've been trying to get a vote on

           the plans...? We'd love to get a
           final tally.
                         
                          RYAN
           It's fine. Really. I'll go with the
           majority.
                         
                          NOSEY NEIGHBOR
           Sometimes I forget that you even
           live here. You could probably save
           money and move into a hotel.

           I looked into it, but the IRS
           requires a permanent address for
           employment. Otherwise, they
           classify you as a vagrant.
                         
          Ding! - Ryan gets off at his floor.
                         
                          NOSEY NEIGHBOR
           Oh.

          empty... Like empty, empty.
                         
          Ryan opens the fridge - Chinese take out. Pizza box. Bottle
          of Vodka. Takes a whiff of something - not good.
                         
                          WOMAN'S VOICE
           Hey neighbor.
                         
          Ryan turns to find Dianne, a pretty woman just shy of forty.
                         
                          RYAN
           Hey yourself.
                         
          They hug - It's just intimate enough to know they've violated
          the rules of sleeping with your neighbors.
                         
                          DIANNE
           (hands over a package)
           I signed for this while you were gone.
                         
                          RYAN
           Thanks. Hope it wasn't a bother.
                         
          Ryan opens it and finds the CUT-OUT of his sister Julie and
          her fiance Jim. It's an eighteen inch card stock photo of Jim
          hugging Julie from behind.
                         
                          DIANNE
                          (RE: PHOTO)
           They seem happy.
                         
                          RYAN
           It's my sister. She's getting
           married. Haven't met the guy yet.
                         
                          DIANNE
           Lots of luck.

           I know, right?
                         
          They share a smile. Then, Dianne goes to leave.
                         
                          DIANNE
           It's good to see you. Feels like a
           while this time.
                         
                          RYAN
           Hey, you want to come over tonight?
                         
          Dianne gets a little uncomfortable.
                         
                          DIANNE
           Actually, I kind of started seeing
           somebody.
                         
                          RYAN
           Oh, that's... that's great.
                         
                          DIANNE
           Yeah, we're having drinks tonight
           if you want to come over.
                         
                          RYAN
           That's okay... I' think I'll settle in.
                         
          Dianne gives a smile/nod and exits. Ryan take another long
          look at the CUT-OUT. He shakes his head.

           one of the worst times on record
           for America... and I don't want to
           be standing here two years from
           now, wondering how we missed this
           window of opportunity.
                         
          A strangely encouraged response from the group.

           Now, last Summer we received a
           dynamite young woman by way of
           Cornell. She challenged us with some
           big ideas. My first reaction was, who
           does this kid think she is? But when I
           started to give a listen, I was pretty
           knocked out. So now, with a little
           peek into our future - Natalie Keener.
                         
          Natalie stands up.

           If there's one word I want to leave
           you with today, it's this...
                         
          Natalie clicks on her POWER POINT PRESENTATION.
                         
          POWER POINT SLIDE: "GLOCAL"
                         
          Everyone including Ryan attempts to pronounce it.

           This company keeps twenty three
           people on the road, at least two
           hundred fifty days a year. It's
           expensive and it's inefficient.
           When I came to Craig three months
           ago with this, he told me, and
           quite astutely - it's only a
           problem if you have a solution.

                          NATALIE (CONT'D)
           Well, today I stand before you with
           jus that.
                         
          She turns around and fires up her monitor. Sitting in a video
          conference session is a young man in a suit.
                         
                          NATALIE (CONT'D)
           You all know Ned in reception.
                         
          Various people say hello to Ned.
                         
                          NATALIE (CONT'D)
           Today, I'm going to fire Ned.
                          (ASIDE)
           Sorry, Ned. I'm sure H.R. will hire
           you back this afternoon.
                         
          Ned smiles. People chuckle in the conference room. One guy
          jokes "Don't count on it."
                         
                          NATALIE (CONT'D)
           Ned could be any employee in any one
           of our client's locations worldwide.
           Strategy packets would be shipped in
           advance. Ned would be given a seat
           and find one of our transition
           specialists waiting for him.
                         
          Natalie turns to the monitor and proceeds to fire Ned. It is
          a pretty dry process and lacks Ryan's charm.
                         
                          NATALIE (CONT'D)
           Mr. Laskin, the reason we're having
           this conversation today is your
           position is no longer available.
                         
                          NED
           (from a script)
           I don't understand. I'm fired?
                         
                          NATALIE
           Hearing the words "You've been let
           go" is never easy. Change is always
           scary. But consider the following -
           (using Ryan's line)
           Anybody who ever built an empire,
           or changed the world, sat where you
           are now. And it's because they sat
           there that they were able to do it.
                         
                          RYAN
                          (QUIETLY)
           That's my fucking line.
           27.
                         
                         
                          NED
           Well, what happens now?
                         
                          NATALIE
           This is the first step of a process
           that will end with you in a new job
           that fulfills you.
                         
                          NED
           Yeah, but, how does it work?
                         
                          NATALIE
           I want you to take that packet in
           front of you.
                         
          Ned picks up the packet.
                         
                          NATALIE (CONT'D)
           Review it. All the answers you're
           looking for are inside. Start
           filling out the necessary
           information and before you know it,
           you'll be on your way to new
           opportunities.
                         
          Ned starts to peruse the packet with fake interest.
                         
                          NATALIE (CONT'D)
           Now Ned, I'm going to need you to
           go back to your desk and start
           putting together your things. As a
           favor to me, I'd appreciate it if
           you didn't spread the news just
           yet. Panic doesn't help anybody.
                         
                          NED
           I understand.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Have a good day, Mr. Laskin and
           good luck with your future.
                         
                          NED
           Thank you.
                         
          Ned gets up and goes to leave.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Give it up for Ned.
                         
          People clap and tease him a little.

                          RYAN
           Tell me you're not taking this
           seriously.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Yeah, that's why we brought the
           entire company in from the road -
           Because we're not taking this
           seriously.
                         
                          RYAN
           It doesn't make any sense. It's...
                          (SEARCHING)
           ... completely impersonal.

           Who am I even talking to?
                         
                          RYAN
           There's a methodology to what I do.
           A reason why it works.

           Ryan, Coke and IBM have been doing
           it for years. Just like anything,
           there's a few months of transition,
           but everyone settles in.

           You don't get it. You're grounded, Ryan.
           Everyone is. It's done.
                         
                          RYAN
           Okay, what we do here is brutal and
           leaves people devastated, but there's
           a dignity to the way I do it.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Stabbing people in the chest
           instead of the back?
                         
          Ryan rolls his eyes.
                         
          Craig's door opens and Natalie pops her head in.
                         
                          NATALIE
           You wanted to see me?
                         
          Craig goes to wave her off.
                         
                          RYAN
           Yeah, why don't you come in.
                         
          Natalie is confused but takes the chair next to Ryan.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Great job in there, Nat.

           Thank you. How's everyone taking it?
                         
          Natalie and Ryan hold a look for a second.

           Look, I appreciate your... zeal. And
           you have some good ideas. But you
           know nothing of the realities of my
           job. Sure, you can set up an iChat...
           but you don't know how people think.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Actually, I minored in psychology.

           Ryan, stop it.
                         
                          RYAN
           She's going to be doing this on a
           regular basis. You don't want to
           know if she can fire somebody?
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           She just fired Ned.
                         
                          RYAN
           My dog could fire Ned.
                          (TO NATALIE)
           Fire me.

           It's okay, I got this.
                         
          Ryan and Natalie turn to face each other.

           today to discuss your future.
                         
                          RYAN
           My future? I don't know you. The
           only person who can fire me is
           Craig Gregory.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Mr. Gregory hired me to handle this
           for him.
                         
                          RYAN
           Handle what? Handle me? Mr. Gregory
           hired me and he's the only one who can
           fire me. I'm going to talk to him.
                         
          Ryan gets up. Natalie gets up too.

           I just did.
                         
                          RYAN
           Actually, you didn't. Now, fire me.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Stop it, Ryan.

                          (IGNORES CRAIG)
           Mr. Bingham, I'm here today to
           inform you that your position is no
           longer available.
                         
                          RYAN
           I'm fired?
                         
                          NATALIE
           Yes, you're fired.
                         
                          RYAN
                          (ASIDE)
           Never say fired.
                         
                          NATALIE
           You've been let go.
                         
                          RYAN
           Why?
                         
                          NATALIE
           (breaks the moment)
           This is a mythical situation. How
           could I possibly know why?
                         
                          RYAN
           You never know why. Why doesn't
           matter.
           32.
                         
                         
                          NATALIE
           (back on track)
           It's important not to focus on the
           "why" and rather to spend your
           energy thinking about your future.
                         
                          RYAN
           I'm going to spend my energy on
           suing you if you don't give me a
           reason that you're firing me.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Mr. Bingham, the reason is not
           important.
                         
                          RYAN
           Oh, so you're firing me without
           grounds.
                          (TO CRAIG)
           Now, I really have a lawsuit.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Ryan, I think we know what you're
           trying to say...
                         
                          NATALIE
           (still in character)
           Don't take this personally, Mr.
           Bingham.
                         
          Ryan stops.
                         
                          RYAN
           Personally?
           (quiet and calm)
           This is the most personal situation
           you will ever enter. So before you
           try to revolutionize my business,
           I'd like to know that you actually
           know my business.

                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Hell-of-a-way to welcome her to the

           Am I the only one who sees that by
           automating our own business, we're
           making ourselves irrelevant.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           (frankly...)
           No... We're making you irrelevant.
                         
          Ryan shoots a look.
                         
           CRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D)
           Hey, don't blame me. Blame fuel
           costs. Blame insurance premiums.
           Blame technology.
                          (A BEAT)
           Watch yourself, Ryan. You're too
           young to be a dinosaur...
                         
                          RYAN
           I'm not... I'm not a dinosaur.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           I want you to show her the ropes.
                         
                          RYAN
           What do I know about what happens
           around here? Have Ferguson do it.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           I'm not talking about here.
                         
          A beat as Ryan registers what Craig means: The Road.

           No.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Hey, you seem pretty confident that this
           girl doesn't know what she's doing...
                         
                          RYAN
           Excuse me. I just don't think a
           MySpace page qualifies you to
           rewire an entire company.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Great. Well, here's your chance.
           Show her the magic. Take her
           through the paces.

          Craig cups one of his hands and places a FOLDED POST-IT
          between his fingers like a ship's sail.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY

           This is the boat.
                         
          Craig raises his other finger far away.

           Do you want to be in the boat?
                         
                          RYAN
           Yes. Alone.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Ryan, we're ringing the bell.
           Rounding everybody up. If you want
           to stay out there a little longer,
           you can. But you're not going to be
           on your own.
           (begins to leave)
           Let me know.
                         
          Ryan churns.
                         
                         
          INT. RYAN'S APARTMENT - DAY
                         
          Ryan is packing his ROLL-AWAY BAG. It is practiced and
          systematic. He's just about finished, when he notices the CUT-
          OUT of his sister's engagement photo.
                         
          He tries placing it in the open bag, but it is immediately
          clear that the photo is two inches to long. He tries putting
          it on an angle, but that doesn't help.
                         
                          RYAN
           Huh.
                         
          Ryan centers the cut-out again and tries to ZIP around it,
          but he can't get the zipper around the HEADS of the photo.
          For a moment, it almost seems like he's assaulting their tiny
          head with the zipper handle. Doesn't help.
                         
          A moment of silent frustration.
                         
                          CUT TO:

          Being pulled through an airport. The little heads of Ryan's
          sister and her fiance are poking out the top of the bag. The
          two zippers have been closed on either side of them as though
          they were tiny passengers peeking out the sunroof.
                         
                         
          INT. EPPLEY AIRFIELD, OMAHA - MORNING
                         
          Ryan cuts right through the crowd, wheeling his carry-on
          towards the automatic check-in machines.
                         
          Ryan stops when he notices NATALIE saying goodbye to her
          BOYFRIEND - a kind of Hollister looking guy in his mid-
          twenties. He's not thrilled by the public affection. After a
          beat, they break and he exits.
                         
          Natalie sees Ryan and starts dragging her LARGE SUITCASE
          towards him. The SCRAPING against the terrazzo sends a shiver
          up Ryan's spine.
                         
          She arrives and sets the heavy bag down with a CLUNK. Ryan
          stares at her travel case for a beat then up to her.
                         
                          NATALIE
           What?
                         
                          CUT TO:

                          NATALIE
           I really like my luggage.

           You know how much time you lose by

           I'm building a work flow of firing
           techniques. Questions & responses.
           Actions & reactions. A script that
           works kind of like a tributary,
           taking you through the steps of
           firing someone.

           Theoretically, you could put it in
           the hands of anybody and they could
           be downsizing immediately. All they
           have to do is follow the steps.
                         
                          RYAN
           Natalie, what is it, you think we
           do here?
                         
                          NATALIE
           We prepare the newly unemployed for
           the emotional and physical hurdles
           of job hunting while... Minimizing
           potential legal blowback?
                         
                          RYAN
           That's what we're selling. But it's
           not what we're doing.
                         
                          NATALIE

           That was really impressive. You
           rehearse that?
                         
          Natalie smiles and goes back to her work. Ryan goes to say
          something, but holds back for now.

          Alex stops. She moves to a quieter place.
                         
                          ALEX
           Ryan, I'm not some waitress you
           banged in a snow storm. The word
           "Appropriate" has no place in our
           collective vocabulary. I'm the woman
           you don't have to worry about.
                         
                          RYAN

          an empty floor. Scattered telephones sit on the ground where
          desks used to be. A few desks in one corner are still manned.
                         
          Natalie tries not to show: It's all becoming very real.

           Thank you for coming by. As you're

           tough economic climate and your
           company is not immune.
                         
          REAL PEOPLE tighten up as they begin to catch on.

           While I wish I was here with better
           news, the reason you and I are
           meeting is this is your final week
           of employment here.
                         
          REAL PEOPLE blame all sorts of people and situations that
          they personally hold responsible.
                         
                          RYAN
           This is not a time to look for
           blame. Your position simply no
           longer exists.
                         
          REAL PEOPLE respond further. Some are enraged. Some are
          polite. One is even grateful.
                         
                          RYAN
           I understand why you are saying

                          RYAN
           No, that's why we love athletes.
           Kids love them because they follow

           Yeah, well I can't dunk.
                         
                          RYAN
           But you can cook.
                         
          Natalie looks to Ryan - Where is he going with this?
                         
                          BOB
           What are you talking about?
           44.
                         
                         
          Ryan picks up Bob's resume.
                         
                          RYAN
           Your resume says you minored in
           French Culinary Arts. Most students
           work the frier at KFC. You bussed
           tables at Il Picatorre to support
           yourself. Then you got out of
           college and started working here.
           (looks up at Bob)
           How much did they first pay you to
           give up on your dreams?
                         
                          BOB
                          (FLAT)
           Twenty seven thousand a year.
                         
                          RYAN
           At what point were you going to
           stop and go back to what made you
           happy?
                         
          Bob simply shrugs.
                         
                          RYAN
           Do you believe in fate, Bob?
                         
                          BOB
           Fate?
                         
                          RYAN
           Yeah. You know, the mysterious ways
           in which we wind up doing the
           things we were meant to do.
                         
                          BOB
                          (OFFERING)
           I met my wife at a gas station.
                         
                          RYAN
           Exactly. Well, I think fate is
           telling you to do something, Bob.
                         
          Bob looks up and meets eyes with Ryan.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           I see guys who work for the same
           company their entire lives. Clock
           in. Clock out. Never a moment of
           happiness.
           (pauses for effect)
           Not everyone gets this kind of
           opportunity.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           The chance for rebirth. If not for
           yourself... Do it for your kids.
                         
          Bob's eyes begin to water again. He's a changed man.
                         
          Ryan shoots Natalie a look - Hand over the packet.
                         
          Natalie jumps to attention and hands Bob a packet.
                         
                         
          INT. LOBBY, ST. LOUIS HILTON - NIGHT
                         
          There's a BUSINESS WOMAN waiting in the regular line. Ryan
          walks right past her and gets into the ELITE LINE. They are
          now both first in their respective lines for the counter.
                         
          The woman looks over at Ryan and sighs. Natalie holds back,
          confused by Ryan's actions and wanting to avoid confrontation.
                         
          The DESK CLERK frees up and gestures for Ryan to step
          forward. Ryan begins wheeling his bag forward. Meanwhile, the
          woman lifts her hand in outrage.
                         
                          BUSINESS WOMAN
           I've been waiting ten minutes. He just
           waltzes in and gets to cut in line.
                         
                          DESK CLERK
           We reserve priority assistance for
           our Hilton Honors members.
                         
          Ryan grabs a BROCHURE for ELITE MEMBERSHIP off the desk and
          hands it to the business woman.
                         
                          RYAN
           You should look into it - The
           promotions are great...
                         
          The woman bats it out of Ryan's hand onto the floor.
                         
                          BUSINESS WOMAN
           Fuck off.
                         
          Ryan looks back at the desk clerk and smiles. The desk clerk
          swipes his card.
                         
          Ryan's DIGITAL NUMBER bumps up another thousand points.
                         
                         
          INT. PUBLIC BATHROOM, ST. LOUIS HILTON - EVENING
                         
          Natalie is washing her hands, when she stops to look at
          herself in the mirror.
           46.
                         
                         
          After a beat, she hears someone CRYING in one of the stalls.
          She goes to see if the woman is okay, then stops herself -
          Maybe I fired her.
                         
          She grabs a paper towel, dries off her hands, and leaves.
                         
                         
          INT. RESTAURANT BAR, ST. LOUIS HILTON - EVENING
                         
          Natalie sits back down at the table a little visibly shaken.
                         
                          RYAN
           You okay?
                         
                          NATALIE
                          (COVERS QUICKLY)
           Yeah. Fine.
                         
          Just then, their food arrives... And there's a lot of food.
          Natalie's eyes move back and forth trying to figure out why
          there seems to be three main courses and a bunch of sides.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Hungry, much?
                         
                          RYAN
           Our expense account allots for forty
           dollars each on dinner. I plan on
           grabbing every mile I can.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Okay, you got to fill me in on this mile
           business. What's that all about? Are you
           talking like frequent flier miles?
                         
          Ryan gives Natalie a look - Is she ready for this information?
                         
                          RYAN
           Your really want to know?
                         
                          NATALIE
                          (MOCK SERIOUS)
           I'm dying to know.
                         
                          RYAN
           I don't spend a nickel, if I can help
           it, unless it somehow profits my
           mileage account. I'm not talking
           hotel rooms and rental cars either,
           but internet services, cell phone,
           music downloads, teleflorists. The
           works. I shop them according to the
           miles they pay and I pit them against
           each other for the most value.
           47.
                         
                         
                          NATALIE
           So, what are you saving up for?
           Hawaii? South of France?
                         
                          RYAN
           No, it's not like that... The miles
           are the goal.
                         
                          NATALIE
           That's it? You're saving to save?
                         
                          RYAN
           Let's just say I've got a number in
           mind and haven't hit it yet.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Wow. Seems a little abstract.
           What's your target?
                         
                          RYAN
           I'd rather not.
                         
                          NATALIE
                          (TEASING)
           It's a secret target?
                         
                          RYAN
           It's ten million miles.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Huh. Isn't ten million just a number?
                         
                          RYAN
           Pi is just a number.
                         
                          NATALIE
           I guess we all need a hobby.
                         
          Ryan looks back at Natalie - Hobby?
                         
                          NATALIE (CONT'D)
           Oh hey, I didn't mean to belittle your
           collection. I get it. Sounds cool.
                         
                          RYAN
           I'd be the seventh person to do it.
           More people have walked on the moon.

           Men get such a hard-on from putting

           don't grow up - You just need to

           If I had that many miles, I'd just
           show up at the airport, look up at
           one of those big destination
           boards, pick a place and go.
                         
          This idea sinks in for a second with both of them.
                         
                         
          INT. RYAN'S ROOM, ST. LOUIS HILTON - NIGHT
                         
          Ryan is laying in bed wearing a Hilton bathrobe. He's
          reviewing his sister's wedding invite when his BLACKBERRY
          BUZZES on the night stand. He reaches over to check it. It's
          a text message:
                         
          Alex: "Can't fall asleep."

          Alex is in a t-shirt, lying in bed. She types away at her
          BLACKBERRY and presses SEND.
                         
          Ryan's BLACKBERRY BUZZES again.
                         
          Alex: "You should rub one out."

          Ryan: "Only fair if you do too."
                         
          BLACKBERRY BUZZES again.

          Ryan smiles. He stares at the message for a second, then sets
          the blackberry down and turns off the light.

           No, I mean... why would your sister
           want a fake photo in front of the
           St. Louis Airport?

           She should be so lucky to visit Lambert
           Field. The Wright Brothers flew through
           there...
           (points out the conical
                          MAIN TERMINAL)
           The domed main terminal was the
           first of its kind. A precursor to
           everything from JFK to DeGualle.

           Look - Before Lindbergh could cross

           cousins, aunts, and uncles. Get
           your sisters and your brothers and

          Natalie and Ryan ride back to the airport. We catch them mid-
          conversation as Natalie drills Ryan on his theory.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Never...?
                         
          Ryan smiles to the few other riders as if apologizing.
                         
                          NATALIE (CONT'D)
           You never want to get married?
           Never want kids?
                         
                          RYAN
           Is that so bizarre?
                         
                          NATALIE
           Yes. Yes it is.
                         
                          RYAN
           I don't see the value.
                         
          Natalie sighs.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Sell it to me.
                         
                          NATALIE
           What?
                         
                          RYAN
           Sell me marriage.
                         
                          NATALIE
           I... Uh... How how about love?
                         
                          RYAN
           Pff...
           57.
                         
                         
                          NATALIE
           Okay. Stability?
                         
                          RYAN
           How many stabile marriages do you
           know?
                         
                          NATALIE
           Someone to talk to, spend your life
           with?
                         
                          RYAN
           I'm surrounded by people to talk
           to. I doubt that will change.
                         
          The shuttle stops and everyone goes to grab their bags.
                         
                         
          INT. LOBBY, MIAMI HILTON - DAY
                         
          Ryan and Natalie enter, still having the same conversation.
                         
                          NATALIE
           How about just not dying alone?
                         
          Ryan stops to address this.
                         
                          RYAN
           Starting when I was twelve, we
           moved each one of my grandparents
           into a nursing facility. My parents
           went the same way.
                          (A BEAT)
           Make no mistake. We all die alone.
                         
          Ryan turns, thinks of something, then turns back.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
                          (ADDING)
           Those cult members down in San
           Diego with the white sneakers and
           little Dixie cups of Kool-Aid. They
           didn't die alone.
                         
          Natalie looks steamed.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Just saying - There's options.
                         
          Out of nowhere, Natalie starts crying.
                         
                          RYAN
                          (ALMOST SILENT)
           Oh fuck.
           58.
                         
                         
          Natalie is now balling in the middle of the lobby.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Brian left me.
                         
                          RYAN
           Oh, hey... I...
                         
          Ryan goes to hug Natalie and she simply folds into his arms -
          A mop of tears. Ryan looks around for a place to set her
          down. Instead, he finds...
                         
          ALEX - Who gives a questioning look to the young sobbing girl.
                         
                          RYAN
           Hi. Alex this is Natalie. Natalie,
           this is my... friend, Alex.
                         
                          ALEX
           I should give you both a moment.
                         
          Natalie attempts a recovery. It's not graceful.
                         
                          NATALIE
           No, it's fine. I'm fine. Just
           stupid emotions.
                         
          Natalie gives Alex a firm handshake.
                         
                          ALEX
           Maybe a drink?
                         
          Ryan goes to challenge the idea, when...
                         
                          NATALIE
           Now we're talking.
                         
          Natalie leads the way. Alex and Ryan exchange quick hellos.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          THE SCREEN OF NATALIE'S CELL PHONE
                         
          TEXT READS: "I Think it's time we c other people"
                         
                         
          INT. BAR LOUNGE - MIAMI HILTON - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          The three share a booth. Natalie is sipping a drink. She seems
          to have settled a little.
           59.
                         
                         
                          ALEX
           He broke up with you over text
           message?
                         
                          RYAN
                          (SOFT DIG)
           That's kind of like firing people
           over the internet.
                         
          Both Natalie and Alex shoot Ryan a look.
                         
                          ALEX
           (re: the ex-boyfriend)
           What a weasely prick.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Yeah, but what does that make me?
           Someone who falls for a prick?
                         
                          ALEX
           We all fall for them. Pricks are
           spontaneous, unpredictable, and
           fun. And then we're surprised when
           they turn out to be pricks.
                         
                          NATALIE
           I followed him to Omaha.
                         
                          RYAN
           You did?
                         
                          NATALIE
           I had a job waiting for me in San
           Fran, when he got an offer from
           ConAgra. He told me we could start
           a life together. So I followed him.
                         
                          RYAN
           To Nebraska.
                         
                          NATALIE
           I look in the mirror and I just see
           compromise... I'm supposed to do
           something.
                         
                          ALEX
           You'll do plenty.
                         
                          NATALIE
           I just can't... I thought I'd be
           engaged by now.
                          (CATCHES HERSELF)
           No offense.
           60.
                         
                         
                          ALEX RYAN
          It's alright. None taken.
                         
                          NATALIE
           When I was sixteen, I thought by
           twenty three, I would be married,
           maybe have a kid... Corner office
           by day, entertaining at night. I
           was supposed to be driving a Grand
           Cherokee by now.
                         
                          ALEX
           Life can underwhelm you that way.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Now I have my sights on twenty
           nine, because thirty is just way
           too... apocalyptic. I mean, where
           did you think you'd be by...
                         
          Natalie catches herself, having no idea how old Alex is.
                         
                          ALEX
           It doesn't work that way.
                         
                          RYAN
           At a certain point, you stop with
           the deadlines.
                         
                          ALEX
           They can be a little counterproductive.
                         
                          NATALIE
           I don't want to say anything
           that's... anti-feminist. I mean, I
           really appreciate everything your
           generation did for me.
                         
                          ALEX
           (my generation?)
           It was our pleasure.
                         
                          RYAN
           Well done.
                         
                          NATALIE
           But sometimes it feels like no
           matter how much success I have, it
           all won't matter until I find the
           right guy.
                         
                          ALEX
           You really thought this guy was the one.
           61.
                         
                         
                          NATALIE
           Yeah, I guess. I don't know. I
           could have made it work. He just
           really fit the bill.
                         
                          RYAN
           The bill?
                         
                          NATALIE
           My type. You know, white collar.
           College grad. Loves dogs. Likes funny
           movies. Six foot one. Brown hair.
           Kind eyes. Works in finance but is
           Outdoorsy, you know, on the weekends.
           (we think she's done)
           I always imagined he'd have a
           single syllable name like Matt or
           John or... Dave. In a perfect
           world, he drives a Four Runner and
           the only thing he loves more than
           me is his golden lab. Oh... and a
           nice smile.
           (back to Alex and Ryan)
           How about you?
                         
          This catches both Alex and Ryan off guard.
                         
                          RYAN
           I'm not sure if...
                         
                          NATALIE
           I meant Alex...
                         
                          RYAN
           Right.
                         
                          ALEX
           Huh, let me think for a sec.
           (mulls it over)
           Well, by the time you're thirty four,
           all the physical requirements are
           pretty much out the window. I mean you
           secretly prey he'll be taller than you.
                         
          Ryan smiles.
                         
                          ALEX (CONT'D)
           Not an asshole would be nice? Just
           someone who enjoys my company. Comes
           from a good family - You don't think
           about that when you're younger.
                          (THINKING)
           Wants kids... Likes kids...

                          ALEX (CONT'D)
           Wants kids. Healthy enough to play
           catch with his future son one day.
                         
          We can tell Ryan is taking a serious interest in this.
                         
                          ALEX (CONT'D)
           Please let him earn more than I do.
           That doesn't make sense now, but
           believe me, it will one day. Otherwise
           it's just a recipe for disaster.
                          (REACHING)
           Hopefully some hair on his head...?
           But it's not exactly a deal-breaker
           anymore. Nice smile... Yep, a nice
           smile just might do it.
                         
          Alex looks to Ryan. He has a nice smile.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Wow. That was depressing.
                         
          Alex and Ryan react - It's not that bad.

           I should just date lesbians.
                         
                          ALEX
           Tried it. We're no picnic
           ourselves.
                         
          Natalie looks worse than when the conversation started.
                         
                          NATALIE
           I don't mind being married to my
           career, and I don't expect it to
           hold me in bed as I fall asleep.
                          (LOOKS UP)
           I just don't want to settle.
                         
                          ALEX
           You're young. Right now you see
           settling as some sort of failure.
                         
                          NATALIE
           It is. By definition.
                         
                          ALEX
           Don't worry, by the time someone is
           right for you, it won't feel like
           settling... And the only person
           left to judge you will be the
           twenty four year old girl with a
           target on your back.
           63.
                         
                         
          Natalie cracks a smile.
                         
          Ryan looks to Alex. They've grown closer.
                         
                         
          INT. LOBBY LOUNGE, MIAMI HILTON - DAY
                         
          Ryan, Alex, and Natalie wheel their ROLL-AWAYS towards the
          elevator.
                         
                          NATALIE
           So, what's the plan for this
           evening?
                         
          Ryan and Alex share an uncomfortable silence.
                         
                          NATALIE
           What...? Oh, is it illicit?
                         
                          RYAN
                          (QUICKLY)
           No...
                         
                          ALEX
           It's nothing like that.
                         
                          NATALIE
           We are in Miami.
                         
                          RYAN
           ... We were going to hit that party
           for the tech conference in the hotel.
                         
          Natalie notices a group of SOFTWARE TYPES mingling with
          badges around their necks.
                         
                          NATALIE
           I didn't know you could just attend
           those...
                         
                          ALEX
           Well, I mean...
                         
                          NATALIE
                          (EYES WIDEN)
           You're going to crash it?
                         
                          RYAN ALEX
          I mean, I don't know if... More money than they know
          These guy put on a quite a what to do with...
          party...
                         
                          NATALIE
           No, I get it. I'm in!
           64.
                         
                         
          INT. CONFERENCE CORRIDOR, MIAMI HILTON - NIGHT
                         
          Ryan, Alex, and Natalie confidently walk up to the CHECK-IN
          TABLE and take BADGES.
                         
          They turn the corner. Alex reads Natalie's badge.
                         
                          ALEX
           Jennifer Chu?
                         
                          NATALIE
           Oh shit!
                         
                          RYAN
           It's going to be fine.
                         
                         
          INT. SOFTWARE CONVENTION PARTY, MIAMI HILTON - NIGHT
                         
          Corporate color balloons. Lots of guys in LOGO POLOS. That
          great hip hop song from 1998 is playing over the PA.
                         
          We find Ryan, Alex, and Natalie at a stand up table. They're now
          wearing badges. Natalie is pretty tipsy at this point.
                         
                          RYAN
                          (TO NATALIE)
           You okay there?
                         
                          NATALIE
           Oh yeah... This was a great idea.
                          (TO ALEX)
           You are so pretty. You're exactly what
           I want to look like in fifteen years.
                         
                          ALEX
           Thank you, Natalie.
                         
          A CONFERENCE LEADER steps up to an on stage MIC.
                         
                          CONFERENCE LEADER
           How's everyone doing out there?!
                         
          People cheer. So do Ryan, Alex, and particularly Natalie.
                         
                          CONFERENCE LEADER
           I'm going to need you to all put
           your hands together for a very
           special guest - YOUNG... M... C!
                         
          The opening beats of the 90's jam "Bust-A-Move" blast over
          the speakers and sure enough, now-40-year-old rapper, Young
          MC steps out and starts rapping.
           65.
                         
                         
                          YOUNG MC
           THIS HERE'S A TALE FOR ALL THE
           FELLAS... TRY TO DO WHAT THOSE
           LADIES TELL US... GET SHOT DOWN
           CAUSE YOU'RE OVERZEALOUS... PLAY
           HARD TO GET, FEMALES GET JEALOUS...
                         
          Everyone goes crazy and starts dancing.
                         
          Ryan and Alex make it out to the dance floor. They're awful
          dancers, but they're having fun.
                         
                          RYAN
           Think she'll be okay?
                         
                          ALEX
           Look...
                         
          Natalie has already found a dancing partner, who can't
          believe his luck. She's all over him. Ryan smiles.
                         
                         
          EXT. BOAT - NIGHT
                         
          A nice two story yacht that was obviously purchased before
          the bubble popped. Inside the galley, a group is playing
          karaoke. NATALIE, wearing BADGES like Mardi Gras beads, is
          singing "Time After Time".
                         
          Meanwhile, near the back, Ryan and Alex sit with their legs
          hanging off the back of the hull.
                         
                          ALEX
           Back home, I don't get to act the way
           I do with you.
                         
                          RYAN
           That's why I don't have a "back home".
                         
                          ALEX
           I know. You're so cool. "Mr. Empty
           Back Pack".
                         
          Ryan emotionally stumbles.
                         
                          RYAN
           You know about the back pack?
                         
                          ALEX
           I googled you.
                         
                          RYAN
           You did?
           66.
                         
                         
                          ALEX
          It's what us modern girls do when
          we have a crush.
                         
                          RYAN
          Did it bother you?
                         
                          ALEX
          Well, that depends. Is the bag
          empty because you hate people or
          just the baggage they bring along?
                         
                          RYAN
          I don't hate people. I'm not
          exactly a hermit.
                         
                          ALEX
          You just don't want to be tied down?
          The whole responsibility thing.
                         
                          RYAN
          I don't think it's even that...
          I... First time I ever flew, I was
          sixteen.
                         
                          ALEX
          You're not going to answer? You're
          just going to tell me a story?
                         
                          RYAN
           (smiles, continues story)
          It was January and I had just
          gotten my driver's license. The
          lakes were frozen over, so we piled
          into my car and hit the ice to do
          donuts. When, out of nowhere, I hit
          a soft spot and the hood of my car
          tilted up and I was sinking
          backwards into the water.
                         
                          ALEX
          Jesus...
                         
                          RYAN
          I literally started to drown.
          Within a few seconds, I black out.
          Then, I wake up in the sky. I'm in a
          helicopter, laying on a stretcher.
          This guy in a uniform is telling me I
          was minutes away from dying.
                         
                          ALEX
          Oh my God.
           67.
                         
                         
                          RYAN
           Right?
           (relives it for a second)
           So just as we're hovering over the
           hospital, I sit up. And from there,
           I could see the whole western
           horizon. We'd been flying twenty
           minutes. Twenty minutes to reach a
           city I'd thought of as remote,
           halfway across the state... a
           foreign capital.
                          (A BEAT)
           My parents had taught me we lived
           in the best place on Earth, but now
           I could see the world was really
           just one place and comparing didn't
           make much sense. And I remember
           thinking - Don't tell me this isn't
           an age of miracles. Don't tell me
           we can't be everywhere at once.
                         
          The idea settles in. Ryan returns to the point.
                         
                          RYAN
           I don't know what originally
           sparked the back pack. I probably
           needed to be alone. Recently, I've
           been thinking that maybe I needed
           to empty the bag before I knew what
           to put back in.
                         
          And now they kiss. It's notably different from their previous
          kisses. Now, when they lock lips, we are reminded why people
          kiss in the first place.
                         
          Then, all of a sudden, the lights go out on the boat. The
          motor has stopped. Ryan and Alex look back to find the
          software dude stepping out of the galley, drunk.
                         
                          SOFTWARE DUDE
           Hey... I think we're out of gas.
                         
          Ryan and Alex look out to shore... about 500 yards away. For
          whatever reason, they just start cracking up.
                         
                         
          EXT. PONTOON BOAT - NIGHT
                         
          Ryan and Alex are huddled under a blanket in the corner of
          the rubber boat as it putters its way to shore.
                         
          Cold, soaked, and smiling.
                         
          Natalie and David are there too... still kissing.

          EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
                         
          Everyone gets out of the boat in the cold knee deep water and
          splashes up to shore.
                         
                         
          INT. LOBBY, MIAMI HILTON - NIGHT
                         
          Ryan and Alex followed by Natalie and her make-out buddy,
          soaked from the knee down, holding their shoes, scamper into
          the hotel on the balls of their feet.
                         
                         
          INT. RYAN'S HOTEL ROOM, MIAMI HILTON - NEXT MORNING
                         
          Ryan's eyes flutter awake to see Alex getting dressed.
                         
                          RYAN
           Hey, you're up...
                         
                          ALEX
           Got to fly stand-by and make a
           meeting in Milwaukee.
                         
                          RYAN
                          (DISAPPOINTED)
           Oh... Okay.
                         
                          ALEX
           (notices, teasing)
           Oh, no. I made you feel cheap.
                         
                          RYAN
           Yeah, all right... Just leave the
           money on the dresser.
                         
                          ALEX
                          (SWEETLY)
           I'll text you later so we can swap
           schedules.
                         
          Alex gives him a peck. Ryan takes her wrist so she can't leave.
                         
                          RYAN
           I can't remember the last time I
           enjoyed spending time with someone
           as much as you.
                         
                          ALEX
           Neither can I.
                         
          They kiss again and he lets go. Alex leaves and the door
          closes. Ryan just lays in bed for a moment.
           69.
                         
                         
          INT. CAFE - MIAMI HILTON - MORNING
                         
          Ryan and Natalie have a quiet breakfast. Natalie looks pretty
          worse for wear.
                         
          In the background is a TRAVELING SALESMAN rolling calls. He
          perks up for each message then goes back to being miserable.
                         
          Meanwhile, after a little silent eating...
                         
                          NATALIE
           Last night got a little out of
           hand. I said things... I don't
           remember everything I said. I just
           didn't want you to think...
                         
                          RYAN
           Just relax. It was nice to see you
           cut loose. So, did you wake him up
           or slip out?
                         
                          NATALIE
           What?
                         
                          RYAN
           This morning... Your new friend.
           Did you wake him for an awkward
           good bye or just slip out so he
           could feel like a whore.
                         
                          NATALIE
                          (NOT PROUD)
           I... just left.
                         
                          RYAN
           Protocol is always tricky.
                         
                          NATALIE
           I didn't know what was right.
                         
                          RYAN
           Sometimes there really is no right
           thing to do.
                         
          This doesn't comfort her.
                         
                         
          EXT. OCEAN BOARDWALK, MIAMI - DAY
                         
          The walkway overlooks a large MARINA filled with giant
          YACHTS. Ryan and Natalie are doing the photo thing with the
          CUT OUT of the engagement portrait again.
           70.
                         
                         
                          NATALIE
          What happened to Alex?
                         
                          RYAN
          Had to skip town early to make a
          meeting.
                         
                          NATALIE
          That's too bad. Where does she live?
                         
                          RYAN
          Chicago.
                         
                          NATALIE
          You thinking of going to see her?
                         
                          RYAN
          I don't know. We just don't have
          that kind of relationship.
                         
                          NATALIE
          What kind of relationship do you
          have?
                         
                          RYAN
          It's, you know. Casual.
                         
                          NATALIE
          Sounds pretty special.
                         
                          RYAN
          It works for us.
                         
                          NATALIE
          Think there's any future there?
                         
                          RYAN
          Never thought about it. What's
          going on here?
                         
                          NATALIE
          Really never thought about it?
                         
                          RYAN
           (a good lie)
          No.
                         
                          NATALIE
          How can you not think about these
          things? How does it not even cross
          your mind that you might want to
          have a future with somebody?
           71.
                         
                         
                          RYAN
           It's simple, you know that moment
           when you look into someone's eyes
           and you feel them looking right
           into your soul, and the whole world
           goes quiet for a second.
                         
                          NATALIE
           (finally, a break through)
           Yes.
                         
                          RYAN
           Right. Well, I don't.
                         
                          NATALIE
           You're an asshole.
                         
          Natalie knocks over the CUT OUT and stands up.
                         
                          RYAN
           Oh come on, I'm just dicking
           around. I need your help...
                         
                          NATALIE
           Don't you think it's worth giving
           her a chance?
                         
                          RYAN
           A chance to what?
                         
                          NATALIE
           A chance at something real?
                         
                          RYAN
           Natalie, your definition of "real"
           is going to evolve as you get
           older...
                         
                          NATALIE
           Would you stop condescending for
           one second? Or is that one of the
           principles of your bullshit
           philosophy?
                         
                          RYAN
           Bullshit philosophy?
                         
                          NATALIE
           The isolation? The traveling? Is
           that supposed to be charming?
                         
                          RYAN
           No, it's simply a life choice.
           72.
                         
                         
                          NATALIE
           It's a cocoon of self-banishment.
                         
                          RYAN
           Wow. Big words.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Screw you.
                         
                          RYAN
           Well, screw you too.
                         
                          NATALIE
           You've set up a way of life that
           basically makes it impossible for
           you to make any human connections.
           Now, somehow, this woman runs the
           gauntlet of your ridiculous "life
           choice" and comes out the other end
           with a smile - Just so you can call
           her casual. Jesus. I need to grow
           up? You're a twelve year old.
                         
          Natalie begins walking away.
                         
                          RYAN
           I don't have a gauntlet of...
                         
          A GUST OF WIND suddenly blows the CUTOUT across the boardwalk
          into the OCEAN.
                         
                          RYAN
           ... Fuck!
                         
          Ryan goes running after the cutout. He climbs down a GANGWAY
          to a dock that is closest to the CUTOUT, which is beginning
          to sink in the filthy water.
                         
          Ryan reaches... and reaches... and just as he's got a finger
          tip on the photo... FALLS IN.
                         
                         
          INT. BATHROOM, MIAMI HILTON - DAY
                         
          Ryan, still damp from the ocean, is drying the CUTOUT with a
          hair dryer.
                         
                         
          INT. CONCOURSE, MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY
                         
          We're following the CUTOUT HEADS popping out of the ROLL-AWAY
          like earlier, only now they are slightly faded and bent from
          their trip in the harbor.
           73.
                         
                         
                         
                         
          EXT. TARMAC, MIAMI INTERNATIONAL - DAY
                         
          We're watching Ryan through the window of the plane. He
          almost looks trapped.
                         
                         
          EXT. TARMAC, DETROIT INTERATIONAL - DAY
                         
          The plane lands amidst snow.
                         
                         
          INT. RENTAL CAR, DETROIT HIGHWAY - DAY
                         
          Ryan and Natalie drive in silence. The weather is frigid.
                         
                          RYAN
           These Detroit guys can be tough.
           They've been getting hammered. Don't
           get distracted. Stick to the simple
           stuff. Get the packet in their hands
           and get them out the door.
                         
                         
          EXT. DETROIT CAR PART COMPANY - DAY
                         
          A one story brick building. There's an inch of snow on the
          ground. Ryan and Natalie enter the building in silence.
                         
                         
          INT. DETROIT COMPANY - DAY
                         
          Ryan and Natalie check in at the front desk.
                         
                         
          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, DETROIT COMPANY - DAY
                         
          The door opens. Ryan and Natalie enter, when they both see
          something and immediately stop short.
                         
          Sitting on the conference table is a COMPUTER set up for a
          VIDEO CONFERENCE.
                         
          Framed up in a WINDOW on the screen is CRAIG GREGORY.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Welcome to Detroit.
                         
          Natalie and Ryan exchange a look.
                         
                          RYAN
           What's going on here?
           74.
                         
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           I've been getting those great
           numbers over the last few days.
           Thought we should nut up and give
           this a try.
                         
                          RYAN
           We could use a little more time.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Gotta leave the nest at some point.
                         
                          RYAN
           This is a real company, Craig.
           We're here to do some damage.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           I know. Good thing we brought our
           best. So let's stop screwing
           around, alright?
                         
                         
          Ryan sighs.
                         
                          RYAN
           Just give me a minute to prepare
           and get my things together.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           I was thinking Natalie takes this one.
                         
          Natalie, once confident, now takes pause.
                         
                          RYAN
           She's hardly ready for this.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           I've been watching her. She's great.
                         
                          RYAN
           (re: the webcam)
           This is a whole other animal...
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           I mean, she created it. Natalie,
           you not up for it?
                         
                          NATALIE
           I'm... I'm game.

          Ryan and Natalie have a moment aside.
                         
                          RYAN
           Just remember, don't apologize.
           Don't tell them how hard this is
           for you. Today is one of the worst
           days they will ever have. What we
           feel doesn't even compare.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Got it.
                         
                          RYAN
           Just keep it professional. You're
           going to do fine.
                         
                         
          INT. CRAIG GREGORY'S OFFICE, CTC - LATER
                         
          Craig is leaning back in his office chair, watching Natalie
          on his monitor.
                         
                         
          INT. ALTERNATE CONFERENCE ROOM, DETROIT COMPANY - DAY
                         
          An unsuspecting man in his mid fifties enters the room and
          takes a seat at a COMPUTER TERMINAL.
                         
          (for the remainder of the scene, we will intercut between
          Natalie's room and the POV of the man's iChat session.)
                         
                          NATALIE
           Hello, Mr. Samuels. My name is
           Natalie Keener.
                         
                          SAMUELS
           (checking out the PC)
           What's going on here?
                         
                          NATALIE
           I wish I was here with better news,
           however your position here at
           Deckers is no longer available.
                         
                          SAMUELS
           What are you talking about?
                         
                          NATALIE
           You've been let go.
           76.
                         
                         
                          SAMUELS
           What, just like that? I can't
           believe... Who are you?
                         
                          NATALIE
           My name is Miss Keener. I am here
           to tell you about your options...
                         
                          SAMUELS
           I work here for seventeen years and
           they send some fourth grader in here
           to can me? What the fuck is this?!
                         
          Ryan fights the urge to jump in. He is sitting next to
          Natalie, but just out of view of the camera.
                         
                          NATALIE
           It's perfectly normal to be upset.
           However, the sooner you can tell
           yourself that there are greater
           opportunities waiting for you...
                         
                          SAMUELS
           Greater opportunities? I'm fifty-
           seven-fucking years old!
                         
          Mr. Samuels is now on the verge of tears. Eyes red.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Anybody who ever built an empire,
           or changed the world, sat where you
           are now. And it's because they sat
           there that they were able to do it.
                         
          We remain in the room with Natalie and Ryan, but we hear Mr.
          Samuels crying. It's loud and embarrassing. It's coming from
          the next room. He's literally on the other side of the wall.
                         
                          NATALIE (CONT'D)
           There's a packet in front of you.
                         
          Samuels picks up the packet and opens it.
                         
                          NATALIE (CONT'D)
           I want you to take some time and
           review it.
                         
          Samuels begins to leaf through.

           The sooner you trust the process,
           the sooner your next step in life
           will unveil itself.
                         
          Samuels puts down the packet. The tears still coming slowly.
                         
                          NATALIE (CONT'D)
           I need you to return to your office
           now and begin to put together your
           personal things.
                         
          Samuels doesn't move. He's just sitting there in a daze.
                         
                          NATALIE (CONT'D)
           Thank you for your time, Mr. Samuels.
                         
          No reaction. Just more silent tears. Natalie is getting nervous.
                         
                          NATALIE (CONT'D)
           Mr. Samuels? There's nothing else
           we can discuss now.
                          (AND AGAIN)
           Thank you for your time.
                         
          Ryan fights the urge to break in as Natalie continues to lose
          her composure.
                         
          Craig leans into his computer, watching intently.
                         
                          NATALIE (CONT'D)
           Mr. Samuels... Mr. Samuels.... MR.
           SAMUELS...
                         
          Finally, Samuels breaks from his daze. He looks up and around
          for a second, then gets up and leaves.
                         
          Natalie catches her breath. A second later, Samuels passes
          their room, visible through the conference room windows. They
          watch as he walks away.
                         
                          RYAN
           You did good.
                         
          Natalie nods.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           You okay? Want me to take over.
                         
                          NATALIE
           No, I'm alright.
                         
          Natalie pulls out a LIST OF FORTY NAMES. The amount of people
          is daunting. She crosses off the first name.

          EXT. PARKING LOT, DETROIT CAR PART COMPANY - AFTERNOON
                         
          We find Natalie standing next to the rental car. She's staring
          into a snow drift. Her eyes say everything - She just grew up.
                         
          Meanwhile, Ryan is on his CELL. We catch the end of his
          conversation with Craig.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           ... We just got out here. That was
           one place. I think we need to try a
           few more...
                          (LISTENS)
           Maybe there isn't a difference, but
           it's comforting to know we're in
           the next room.
                          (LISTENING)
           I know you don't give a shit about
           my comfort.
                          (LISTENS)
           We could just use a little more
           time. That's all I'm saying.
                          (LISTENS)
           Right... Right.
           (shakes his head)
           Yeah... Alright... Uh huh. Bye.
                         
          Ryan hangs up.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           He thought you did a great job. You
           did - I was real proud of you.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Thanks.
                         
                          RYAN
           We're being pulled off the road.
                          (CLARIFYING)
           We're going home.
                         
                          NATALIE
           For good?
                         
                          RYAN
           That's what it looks like.
                         
          A moment of mixed emotions.
                         
                         
          INT. RYAN'S ROOM, DETROIT HILTON - NIGHT
                         
          Ryan is holding the LARGE EMBOSSED ENVELOPE of his sister's
          WEDDING INVITATION.
           79.
                         
                         
          He pulls out the RESPONSE CARD, looks at the line for extra
          guests, then sets it down. He pulls out the actual
          INVITATION. It looks inexpensive. Sighs.
                         
                         
          INT. NORTH TERMINAL, DETROIT AIRPORT - MORNING
                         
          Ryan and Natalie ride the MOVING WALKWAY. Something is on
          Natalie's mind. She speaks up.
                         
                          NATALIE
           I'm sorry about what I said about
           Alex. I was out of line.
                         
                          RYAN
           It's alright. I understand.
                         
                          NATALIE
           I mean, who am I to be dolling out
           relationship advice?
                         
                          RYAN
           It's fine.
                         
                          NATALIE
           You going to be okay?
                         
                          RYAN
           What do you mean?
                         
                          NATALIE
           In Omaha?
                         
                          RYAN
           Oh, I don't know.
                         
                          NATALIE
           It's better than you'd think.
                         
          They get off the moving walkway and stop at a GATE that reads
          "Omaha". Something off screen grabs Ryan's attention.
                         
          Ryan begins to walk off. Pulls out his BLACKBERRY and dials.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Ryan, where are you going?
                         
                          RYAN
           Grabbing another flight... Something
           I need to take care of. I'll see you
           in, uh... at home.
                         
          Ryan disappears in the crowd.

           Okay, start walking it in from the left.
                         
          ALEX enters frame, carrying the engagement CUT OUT.
                         
                          ALEX
           I have to admit, when you asked me to
           meet you in Vegas... I thought we'd
           gamble, make out in a heart shaped
           jacuzzi, maybe see one of those weird
           French Canadian circus shows.
                         
                          RYAN
           There'll be plenty of time for all that.

           One more foot to the left.
                         
          Alex obliges. She checks out the engagement photo.
                         
                          ALEX
           How do you feel about the wedding?

           I'm fine, I guess.

           Okay great... walk away.
                         
          Ryan takes the photo.
                         
          Alex picks up the engagement photo.
                         
                          ALEX
           They're a cute couple.

           Yeah, they'll make cute kids. If they're
           lucky, maybe look a little like you.
                         
          Alex and Ryan look at the photo together for a second.

                          ALEX (CONT'D)
           I like it if you're there. Besides, I
           know a killer burger in Milwaukee.

           What are you doing this weekend?
                         
          This quickly registers... He's inviting me to the wedding.
                         
                          ALEX (CONT'D)
           No...
                         
                          RYAN
           What? I haven't even...
                         
                          ALEX
           I can't.
                         
                          RYAN
           Why not?
                         
                          ALEX
           I couldn't.
                         
                          RYAN
           I'm being serious.
                         
                          ALEX
           You want me to be your date?
                         
                          RYAN
           Well... Yeah.
                         
                          ALEX
           To a wedding... Jesus, Ryan. Your
           sister's wedding?
                         
                          RYAN
           It's not like I know her that well.
                         
                          ALEX
           I'm just not sure if it's
           appropriate for me to...
                         
                          RYAN
           Look. You know. I'm not the wedding
           type. But for the first time in my
           life... I don't want to be that
           guy, alone with his drink. I want a
           dancing partner. I want a plus one.
           And if you can stomach it, I'd like
           it to be you.

          A long thoughtful beat. Alex sighs.
                         
                          ALEX
           Okay.
                         
                          RYAN
           Really?
                         
                          ALEX
           Yeah, I can't believe I... Yeah,
           I'm in. When is it?
                         
                          RYAN
           I feel like we should kiss or
           something.
                         
                          ALEX
           Then kiss me.
                         
          They do.
                         
                         
          INT. BAGGAGE CAROUSEL, MILWAUKEE AIRPORT - DAY
                         
          Two ROLL-AWAYS side-by-side, moving through the terminal.
                         
          Ryan and Alex walk in unison. They share a smile. Almost like
          they can't believe they're getting away with something.
                         
          They pass a LARGE AIRLINE ADVERTISEMENT featuring MAYNARD
          FINCH in uniform. "We Value Your Loyalty."
                         
                         
          EXT. DRIVEWAY, CHALET SUITES - DAY
                         
          Ryan's rental car pulls into the CHALET SUITES driveway. It's
          halfway between a Swiss Lodge and a Best Western. Just a
          little sadder. A yellow sign reads "Welcome Miller-Bingham
          Wedding Guests!"
                         
                         
          INT. LOBBY, CHALET SUITES HOTEL - DAY
                         
          Ryan and Alex approach the check-in lines. Of course, there's
          an elite membership line, but they can't use it.
                         
          Ryan is forced to stand in a queue of three people while a
          CHECK-IN LADY just stands at her computer at the elite line.
                         
                          RYAN
           (to the CHECK-IN LADY)
           Are you available?
           83.
                         
                         
                          CHECK-IN LADY
           Sorry, this line is for members of
           our Matterhorn program.
                         
          Ryan steams.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, CHALET SUITES - DAY
                         
          Ryan and Alex walk down the long hallway. They've been given
          a room at the end. Just as they're entering their room, the
          door across the hall opens revealing a woman in her early
          forties with a basket of laundry. It's Ryan's sister KARA.
                         
                          KARA
           Ryan?
                         
          Ryan turns and stops. It's been a while...
                         
                          RYAN
           Kara...
                         
          They hug. It's a strange hug. Awkward but heartfelt.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Alex, this is my sister Kara.
                         
                          KARA
           Well, hello.
                         
                          ALEX
           Hi.
                         
                          KARA
           (quite frankly...)
           Ryan has told me nothing about you.
                         
                          RYAN
           Kara, what are you doing at a hotel?
                         
                          KARA
           Fuck, I was hoping I wouldn't have
           to... Yeah, uh, Frank and I are
           trying out a trial separation.
                         
                          RYAN
           You're not staying at the house?
                         
                          KARA
           There was an extra room on hold
           here, so I just took it for the
           weekend.
           84.
                         
                         
                          RYAN
           Oh, okay.
                         
                          KARA
           Yup. So, you guys are dating?
                         
          Ryan and Alex fumble over each other.
                         
                          RYAN
           Um...
                         
                          ALEX
           It's not exactly...
                         
                          KARA
           Hey, don't worry about it. We're
           all getting a little old to be
           calling someone girlfriend... I
           remember when mom used to call Jack
           her boyfriend. It drove me up the
           wall. Boyfriends are for kids...
                          (MOCK ANNOUNCING)
           And I'm just a divorcee!
                         
          An awkward beat in the corridor of the Chalet Suites.
                         
                          RYAN
           So, the rehearsal dinner?
                         
                          KARA
           Yeah, I'll see you two there.
                         
          Kara humps the laundry basket down the hall.
                         
                         
          INT. HOTEL ROOM, CHALET SUITES - DAY
                         
          Ryan and Alex settle in. There's a cheap basket with a pink
          ribbon tied sloppily around some cellophane. In the basket is
          a packet, outlining the wedding weekend.
                         
                          RYAN
           There's a packet.
                         
                          ALEX
           What in life is worth doing that
           doesn't have a packet.
                         
                          RYAN
           Um, I love you?
                         
          Ryan is kidding, but not really. They play it off as a joke,
          but can't help feel the weight of this "moment".
           85.
                         
                         
          INT. CLUB ROOM FIRESIDE LOUNGE, CHALET SUITES - EVENING
                         
          A group of tables have been slid together for the rehearsal
          dinner. Ryan and Alex find the dinner in full swing.
                         
          Ryan's sister JULIE, the bride, waves wildly.
                         
                          JULIE
           Oh my God, Ryan!
                         
          She hops up and gives him a hug.
                         
                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           You must be Alex. You are so
           beautiful. Kara was right. Did you
           get the basket?
                         
                          ALEX
           The basket was very lovely.
                         
                          JULIE
           Tammy wrapped all of them.
                         
          Tammy waves.
                         
                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           Ryan, you look so grown up.
                         
                          RYAN
           Me? You're the one getting married.
                         
                          JULIE
           I know, right? You haven't even
           seen my ring.
                         
          Julie shows off her ring. It's not quite balanced and seems
          to favor quantity over quality.
                         
                          JULIE (CONT'D)
                          (PROUDLY)
           Jim designed it.
                         
          JIM raises a hand. This is Julie's husband-to-be and we can
          tell immediately that Ryan isn't thrilled.
                         
          Ryan thinks of something. He pulls out the 5X7 PHOTOS they
          took of the JIM & JULIE CUT OUT.
                         
                          RYAN
           I brought those photos you were
           asking for...
           86.
                         
                         
                          JULIE
                          (LIGHTS UP)
           Oh great! They go over there.
                         
          Julie points to a table and Ryan walks over. When he gets there,
          we see almost a hundred photos pinned to a map of America. It's
          overwhelming. All of a sudden, his effort seems miniscule.
                         
          Ryan begins to pin his photos on the map over the cities
          where they were taken. He backs away to see it as a whole and
          his addition has already become invisible.
                         
          Ryan returns to the conversation with his sister and Alex.
                         
                          RYAN
           There were quite a few already up
           there. Almost couldn't find room.
                         
                          JULIE
           I know, isn't it great how everyone
           chipped in?
                         
                          RYAN
           What gave you the idea to do
           something so...
                         
                          ALEX
                          (HELPS)
           ... Substantial?
                         
                          JULIE
           Well, Jim has a lot of our nest egg
           invested in this real estate
           venture right now. So when we went
           over our finances, a honeymoon just
           didn't seem affordable this
           second... So I thought... Hey, just
           because we can't travel doesn't
           mean we can't have pictures.
                         
          The idea of this lands on Ryan pretty hard.
                         
                          ALEX
           It was a great idea.
                         
                          JULIE
           Thanks.

          AN HOUR LATER
                         
          Ryan is stuck with Jim, talking real estate. Alex is having a
          chat with the brides maids about local relationship drama.

           It's sixty acres up against the
           foothills. I subdivided the old
           Lazy W Ranch and took a nice slice
           for myself.

           Sounds nice.
                         
          Jim makes an exhale noise that means "you bet your ass".

                          RYAN
           Must be a nice development.
                         
                          JIM
                          (CORRECTING)
           It's a community, not a development.
           The concept is turn-key everything.
           You buy a maintenance contract with
           the home. We'll whack your weeds,
           we'll even change the light bulb.
           Furniture? You buy your own or choose
           a package. Seamless traditionalism,
           yet all the perks.
                         
                          RYAN
           Nice.
                         
          Ryan and Alex make eye contact. There's a joy in their
          connection amongst the ramblings of their company.
                         
                          JIM
           We all need a place to call our
           own. This is America. This is what
           we were promised.
                         
                          RYAN
           That's a nice touch.
                         
                          JIM
           What?
                         
                          RYAN
           That bit at the end about
           promise... I like it.

           Thanks.

           So, you still renting that one-
           bedroom?
                         
                          RYAN
           I gave it up.

                          (SURPRISED)
           You own now?
                         
                          RYAN
           No.
                         
                          JIM

           Not really. No.
                         
          The conversation stalls out.

          Everyone is leaving. Tammy grabs Julie's hands.
                         
                          TAMMY
           Can you believe it's tomorrow?! How
           are you going to sleep?
                         
                          JULIE
           I don't know!
                         
                          TAMMY
           You want some Xanax?
                         
                          RYAN
           I don't think that's for sleeping.
                         
                          JULIE
           No, I'm good. I'll have some warm
           milk. That should do the trick.
                         
          Jim comes walking by with a box of flower arrangements from
          the tables inside that are going to be reused at the wedding.

                          RYAN
           You sure?
                         
                          ALEX
           Yeah, yeah...
                         
          Alex steps back in and for the first time in who knows how
          many years, Ryan, Kara, and Julie are alone together.
                         
                          RYAN
           Jim seems like a good guy.
                         
                          JULIE
           Yeah, I know... Isn't he great?
                         
                          KARA
           He's going to make a great husband.
                         
          There's a moment where they just look at each other and
          giggle a little. Just the three of them.
                         
                          RYAN
           Hey, Julie, I was thinking... with
           dad not being... Well, I didn't
           know if you had someone to walk you
           down the aisle...
                         
                          JULIE
           Oh, yeah, Jim's uncle is going to
           do it.
                         
                          KARA
                          (UNCOMFORTABLE)
           He's been really supportive.
                         
                          RYAN
           Oh... Oh, great. Just wanted to
           make sure you were covered. So I
           should get there at...

           Guests are arriving around 5ish.
           Things get going at 530. So you
           know, around then. It's easy. Just
           come down the elevator.
                         
          Alex comes out with the second box. Ryan notices and grabs the
          flowers from her and sets them in Jim's luxury pick-up truck.

          cards slide in simultaneously. Alex heads in. Ryan stops.
                         
                          RYAN
           Hey Kara?

           Yeah.
                         
                          RYAN
           Can you believe she's getting
           married already? She's just a kid.
                         
                          KARA
           No Ryan. Actually, she's 37 years
           old. She's barely squeaking by.

          The rental car pulls up into the empty lot. Snow on the
          ground. It's cold.
                         
          Ryan and Alex walk up the steps and try the door of the main
          building - it's locked. Ryan shrugs.
                         
                          ALEX
           That's all you got?
                         
          Alex starts walking down the side of the building, looking
          for an open window. The third one opens a crack. She slides
          her HOTEL HONORS CARD in and opens the latch.
                         
                          RYAN

          climbs in after her. He immediately recognizes his

          Ryan immediately spots Julie sobbing and being consoled by
          her bride's maids. The groomsmen are huddled in another
          corner, embarrassed and confused. Kara splits from the brides
          maids and takes Ryan aside.
                         
                          RYAN
           What happened?
                         
                          KARA
           Jim's got cold feet.
                         
                          RYAN
           Today?
                         
                          KARA
           That's how cold feet work.
                         
                          RYAN
           What do you want me to do?
                         
                          KARA
           Talk to him.
                         
                          RYAN
           You want me to talk to him?

                          KARA
           Hey, it's either you or me. You know my
           record. I've already struck out once.
                         
                          RYAN
           I haven't been to bat. I haven't
           been in the dugout.
                         
                          KARA
           Don't you talk for a living?
           Motivational type stuff?
                         
                          RYAN

                          RYAN
           It's a philosophy.
                         
                          KARA
           It's stupid.
                         
                          RYAN
           Hey, it might have helped you.
                         
          A beat of stalemate.
                         
                          KARA
           Come on, Ryan. You haven't been
           around much. Fuck, you basically
           don't exist to us. I know you want
           to be there for her... Well here it
           is. This is your chance.
                         
          Ryan takes a breath.
                         
                         
          INT. SUNDAY SCHOOL ROOM, CHURCH - DAY
                         
          Ryan quietly steps in to find Jim, half dressed in a tux
          reading the children's book "The Velveteen Rabbit". Jim
          sniffles. Ryan goes to leave, when...
                         
                          JIM
           Ryan?
                         
                          RYAN
           Oh, hey Jim.

                          RYAN
           Yeah, it's pretty powerful stuff.
                         
                          JIM
           I'll say.
                         
                          RYAN
           Kara mentioned you were having
           some... thoughts?
                         
          Jim puts down the book.
                         
                          JIM
           I don't think I can do this.
                         
                          RYAN
           Okay. What makes you say that today?
                         
                          JIM
           I was just laying there last night
           in bed and I couldn't sleep. I was
           thinking about the wedding and the
           ceremony and all. Us buying a house
           and moving in together. Having a
           kid... Having another kid...
           (begins to snowball)
           ... Thanksgiving, Christmas, spring
           break, football games, all of a sudden
           they're out of school, getting jobs,
           getting married, And then, you know...
           I'm a grandparent. I'm retired. Before
           you know it - I'm dead... and I just
           kept thinking... "What's the point?"
                         
          Ryan gulps. Fuck.
                         
                          JIM (CONT'D)
           (now asking Ryan directly)
           I mean what is the point?
                         
                          RYAN
           The point?
                         
                          JIM
           Yeah, I mean, what am I starting here?
                         
                          RYAN
                          (DANCING)
           It's marriage... it's the most
           beautiful thing on Earth... you
           know, what everyone aspires to...
           96.
                         
                         
                          JIM
           You never got married.
                         
                          RYAN
           That's true...
                         
                          JIM
           You never even tried.
                         
                          RYAN
           Well, it's hard to define "try".
                         
                          JIM
           You seem happier than most of my
           married friends.
                         
          Ryan takes a beat.
                         
                          RYAN
           Jim, I'm not going to lie. Marriage
           can be a pain in the ass. And
           you're kind of right - All of this
           is just stuff on the way to your
           eventual demise.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           We are all on running clocks that
           cannot be slowed down or paused and
           they all lead to the same place.
           Some guys leave marks that last
           beyond their own mortality. Not guys
           like you and me... But some. But
           even those footprints disappear.
                          (A BEAT)
           There isn't a "point".
                         
          Jim sinks a little.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           I'm not the guy you'd normally want
           to talk to about all this stuff...
           But think about it - your favorite
           memories. The greatest moments of
           your life? Were you alone?

                          RYAN
           I don't want to sound like a
           Hallmark card, but... Life? It's
           better with company.
                         
          Jim nods.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Come to think of it... Last night,
           the night before your wedding, when
           all this shit was circling through
           your head... Weren't you two
           sleeping in separate rooms?
                         
                          JIM
           Yeah, Julie went back to the
           apartment and I was all alone in
           that big honeymoon suite...
                         
          Jim chuckles to himself.
                         
                          RYAN
           Kind of lonely?

           Yeah.
                         
                          RYAN
           Hey. Everybody needs a copilot.
                         
          This resonates with Jim and he can't help but smile.
                         
                          JIM
           That's a nice touch.

          Jim walks over to the huddle of bride's maids. They part and
          let him in. He kneels at Julie's feet...
                         
                          JIM
           I'm sorry I'm such a fuck up...
           Will you be my co-pilot?
                         
          Julie gives him a perplexed look before smiling and falling
          into his arms. Tears and smiles spread amongst the girls.
                         
          Kara walks over to Ryan and pats him on the shoulder.
                         
                          KARA
           Welcome home.
                         
          MONTAGE BEGINS AS A SERIES OF IMAGES:
                         
          - Ryan and Alex getting dressed in a little kitchen in the
          church. They're in a hurry and a little sloppy, but there's a

          - Jim standing at the alter with the priest getting a pat on

          - The band does a cheesy choreographed dance step.
                         
          - Jim makes a speech. He is not good at public speaking, but
          the guests are generous with laughter.

          - Ryan and Alex get into the elevator together. She's wearing
          his jacket. We're about to see them kiss, when the elevator
          door closes.

           Same guy. Just one address.
                         
          We hear a boarding announcement for Chicago. Alex begins to
          step away to her gate.
                         
                          ALEX
           Call me if you get lonely.
                         
          A beat. And then...
                         
                          RYAN
           ... I'm lonely.
                         
          Alex turns for her gate and joins the crowd. Ryan goes to say
          something. He has an impulse... but he finally ignores it and
          gets in line under the sign that reads "OMAHA".
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. RYAN'S APARTMENT, OMAHA - EARLY EVENING
                         
          The door opens and Ryan wheels in his Roll-Away. He walks over
          to the window, parts the blinds and checks out his awful view.
           100.
                         
                         
          We see Ryan opening some mail. We see Ryan laying in bed.
                         
          It's quiet. It's alone.
                         
                         
          INT. CTC HEADQUARTERS, CTC - DAY
                         
          Natalie is giving Ryan a tour of the new ONLINE FIRING AREA -
          A series of cubicles with YOUNG GUYS ON HEADSETS. She is in
          her element and very proud of her work.
                         
                          NATALIE
           ... Some guy sits down in a
           conference room somewhere and a
           server routes their session to one
           of our termination engineers.
                         
                          RYAN
           You don't actually call them that.
                         
                          NATALIE
           I prefer "terminators", but it
           bumped with legal.
                         
                          RYAN
           Really? I can't imagine why.
                         
                          NATALIE
           They follow a workflow that can take
           them through anything from a standard
           dismissal to a violent aggressor.
                         
                          RYAN
           Are they actually on line, right now?
                         
                          NATALIE
           No, they're beta-testing. Role-playing.
           We go live at the end of the month.
           (catches one of the guys
           making a mistake)
           Kyle, you're running through the
           events too quickly. You have to give
           them time to acknowledge each
           statement. Okay? It's a legal thing.
                         
          Ryan can only watch.
                         
                         
          INT. RYAN'S OFFICE, CTC - DAY
                         
          Ryan is sitting at his desk. He puts on a HEADSET.
                         
                          RYAN
           This is ridiculous.

          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, CTC - ANOTHER DAY
                         
          Craig is leading a meeting. Ryan seems focused on something
          on his laptop. We see his screen: An itinerary for GoalQuest.
                         
                         
          EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP - DAY
                         
          One of the GIANT DIGITAL MARQUEES reads: "GOALQUEST XX"
                         
                         
          INT. GREEN ROOM, GOALQUEST - DAY
                         
          Ryan sits on a sofa, holding his BACKPACK. A slick GOALQUEST
          HOST enters the room.
                         
                          GOALQUEST HOST
           You ready to rock?
                         
          Ryan nods and gets up.
                         
                         
          INT. CONVENTION HALL, LAS VEGAS - DAY
                         
          Ryan stands in the wings. He takes a breath, then steps out
          in front of a sea of people.
                         
          The GOALQUEST XX stage is like nothing we've seen yet. Large
          and professional. Blue Banners hang from the ceiling. Digital
          projectors show Ryan's Headshot - What's In Your Backpack?
                         
          Ryan sets the BACK PACK on a table and quickly unzips it.
                         
          A breath.
                         
                          RYAN
           Last year, I flew three hundred
           fifty thousand miles. The moon is
           only two fifty.
                         
          A long beat. Uncomfortable. Ryan looks at the back pack.
                         
                          RYAN
           Imagine for a second that you're
           carrying a backpack... I want you
           to feel the straps on your
           shoulders... You feel them?
                         
          Ryan isn't feeling them. He is not inspired. He isn't
          believable. He's barely even there.
           102.
                         
                         
                          RYAN
           Now, I want you to pack it with all
           the stuff you have in your life.
           Start with the little things.
                         
          Ryan is trying, but he can't find the will to do this.
                         
                          RYAN
           The... um... The stuff in drawers
           and on shelves.
                         
          Ryan takes a beat. He just stares at the backpack and thinks
          about all the things he has removed from it... And then...
                         
                          RYAN
           Excuse me.
                         
          And with that, Ryan leaves the stage. Handlers try to figure
          out what Ryan is doing. The Host runs for the mic.
                         
                          GOALQUEST HOST
                          (TO RYAN)
           What the fuck are you doing?
                          (TO CROWD)
           Okay, everyone just relax. We'll
           have your next guest out in a sec.

          INT. BOEING 757 - NIGHT
                         
          Over Ryan's shoulder, through the window, we see Chicago
          below as the flight begins its descent.

          Ryan on the PEOPLE MOVER under the ceiling of NEON LIGHTS.
          Peaceful music emits from hidden speakers. Ryan walks briskly
          past idle riders.

          Ryan hurriedly signs a hand-held device, hops into a SEDAN
          and speeds off. The RENTAL CAR ASSISTANT suddenly realizes...
                         
           RENTAL CAR ASSISTANT
           Hey, you forgot to give me your
           Devotion Club card!
                         
                         
          EXT. TOWNHOUSE, CHICAGO SUBURBS - NIGHT
                         
          Ryan steps out of his rental car and approaches the door of
          the townhouse - checking the address against a piece of
          HILTON STATIONARY.
                         
          Ryan stops, knocks, and puts on a smile.
                         
          We hear Footsteps. The door unlocks and opens revealing ALEX.
          She's wearing sweatpants and glasses. She's at home. She
          looks different.
                         
                          RYAN
           Surprise.
                         
          But there's something else. Alex is in shock... She's frozen.
                         
          Something's wrong. Ryan's smile begins to melt.
                         
          A man's voice calls from inside.
                         
           MAN'S VOICE (O.C.)
           Honey, who's at the door?
                         
          A couple kids run by through the background, giggling. A man
          chases after them.
                         
          Alex is still speechless. Her eyes are angry and apologizing
          all at the same time.
                         
          Ryan just stands there. Emotionally bleeding to death.
                         
                          ALEX
                          (ALMOST INAUDIBLE)
           What are you doing here?
                         
          Ryan begins to step away. He turns and heads for his car,
          dropping the flowers.
                         
          Alex's husband becomes visible just as she's shutting the door.
                         
                          ALEX'S HUSBAND
           Who was that?

           ... just some guy who was lost.
                         
          Ryan gets in his rental car and drives off.

          We're watching Ryan through his window from far away... almost
          as if looking through binoculars. He sits on his bed, tie
          undone, holding a glass with an inch of scotch on his knee.

                          RYAN
           What do you mean? I wanted to see

           Seriously, Ryan? I can't believe
           we're having this conversation. I
           mean what do you want?

           You don't even know what you want.
           I'm sorry that I ruined your night...
           But you could have seriously screwed
           things up for me. That was my family.
           That's my real life.

           Look, Ryan. I'm a grown up. I don't
           hold a grudge. When you're ready to
           be an adult and see me again, just
           give me a call.
                         
          Ryan can't quite believe what he's hearing. There's only one
          thing he can do. He hangs up.

          CTC Calling. He presses IGNORE.
                         
                         
          INT. TICKET DESK - CHICAGO O'HAIRE - DAY
                         
          Ryan walks up to the TICKET DESK. He is more lost than usual.
          There is something plucky about the TICKET AGENT.
                         
           PLUCKY TICKET AGENT
           Welcome back, Mr. Bingham.
           106.
                         
                         
                          RYAN
           Yeah, right, you got me in 2C?
                         
           PLUCKY TICKET AGENT
           Of course. Left side aisle, non-
           bulkhead. Just like you like it.
                         
                          RYAN
           What's got you so fucking happy?
                         
          The plucky agent fades a bit, then tries to recompose.
                         
           PLUCKY TICKET AGENT
           Your boarding card, Mr. Bingham.
                         
          Ryan takes the ticket and exits.
                         
                         
          INT. BOEING 757 - DAY
                         
          Ryan sits doing nothing. Others around him play Sudoku, read
          trashy paperbacks, work on laptops. Ryan just stairs at the
          stitching on the seat in front of him. When... "Bing"
                         
                          PURSER
           Ladies and gentlemen, we have a
           special announcement to make.
                         
          Passengers look up.
                         
                          PURSER (CONT'D)
           Our pilot has just informed me that we
           are passing over the city of Mesa...
           which might not mean much to most of
           you, but means a lot to one of our
           fliers today, because he just hit
           TEN... MILLION... MILES...
                         
                          RYAN
           Oh no...
                         
          The Gershwin theme song for the airline rains down from the
          overhead speakers. Passengers clap. Flight attendants gather
          at Ryan's seat with big smiles and champagne.
                         
          Ryan doesn't even react. He's just stunned.
                         
          The flight attendants separate just enough for a man in a
          bomber jacket to squeeze through. It's Maynard Finch, the
          Chief Pilot from the commercial.
                         
                          MAYNARD FINCH
                          (TO RYAN)
           That seat taken?
           107.
                         
                         
          Maynard gives a little salute to his flight attendants, then
          slides by Ryan to the window seat.
                         
                          MAYNARD FINCH
           You're the youngest yet to hit
           twenty mil. Don't know where you
           found the time...
                          (REMEMBERS)
           Oh right, here you go.
                         
          Maynard pulls out a MEMBERSHIP CARD. It's actually been
          stamped from platinum.
                         
           MAYNARD FINCH (CONT'D)
           Seventh card we've made. Small club.
           We really appreciate your loyalty.
                         
          It has a pair of wings around "Member Number 7". Ryan holds
          it between his fingertips... Catches his own reflection.
                         
                          RYAN
           You know how many times I've
           thought about this moment? Played
           out the conversation I'd have with
           you right here.
                         
                          MAYNARD FINCH
           Really? What did you want to say?
                         
          A long beat.
                         
                          RYAN
           You know, I... I can't remember.
                         
                          MAYNARD FINCH
           That's alright. Happens to all of us.
           (attempts chit chat)
           So, where you from?
                         
          Ryan looks at him straight in the face.
                         
                          RYAN
           I'm from here.
                         
                         
          INT. RYAN'S OFFICE, CTC - NEXT DAY
                         
          Ryan picks up the phone at his desk. He removes his new TEN
          MILLION MILE CARD and dials a number off the back.
                         
                          AIRLINE OPERATOR
           Hello, Mr. Bingham.
           108.
                         
                         
                          RYAN
           Oh, how did you know it was me?
                         
                          AIRLINE OPERATOR
           This is your dedicated line. We
           reserve them for our most loyal and
           dedicated fliers.
                         
                          RYAN
           Oh. I'd like to transfer some of my
           miles. Can you open up an account
           under Jim and Julie Miller?
                         
                          AIRLINE OPERATOR
           Certainly. How many miles would you
           like to transfer?
                         
                          RYAN
           How many miles would it take to
           circle the globe?
                         
                          AIRPORT OPERATOR
           We have our "around-the-world" tickets.
           They're five hundred thousand miles each.
                         
                          RYAN
           Sounds perfect.
                         
          Craig enters Ryan's doorway.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Got a second?
                         
                          RYAN
           (to the airline operator)
           I'm going to have to call you right back.
                         
          Craig takes a seat across from Ryan.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           What happened to you yesterday? I
           was trying to reach you all day.
                         
                          RYAN
           I got tied up in... personal stuff.
           What's going on?
                         
          An uncomfortable beat.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Do you remember Karen Barnes?
                         
          Ryan doesn't.
           109.
                         
                         
           CRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D)
           She was part of a thirty person
           reduction a few weeks back in
           Wichita. Natalie fired her.
                         
                          RYAN
           No, I fire dozens of people a day.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           She killed herself. Jumped off a bridge.
                         
                          RYAN
           Fuck.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
                          (AGREES)
           Yeah.
                          (FORMALITY)
           Do you remember anyone giving you any
           signals of anything? Depression?
                         
                          RYAN
           They're all depressed. We're firing them.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Hey, look, you know I have to ask.
                         
                          RYAN
           No, I don't remember anything. Of
           course they're upset. You never
           think that...
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Wasn't any woman who gave you any
           indication...? Anything?
                         
          Ryan remembers her.
                         
                          RYAN
           No, nothing that stands out.
                          (A THOUGHT)
           Is Natalie alright? Is she coming in?
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Natalie quit.
                         
          Ryan isn't surprised.
                         
                          RYAN
           Just like that?
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Text message.
           110.
                         
                         
          Ryan stifles a laugh.
                         
           CRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D)
           Yeah, real fucking nice, right? No
           one has manners anymore.
                         
                          RYAN
           She say where she was going?
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Nah. She was pretty upset.
                         
                          RYAN
           I should give her a call.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
                          (BUSINESS)
           I need you back in the air.
                         
          Ryan doesn't react.
                         
           CRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D)
           Did you hear me? I thought you'd be
           thrilled.
                         
                          RYAN
           I'm fine. What about video conferencing?
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           CTC is pausing on the whole new media
           front for a moment. Giving it a little
           more thought. Getting our work horses
           back out doing what they do best.
                         
                          RYAN
           How long are you sending me out?
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           We're going to let you sail and
           sail. Send us a postcard if you
           ever get there.
                         
          Ryan absorbs this. Nods.
                         
                         
          INT. OFFICE, SAN FRANCISCO - DAY
                         
          A MANAGEMENT LEVEL GUY sits at his desk. Bay Area sports
          paraphernalia on the wall.
                         
                          MANAGER
           So, what happened?
                         
          We turn to reveal Natalie.
           111.
                         
                         
                          NATALIE
           How exactly do you mean?
                         
                          MANAGER
           You graduated top of your class.
           You seemed to have your pick of
           employment... Including right here.
           Instead, you went to Omaha... to
           fire people for a living.
                         
                          NATALIE
                          (OBVIOUS COVER)
           It's challenging work.
                         
                          MANAGER
           I can't imagine doing that day-in-
           day-out. Not in this climate.
                         
                          NATALIE
           (after a beat)
           ... I followed a boy.
                         
          The manager smiles to himself.
                         
                          MANAGER
           Everybody does at one point or
           another.
                         
          The manager raises a letter - It's Ryan's letter.
                         
                          MANAGER
           This guy says I'd be lucky to have
           you.
                         
                         
          INT. RYAN'S OFFICE, CTC - DAY
                         
          Ryan writing the letter. We hear what he's writing...
                         
           RYAN (V.O.)
           To whom it may concern, I can't even
           count the number of people I've fired
           in my lifetime. So many, that I've
           forgotten what it's like to actually
           hire somebody. We've never met, but I
           know you'd be lucky to have Natalie
           Keener. My advice? Take her and don't
           look back. She'll be the best

          The manager puts down the letter and reaches out a hand.
                         
                          MANAGER
           Hope he's right.
                         
          Natalie breaks into a smile, then jumps back to professional.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, RYAN'S LOFT - DAY
                         
          Ryan steps out his front door, ROLL-AWAY in tow.
                         
                         
          INT. OMAHA AIRPORT - DAY
                         
          Ryan walks through the automated door. He looks like he did
          in the opening of the film. Maybe even wearing the same
          clothes. Something is different though.
                         
           RYAN (V.O.)
           Tonight, most people will be
           welcomed home by jumping dogs and
           squealing kids. Their spouses will
           ask about their day and tonight
           they'll sleep.
                         
          Ryan stops and looks up at a GIANT BOARD OF DESTINATIONS. An
          endless list of cities around the world. A menu of new lives
          departing every five minutes.
                         
           RYAN (V.O.)
           The stars will wheel forth from their
           daytime hiding places.
                         
          We look back at Ryan. His eyes lock on one of the cities. We
          don't see which one. He makes a mental decision and turns in
          the direction of the gate. He lets go of his ROLL-AWAY.
                         
           RYAN (V.O.)
           And one of those lights, slightly
           brighter than the rest, will be my
           wingtip, passing over, blessing them.
                         
          Ryan takes a step, but before his foot can land we...

          In the darkness, we hear a voice, a woman's voice.  Her name
          is Evey.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    "Remember, remember, the fifth of
                    November, the gunpowder treason and
                    plot.  I know of now reason why the
                    gunpowder treason should ever be
                    forgot."
          
          Her voice has a strength that is metered by a calmness, a
          deep centered peace that we can feel.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Those were almost the very first
                    words he spoke to me and, in a way,
                    that is where this story began,
                    four hundred years ago, in a cellar
                    beneath the Houses of Parliament.
          
          In the darkness, we find a lantern.  Guy Fawkes, a dangerous
          man who wears a goatee, is struggling with a wheelbarrow
          stacked with barrels of gunpowder.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    In 1605, Guy Fawkes attempted to
                    blow up the Houses of Parliament.
          
          The wheelbarrow bumps over the heavy stone mortar of the
          cellar floor.  From the dark depths, we hear the sound of
          dogs.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    He was caught in the cellars with
                    enough gunpowder to level most of
                    London.
          
          Guy sees lanterns coming from both sides.  He tries to run as
          the dogs reach him first.  He grabs for his sword as dozens
          of pole axes pin him against the tunnel's stone wall.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Sometimes I wonder where we would
                    be if he hadn't failed.  I wonder
                    if it would have mattered.
          
          In the dim pre-dawn light, Guy is led to the gallows.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I suppose the answer is in the
                    rhyme.  More than the man, what we
                    must remember is the plot itself.
          
          The coarse noose of rope is snugged up to Guy's throat.  He
          looks into the crowd until he finds a face, a woman's face,
          staring up at him.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    For in the plot we find more than
                    just a man, we find the idea of
                    that man, the spirit of that man,
                    and that is what we must never
                    forget.
          
          The lever is thrown and the woman looks down, a tear falling
          down her face.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    This, then, is the story of that
                    idea, of that spirit that began
                    with an anarchist's plot four
                    hundred years ago.
          
          Guy's body hangs in silhouette, lifeless against a red
          morning sun.

          INT.  SUBURBAN HOUSE
          
          A young Evey sits on her father's lap, combing her Barbie's
          hair.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I was born near the end of the
                    millennium, the year 1997.  My
                    father used to say that people were
                    so afraid that the world was going
                    to end that they were willing it to
                    happen.
          
          Her father sits beside her mother on the living room couch,
          watching the news.  From the look on their faces, the news is
          bad.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I don't remember much of the
                    century's turn.  I don't remember
                    the market crash or the plague or
                    any of the Trafalgar riots.
          
          The television flickers with images of heavily armed soldiers
          fighting in a shelled city.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I've read about them since but I
                    don't recall how any of them
                    impacted my life except for the
                    fear.  They would hide it from me,
                    like a secret between them.
          
          Little Evey sees her father staring at her mother.  They
          take hold of each other's hand, clasping them tight.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    But I could feel it.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          It is a new day.  People are gathered along the street as if
          they were waiting for a parade.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Of the chaos that seemed to swallow
                    the beginning of the 21st century,
                    there is one thing I do remember.
          
          Evey holds her father's hand.  Unable to see what is coming,
          she can hear it.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Very clearly, I can remember that
                    sound.
          
          We hear them, hundreds of marching soldiers.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    And I remember those boots, black
                    leather that gleamed bright in the
                    morning sun.  I had never seen such
                    boots.  All moving in perfect
                    unison.
          
          Little Evey hides in the forest of adults, clinging to her
          father's leg, staring as row after row of boots march by with
          military precision.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          In the midst of a political rally for the emerging new party
          calling itself Norsefire, we find little Evey now on her
          father's shoulders.
          
          Dascombe, a young man, paces the podium, inciting the crowd.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    The time has come, London, to
                    return to a bygone age, an age of
                    tradition, an age of values that
                    have been disparaged and all but
                    forgotten.  What this country needs
                    is a leader!  A true leader to
                    remind us of that age.  A righteous
                    leader with the strength of his
                    moral convictions to do what must
                    be done.  I give you that man!  I
                    give you our leader!  Adam Susan!
          
          Adam Susan rises and the crowd cheers.  Evey's father looks
          at her mother and again they clasp hands.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    It must have seemed so easy to
                    them.  They offered such a simple
                    deal; give up control and we will
                    restore order.
          
          INT.  SUBURBAN HOUSE
          
          Little Evey is asleep in her bedroom.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    At first, the arrests were
                    political.  Dissidents.  Radicals. 
                    Liberals.
          
          A loud crash of splintering wood wakes her up.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    When my parents were younger, they
                    had been activists.  They had
                    marched with Labor in the great
                    train strike.
          
          The sound of heavy boots swarms through the house.
          
                              LITTLE EVEY
                    Mommy?
          
          Her bedroom door bursts open and a heavily armed soldier
          scoops her up.
          
          She is carried through the dark house which is filled with
          soldiers.  On the floor of the living room, she sees her
          parents being bound with plastic zip-ties.
          
                              MOTHER
                    My daughter!  Don't take my
                    daughter!
          
                              FATHER
                    Evey!  Evey!
          
                              LITTLE EVEY
                    Mommy!  Daddy!
          
          A heavy black hood is pulled over each of her parent's heads
          as Evey is carried out of the house.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I never saw them again.  Overnight,
                    my life, my entire world was
                    erased.
          
          INT.  BATHROOM
          
          A nun with a switch in her crossed arms watches as Evey and
          several other little girls scrub the floor of a dormitory
          bathroom.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    It was done so quickly and
                    violently, so completely, that it
                    began to seem that it had never
                    even existed.
          
          A tear rolls down Little Evey's cheek.
          
          EXT.  HOUSE
          
          A gay man is dragged violently from his Piccadilly home. 
          Outside, he sees his lover being forced to the cobblestones.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    The homosexuals were next.  What
                    God had started with AIDS had to be
                    finished by man.  It was God's
                    work.  That's what we were told.
          
          He reaches for him as the clubs rise and fall, vicious and
          bloody.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    But once they were gone, there was
                    someone else.  Someone different.
          
          In another neighborhood, we see the police arresting
          Pakistanis.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Someone dangerous.
          
          In a different area, young black men are packed into a caged
          van so tightly they are unable to move.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    There were those who understood
                    what was happening, who knew it was
                    wrong but who kept silent.
          
          A young detective named Finch looks down as the van pulls
          away.  When he looks up, another man in a military uniform
          whose name is Almond is watching him.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    And in the vacuum of that silence,
                    order was imposed.
          
          Finch sticks his pipe in his mouth and turns away.
          
          EXT.  STREET
          
          Again, we see the marching boots.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Order that was like those boots,
                    order that required rigorous
                    discipline.  Order that is exactly
                    the same, where each single step
                    falls with every step.  The order
                    of the many shaped into one.
          
          We move through the columns of marching soldiers to a wall
          where a poster has been plastered up.  The poster reads,
          "Strength Through Purity, Purity Through Faith."
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Somehow in my heart, I knew it
                    wouldn't last.
          
          As the sound of the marching fades, a shadow falls over the
          sign.
          
          After a moment, we hear the hiss of spray paint.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    What they thought they had crushed,
                    the spirit they believed trampled
                    and ground beneath the marching of
                    their boots, rose up, rose as if
                    from a four hundred year old grave,
                    rose to remind us all that day.
          
          The shadow sprays a "V" over the poster.
          
                                                          FADE OUT.
          
          FADE IN:
          
          Close on a loudspeaker.  There is one on every major street
          corner.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    Good evening, London.  It's nine
                    o'clock, the fourth of November in
                    the year 2019 and this is the voice
                    of Fate broadcasting on 275 and 285
                    of the medium wave.
          
          Beneath the loudspeaker is a surveillance system labeled,
          "For your protection."
          
          Bubble eyed lenses iris at the end of stalks that move,
          insect-like, racheting and clicking as they watch a little
          girl pedal her bicycle.  The little girl glances nervously
          over her shoulder up at the mechanical eyes watching her.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    People of London, be advised --
          
          EXT.  EVEY'S APARTMENT
          
          There is a radio on a small makeup table.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    -- that Braxton and Streathon are
                    quarantine zones as of today.
          
          Evey is now a young woman.  She slips into a dress that is
          little more than a nightgown.  She tries to adjust it,
          pulling it down at the hem, pulling it up at the thin
          shoulder straps, but it is like trying to hide behind a
          lamppost.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    It is suggested that these area be
                    avoided for reasons of health and
                    safety.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          Another radio in a room that seems to be of another world.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    Good news following the
                    productivity reports from
                    Herefordshire indicating a possible
                    end to meat rationing starting mid
                    February.
          
          A man enters the room as he once entered the world.  His body
          is lean and strong and though we do not see his face, there
          is a strength in his carriage, a power to his presence.
          
          INT.  EVEY'S APARTMENT
          
          She packs tissue paper into the toes of a pair of high heels
          that are too big for her.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    Police raided seventeen homes in
                    the Birmingham area, uncovering
                    what is believed to be a major
                    terrorist ring.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          We move over a dressing bureau, past a wig and over a pair of
          black leather gloves, moving until we find the mask; it is
          like something from the masquerade ball of another era.  It
          has an exaggerated goatee, harlequin cheeks and a smile,
          forever fixed, at once be-guiling and be-deviling.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    Twenty eight people, eight of them
                    women, are currently in detention
                    awaiting trial.
          
          INT.  EVEY'S APARTMENT
          
          Evey coats her lips with a lascivious red.  She stares into
          the mirror, her makeup like a mask over her own face.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    And that is the face of London
                    tonight.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          The man, now fully dressed in cloak, hat, and mask gazes into
          the mirror.
          
          This is V.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    And this is the voice of Fate
                    signing off and bidding you a
                    pleasant evening.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          Close on Evey's high heels, stumbling and awkward as she
          walks down a dark cobblestoned street.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          Close on V's boots walking in the opposite direction so that
          it seems they are walking towards each other.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I don't know what brought us
                    together that night.  I had never
                    been to that part of Westminster
                    but ever since I've known him, I've
                    stopped believing in coincidence.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          Evey looks up and sees a man standing mostly in shadow.
          
                              EVEY
                    Excuse me?  Uh... excuse me,
                    Mister?
          
          The man turns around.  It is not V.
          
                              EVEY
                    Would you like... uh, would you
                    like to sleep with me?
          
          He smiles.
          
                              EVEY
                    I mean, for money.
          
                              MAN
                    That is the clumsiest bit of
                    propositioning I've ever heard.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh god, I'm sorry.
          
                              MAN
                    Is this your first time, darling?
          
                              EVEY
                    Yes, no, I mean for money.  But I
                    know what you want and I'll do it.
          
          She presses her body to his, using her little girl eyes and
          her woman's mouth.
          
                              EVEY
                    Anything you want, mister.  Please,
                    I need the money.  I know I'm young
                    but I promise I know what I'm
                    doing.
          
                              MAN
                    No.  You don't know what you're
                    doing.
          
          He pulls out his wallet and shows her a badge.  The sight of
          it knocks the breath out of her.
          
                              EVEY
                    Christ, you're a Fingerman.
          
                              FINGERMAN 1
                    Give the little lady a prize.
          
                              FINGERMAN 2
                    I've got something to give her.
          
          Evey turns and there are more Fingermen behind her.
          
                              FINGERMAN 1
                    Prostitution is a class H offense. 
                    Know what that means?  It means
                    that we get to exercise our own
                    judicial discretion --
          
                              FINGERMAN 2
                    And you get to swallow it.
          
          The Fingermen laugh.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh god, please.  It's my first
                    time.  Please don't hurt me.
          
                              FINGERMAN 1
                    Gosh, fellas, look at those big
                    innocent eyes.  What do you think?
          
                              FINGERMAN 3
                    Spare the rod, spoil the child.
          
          Fingerman 2 laughs hard as he drops his pants.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh no!
          
          He shoves her face first against a brick wall, lifting her
          dress to expose her bottom.
          
                              EVEY
                    Please, don't!
          
                              FINGERMAN 3
                    You heard the man, sweetie.  This
                    rod's for your own good.
          
          Suddenly, they are no longer alone.
          
                              V
                    "The multiplying villainies of
                    nature do swarm upon him."
          
                              FINGERMAN 3
                    What the hell --
          
                              V
                    "And fortune, on his damned
                    quarrel, smiling, showed like a
                    rebel's whore."
          
                              FINGERMAN 1
                    We're police officers, pal.
          
                              FINGERMAN 4
                    We're with the Finger.
          
                              FINGERMAN 3
                    So bugger off!
          
                              V
                    "Disdaining fortune with his
                    brandished steel, which smoked with
                    bloody execution."
          
          In the clenched fist of black leather, we see a flash of
          steel.
          
                              FINGERMAN 1
                    He's got a knife!
          
          V attacks and at once we know this is no normal human being. 
          A single blow sends the largest of the Fingermen flying
          backwards.
          
          But more than his strength, it is his speed.
          
          A gun is cocked but before the hammer falls, a knife is
          buried in the Fingerman's chest and --
          
          Before the body falls, the knife is gone.
          
          It takes a handful of seconds and three bodies lay on the
          ground.  V turns to the last Fingerman who is struggling to
          pull his pants up.
          
                              FINGERMAN 3
                    Jesus Christ!  Don't hurt me!
          
          V steps forward and he screams, bolting while holding his
          pants up.
          
                              V
                    Good evening.
          
                              EVEY
                    Who -- Who are you?
          
                              V
                    Me?  I imagine all manner of names
                    shall be heaped upon my humble
                    visage but, for now, let us simply
                    say I am the villain.
          
          He throws wide his cloak and bows deeply to her.
          
                              V
                    And you would be?
          
                              EVEY
                    Evey.
          
                              V
                    Of course.
          
          They hear sirens rushing towards them.  In a blink, he scoops
          her up and dashes into the shadows of a narrow alleyway.
          
          EXT.  ROOFTOPS
          
          Police cars and several ambulances swarm over the area with
          the dead Fingermen.
          
          V watches them from above.
          
                              EVEY
                    Why did you do that?  Why did
                    you... help me?
          
                              V
                    Why indeed?
          
          He takes out an old antique pocket watch.  It is almost
          midnight.
          
                              V
                    Almost time.
          
                              EVEY
                    For what?
          
                              V
                    For the music.
          
                              EVEY
                    Music?
          
                              V
                    Yes, music.  My music.  You see. 
                    Evey, I am a performer.
          
                              EVEY
                    Is that why you're wearing a mask?
          
                              V
                    We all wear masks.  Life creates
                    them and forces us to find the one
                    that fits.  Do you know what day it
                    is?
          
                              EVEY
                    Uh... November fourth.
          
                              V
                    Not for long.
          
          He looks out where, rising above the rooftops, he can see Big
          Ben.
          
                              V
                    "Remember, remember, the fifth of
                    November, the gunpowder treason and
                    plot.  I know of no reason why the
                    gunpowder treason should ever be
                    forgot."
          
          The second hand sweeps into the final minute.
          
                              V
                    Tell me, Evey, what good is an
                    actor that plays his part to an
                    empty theatre?
          
                              EVEY
                    I don't know.
          
                              V
                    Nor do I.  That's why you are here. 
                    I need you, Evey.  I need someone
                    to listen.
          
                              EVEY
                    To your music?
          
                              V
                    Yes.  Yes, to my music.
          
          From his sleeve, he pulls a conductor's wand.
          
                              V
                    Can you hear it?  It's already
                    begun.
          
          He begins to lightly tap the wand in the air and, very
          faintly, we hear it.
          
                              EVEY
                    I can't hear anything.
          
                              V
                    At first, you have to listen very
                    carefully...
          
          He continues to conduct and we begin to hear the music,
          violins and horns that seem almost like a whisper or a wind
          that steadily swells.
          
                              V
                    Ahh, yes.  There it is.  Beautiful,
                    is it not?
          
          He turns to the parapet, his gestures growing grander as the
          music rises and we recognize Tchaikovsky's 1812 overture.
          
          The music mounts a climax and V points the wand at Big Ben as
          cymbals crash --
          
          Big Ben explodes with such force the world seems to shake,
          while --
          
          V, smiling, always smiling, points again with another
          crescendo and --
          
          The statue of justice is blown to smithereens.
          
          V nods in appreciation while mustering the music towards it's
          finale as fireworks begin lighting up the sky.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh my...
          
          Everywhere across the city, people stand transfixed by the
          dazzling shimmer of the fireworks until --
          
          A strobing final blitz leaves a single, starry image floating
          in the smoke filled sky.
          
          It is the letter V.
          
                              EVEY
                    It's beautiful...
          
                              V
                    Thank you.
          
          From every direction, the city screams with the panicked
          sound of sirens.
          
          EXT.  NEW GOVERNMENT BUILDING
          
          A massive modern building that is the seat of the new
          government.
          
          A long, black car pulls up to the entrance.  Adam Susan gets
          out, wearing a long black trenchcoat over his pajamas.  He is
          the Leader and he looks older, heavier, and meaner.
          
          He hurries past the heavily armed guards, barely
          acknowledging the snap and cock of their Nazi-like salute.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE
          
          The Leader enters his main chambers and we see the Fate
          computer system.
          
          It is a cerebral cortex for a vast intelligence network. 
          Information can almost be felt coursing through its hard
          drives.
          
          The Leader sits, at once regaining a measure of composure. 
          He takes a deep calming breath and accesses the system.
          
          Dozens of monitors fill with images from all across the city,
          most of them are of the damage caused by V.
          
                              LEADER
                    Gentlemen, I will hear your reports
                    now.  Mr. Heyer, speak for the Eye.
          
          Conrad Heyer appears on one of the screens.  He is at his
          desk inside the command center for the Eye, the governmental
          organization responsible for the visual surveillance systems.
          
                              CONRAD
                    We have less than two minutes of
                    usable footage, Leader.  It took
                    the suspect less than a minute to
                    dispatch the Finger's vice patrol.
          
          On an insert screen, we see grainy footage of V rescuing Evey
          from one of the pole-mounted cameras.
          
                              CONRAD
                    As you can see, the suspect's
                    reflex speed is extraordinary.  As
                    is his strength.
          
          As the last body falls, V seems to pause and looks back over
          his shoulder straight into the camera.
          
                              LEADER
                    Freeze it!
          
          The Leader stares at the smiling face.
          
                              CONRAD
                    I'm afraid the mask makes retinal
                    identification impossible.
          
                              LEADER
                    Mr. Etheridge, report for the Ear!
          
          Bunny Etheridge appears on another screen.  Behind him, huge
          spooling reels of audiotape wind constantly.
          
                              ETHERIDGE
                    We were able to triangulate the
                    origin of the fireworks.  We also
                    are currently monitoring a lot of
                    phone surveillance indicating a
                    high percentage of conversation
                    concerned with the explosions.  All
                    suspect or significant transcripts
                    are being forwarded to Mr. Almond.
          
                              LEADER
                    Very good.  Mr. Finch, speak for
                    the Nose.
          
          Finch, no longer the same young man, stands at the site of
          the fireworks launch.
          
                              FINCH
                    Thanks to Etheridge, we found the
                    launch for the fireworks.  These
                    appear to be individually weighted
                    flares and we have found traces of
                    the same chemicals at both of the
                    detonation sites which leads us to
                    conclude that, despite a level of
                    sophistication, these devices are
                    all home-made with over the counter
                    chemicals, making them impossible
                    to trace.  Whoever he is, Leader,
                    he's good.
          
                              LEADER
                    Thank you for that professional
                    annotation.
          
          An intercom opens.
          
                              LIEUTENANT (V.O.)
                    Leader, Mr. Almond has arrived.
          
                              LEADER
                    Very good.  Gentlemen, keep me
                    informed of any further
                    developments.  England prevails.
          
          They answer in unison as Almond enters the office.  His face
          is harder but he has the same violent gleam in his eye.
          
          The Leader turns in his chair.
          
                              LEADER
                    Mr. Almond, do you know what this
                    is behind me?
          
                              ALMOND
                    Uh... the Fate computer system,
                    sir?
          
                              LEADER
                    No.  No sir.  It's more than that. 
                    This, this computer is a symbol,
                    Mr. Almond.  A symbol of the
                    highest attainable goal of mankind. 
                    Do you know what that goal is, Mr.
                    Almond?
          
          Almond does not.  The Leader leaps from his chair while
          pounding the desk.
          
                              LEADER
                    Control, Mr. Almond!  Control!  The
                    world around us is a changing,
                    directionless, amoral morass and it
                    is up to man and man alone to set
                    things right!
          
          He moves around the desk at Almond.
          
                              LEADER
                    Without control, man is nothing
                    more than any other stinking,
                    sweating, brute animal.  Control,
                    Mr. Almond.  The control that we
                    have painstakingly built up over
                    the last ten years.  Now, do you
                    understand what happened last
                    night?
          
                              ALMOND
                    We... lost control.
          
                              LEADER
                    Yes, Mr. Almond.  Last night
                    someone did the unthinkable. 
                    Someone hurt us.  It is imperative
                    that we act swiftly and precisely. 
                    I want that man found, Mr. Almond. 
                    I want his head or, by god, I'll
                    have yours.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          Evey is wearing a blindfold and V leads her by her
          fingertips, guiding her almost as if they were dancing...
          
          His fingers slip free of her and she reaches out.
          
                              EVEY
                    Wait.  I've lost you.
          
                              V
                    No, you haven't.
          
          He is behind her and he removes the blindfold, revealing his
          house to her.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh...
          
          It is a labyrinth of interconnecting underground tunnels and
          rooms.
          
          The gallery is the main room as it is filled with an amazing
          collection of human culture.  There is art that spans from
          the renaissance to the painted covers of Eerie comics,
          literature that ranges from Shakespeare to Spillane,
          philosophy from Plato to Bukowski, and a vast collection of
          nonfiction.
          
          There are movie posters everywhere and an entire wall is
          lined with videocassettes.
          
          A jukebox stands in front of an enormous vinyl and CD
          collection of music.
          
                              EVEY
                    A jukebox?  Where did you get it?
          
                              V
                    I saved it.  Like everything here.
          
          She punches a button and Billie Holiday begins to sing.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh, it's beautiful.  I've never
                    heard anything like it.
          
                              V
                    Of course not.  You grew up in
                    their world.  Art is created by
                    individuals and there are no
                    individuals in a world where you
                    are told what to think.
          
                              EVEY
                    This place is amazing.
          
                              V
                    You're welcome to stay.
          
          She stops suddenly and looks at him.  The offer is terribly
          exciting but it is so unlike anything she has ever done that
          it's almost impossible to imagine.
          
                              EVEY
                    Stay here... with you?
          
                              V
                    Yes.  If you like.
          
                              EVEY
                    I... I don't even know your name.
          
                              V
                    I don't have a name.  But you can
                    call me V.
          
                              EVEY
                    V?  V... I like that.
          
          And she returns his smile.
          
          EXT.  JORDAN TOWER
          
          The only operating broadcast tower in London; home of the
          Mouth.
          
          INT.  RADIO BROADCAST BOOTH
          
          Lewis Prothero leans forward and lets his voice pour like
          syrup over the microphone.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Good morning, London.  This is the
                    voice of Fate -- Damn.
          
          He stops and coughs.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Good morning -- ack.  Good morning
                    Lond-- Goddammit!  Where is my
                    bloody tea?!
          
          In the control booth, Roger Dascombe, his hair thinner now,
          rubs his temple.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    Would someone get his lordship his
                    bloody tea?
          
          He clicks on the microphone.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    Lewis, they want this report on the
                    first hour --
          
                              PROTHERO
                    I know.  I know.  Damned
                    inconvenient this entire affair. 
                    Fine.  Let's try again.
          
          He clears his voice and the red "record" light turns on.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Good morning, London.  It is 6 am,
                    the fifth of November 2019 and this
                    is the voice of Fate.  The new day
                    brings good news and bright
                    prospects from overseas, where
                    negotiations with New China are
                    moving in a positive direction. 
                    Last night's scheduled demolition
                    of two deteriorating landmarks went
                    off without a hitch.
          
          Dascombe is unable to stop himself from smiling.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Spokesman for the Interior ministry
                    said both structures were severely
                    damaged and judged to be a danger
                    to the unsuspecting public.  Plans
                    for new landmarks are well
                    underway.
          
          Prothero sits back, shaking his head.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Do you believe this crap, Dascombe?
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    It's not our job to believe it,
                    Lewis.  Our job is to tell the
                    people --
          
                              PROTHERO
                    "Exactly what they tell us."  I
                    Know but do you think that people
                    will believe it?
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    They will if it's you that's
                    telling it to them.  Now let's try
                    it again.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          V is alone, listening to the first morning broadcast.
          
                              PROTHERO (V.O.)
                    ... plans for new landmarks are
                    already well underway.
          
          He clicks off the radio.  Walking down a hall, he stops and
          peers into Evey's new bedroom.
          
          She is fast asleep, looking remarkably at peace.  Quietly, he
          shuts the door.
          
          EXT.  TRAIN STATION
          
          People are hurrying to board a departing train.
          
          INT.  TRAIN CAR
          
          Prothero is staring out his window.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    "Remember, remember, the fifth of
                    November..."
          
          He talks to his bodyguards almost as if talking to himself.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Do you suppose that's why he did
                    it?
          
                              BODYGUARD 1
                    Sir, who did what, sir?
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Guy Fawkes.  He tried to blow up
                    Parliament.
          
          The guards look at each other, confused.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Don't they teach history in school
                    anymore?
          
                              BODYGUARD 1
                    Sir, we're both straight military,
                    sir.
          
                              BODYGUARD 2
                    Sir, yes, sir.  I was fighting in
                    Ireland by the time I was sixteen.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Yes, of course.  My mistake.
          
          He turns back to his window.
          
          EXT.  RAILROAD
          
          The train rumbles along, heading for a tunnel.
          
          INT.  TRAIN CAR
          
          Prothero watches the countryside rolling past.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    I love trains.  I remember riding
                    the underground with my father. 
                    Shame they shut them all down.
          
          Bodyguard 1 looks out the opposite window just as the train
          enters the tunnel.
          
                              BODYGUARD 1
                    What the hell's that!
          
          EXT.  TRAIN
          
          For a flashing instant, we see V in silhouette, cloak
          swirling around him like dark wings as he jumps from the
          bridge onto the train.
          
          INT.  TRAIN CAR
          
          Prothero and Bodyguard 2 stare at Bodyguard 1.
          
                              BODYGUARD 1
                    I thought I saw a man jumping onto
                    the train.
          
                              BODYGUARD 2
                    The train's doing almost seventy. 
                    It would break his legs.
          
                              BODYGUARD 1
                    You're right, I... It must have
                    been rags.
          
          EXT.  TRAIN
          
          Deep in the tunnel, a dark figure glides across the rooftops.
          
          INT.  CONDUCTOR'S CAB
          
          The conductor hears something on the roof.  He peers up just
          as V swings down, smashing feet first into the cab.
          
          INT.  TRAIN CAR
          
          The brakes suddenly lock, throwing Bodyguard 2 into Prothero.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Get off of me!
          
          A moment later, the lights are cut off and the entire train
          is plunged into complete darkness.
          
                              BODYGUARD 2
                    What the fuck is going on?
          
                              BODYGUARD 1
                    Lock the car doors.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    I have a lighter... somewhere...
          
                              BODYGUARD 2
                    I can't find the lock -- wait.  Hey
                    wha--
          
          There is a muffled shriek followed by a sharp snap.
          
                              BODYGUARD 1
                    What's happening --
          
          There is another sound, like the leather slap of a boxer
          pounding a heavy bag, followed by the sound of the heavy bag
          collapsing onto the floor.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    I found it!
          
          He flicks on the lighter and, in the dim light of its flame,
          he sees the smiling face.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Oh god.
          
          V sits casually, arms folded, across from Prothero.  The
          bodyguards lay dead on the floor.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Who are you?  What do you want? 
                    Money?  Is that it?
          
          V just smiles.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Wait, wait.  You're, you're the one
                    that blew the Bailey.
          
          V nods and Prothero's eyes go wide.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    You're making a mistake.  I'm
                    nobody --
          
          On the floor, he sees the bodyguard's gun.  He kills the
          lighter and dives for it.
          
          In the darkness, we hear the struggle.  It ends quickly. 
          When the lighter flicks back on, V is holding it and the gun.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Oh god, what do you want?
          
                              V
                    I've come to offer you a choice. 
                    Commander Prothero.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    What -- What did you call me?
          
                              V
                    Commander Prothero.
          
          Prothero's heart begins to pound.
          
                              V
                    That was your title at Larkhill. 
                    You remember Larkhill, don't you,
                    Commander?
          
          EXT.  LARKHILL RESETTLEMENT CAMP - FLASHBACK
          
          A sign reads, "Larkhill Resettlement Camp."
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    Where they sent the undesirables.
          
          A caged truck packed with minorities rolls into the gates
          which are topped with spools of razor wire.
          
          INT.  TRAIN CAR
          
          Prothero is sweating.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    I don't know what you're talking
                    about.
          
                              V
                    Maybe I can help your memory. 
                    Let's see.  Larkhill opened in the
                    summer of 2009.  You were appointed
                    it commander.  You wore a uniform
                    in those days.  You looked very
                    good in it.
          
          INT.  LARKHILL - PROTHERO'S OFFICE - FLASHBACK
          
          Prothero admires his uniform in the mirror.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    You were a man of many
                    responsibilities.  You made sure
                    Larkhill made all its quotas,
                    especially the oven quotas even
                    though they required an excessive
                    amount of maintenance.
          
          EXT.  LARKHILL OVENS - FLASHBACK
          
          We see a detail of black and Indian men, shoveling mounds of
          black ash from a series of furnace like ovens.
          
          As the shovels lift, we see blackened bones and burnt skulls.
          
          EXT.  LARKHILL MAIN YARD - FLASHBACK
          
          Prothero saunters through the lines of camp prisoners.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    But there was one task you took to
                    with exceptional relish.  Remember
                    the medical block, Commander?  I
                    believe you called it the funny
                    farm.  You were the one that
                    selected the prisoners.  You hand
                    picked each one.
          
          Prothero steps in front of a woman who remains beautiful
          despite the suffering she has endured.  Prothero smiles.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Her.
          
          As the guards grab her, we become aware of a man that is
          staring at Prothero.  He is one of the prisoners but we do
          not see his face.
          
          Prothero notices the man.  He doesn't like the way the man is
          staring at him.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    You.
          
          INT.  TRAIN CAR
          
          Prothero is terrified.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    You!  You're him, aren't you?
          
          V nods.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Oh my god!  What are you going to
                    do?
          
                              V
                    You gave us a choice, remember,
                    Commander?  You said we could
                    cooperate with the doctors or...
          
          V cocks the gun.
          
                              V
                    Hold out your hand.
          
          Trembling, Prothero sticks out his hand.  V lets the light
          die for a moment.
          
          When he flicks it back on, Prothero is holding a long, metal
          syringe filled with a murky liquid.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Oh no, no!  Please I was just doing
                    what I was told!
          
                              V
                    Of course you were.  Now I'm
                    telling you to make a choice. 
                    Either you stick that syringe into
                    your neck or --
          
          He presses the gun barrel to Prothero's forehead.
          
                              V
                    I can kill you right now.
          
          Prothero begins to blubber.
          
                              V
                    Crying doesn't help, Commander.  I
                    remember there was a woman who had
                    been screaming for two days.  You
                    winked at the doctor and laughed,
                    "All in the name of science."
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Please, don't make me do this...
          
                              V
                    It's a difficult choice, isn't it? 
                    Certain death versus something that
                    might be... worse.  But you never
                    know.  There is still a chance. 
                    You could survive.  Look at me. 
                    Now, time's up, Commander.  Choose.
          
          Anger galvanizes his fear and steadily Prothero lifts the
          needle towards his neck.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    I'll see you in hell.
          
          He jams the needle in and sinks the plunger.
          
                              V
                    Yes.  I'm quite sure you will.
          
          INT.  TRAIN
          
          Train workers with flashlights hurry through the cars.
          
                              TRAIN MAN
                    This door's locked!
          
          He slams a shoulder against it and the door gives in.
          
                              TRAIN MAN
                    Holy Christ!
          
          Flashlights sweep over the dead bodyguards.  The train man
          hears a strange gurgling rasp and he turns, finding Prothero
          in his light.
          
                              TRAIN MAN
                    What happened here?
          
          Prothero is foaming at the mouth while a thick mucus bubbles
          from his nose.  His breath comes in tiny rasps.
          
                              TRAIN MAN
                    Good lord!  I need a medic here.
          
          Prothero becomes more animate, trying to tell the man
          something.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Fi... Fi... Fi...
          
                              TRAIN MAN 2
                    He's trying to say something.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Five.
          
                              TRAIN MAN 1
                    Five?  Where's the goddamn medic?
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Room five.
          
          Suddenly, his body convulses and blood pours out his ears. 
          His body slumps over.
          
                              TRAIN MAN 2
                    I think he needs a priest.
          
          EXT.  TRAIN STATION
          
          The station is swarming with police.  A stretcher wheels a
          body in a black plastic bag out from Prothero's car.
          
          INT.  TRAIN CAR
          
          Finch puffs on his pipe, staring at something spray painted
          on the wall of the train car: a "V" with a circle around it.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    What do you make of this, Mr.
                    Finch?
          
          Dominic, Finch's younger assistant, is holding a flower in
          his rubber gloved hand.
          
                              FINCH
                    Hmm.  It's a rose.  A violet
                    carson, I believe.  Strange.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Strange?
          
                              FINCH
                    I didn't think they still existed.
          
                              SOLDIER
                    Mr. Finch!  Sir!
          
          Finch turns as a soldier with a radio steps into the car.
          
                              SOLDIER
                    Sir, they want you at headquarters,
                    sir.
          
                              FINCH
                    Now?
          
                              SOLDIER
                    Yes, sir.  I'm to transport you
                    immediately.
          
                              FINCH
                    Send the rose to the lab.  Also,
                    scrape a sample of this paint and
                    have it analyzed as well.  I'll be
                    back as soon as I can.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE
          
          The door opens and Finch steps in.
          
                              LEADER
                    Ah, Mr. Finch.  I sent for you
                    because what I have to say cannot
                    be said over a phone or a radio. 
                    What I have to say cannot leave
                    these four walls.  Do I make myself
                    clear?
          
                              FINCH
                    Yes, sir.
          
                              LEADER
                    I believe in a few things, Mr.
                    Finch.  I believe in god.  I
                    believe in the destiny of the
                    Nordic race.  And I believe in
                    fascism.  The romans invented
                    fascism.  They had a symbol for it;
                    a bundle of twigs bound together. 
                    One twig could be broken but a
                    bundle would prevail.  That is the
                    heart and soul of fascism. 
                    Strength in unity.  I tell you
                    these things knowing full well that
                    they make you uncomfortable.
          
                              FINCH
                    Well, I...
          
                              LEADER
                    You have in fact expressed your
                    discomfort in several arrest
                    reports, arrests that were, in your
                    opinion, "unnecessary."  The fact
                    that you are here, that you are not
                    rotting in a prison cell, is a mark
                    of my respect and admiration for
                    you, for your craft, and for what
                    you have done for this country.
          
          Finch looks at the ground.
          
                              LEADER
                    It is also because I know you,
                    Finch.  I know what you are. 
                    You're a man like me.  A man who
                    understands when they are given a
                    job what must be done.  I
                    understand you, Finch, and that is
                    why I can trust you.
          
          He moves in close to Finch.
          
                              LEADER
                    This terrorist knows us, Finch. 
                    These attacks are perfectly
                    calculated and they are divisive. 
                    He knows what he's doing, Finch. 
                    He knows us all too well.
          
                              FINCH
                    You think he's an insider?
          
                              LEADER
                    What I think is that this man must
                    be stopped.  Stopped at all costs
                    and no one, I repeat, no one is to
                    be placed above suspicion.  Do I
                    make myself clear?
          
                              FINCH
                    Perfectly.
          
                              LEADER
                    England prevails, Mr. Finch.
          
                              FINCH
                    England prevails.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          Evey, alone in the Shadow Gallery, stares up at the
          inscription above the crooked staircase.
          
                              EVEY
                    V, v, v, v, v.
          
                              V
                    I hear your summons, my lady.  And
                    obey.
          
          She jumps, V suddenly appearing behind her.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh, V, you scared me.
          
          She turns back to the carving.
          
                              EVEY
                    I was reading the inscription. 
                    What is it?
          
                              V
                    A Latin quotation.  A motto.  "Vi
                    veri veniversum vivus vici."  "By
                    the power of truth, I, while
                    living, have conquered the
                    universe."
          
          She nods.
          
                              EVEY
                    Yes, I suppose you have.  This
                    place is the only universe I have
                    right now.
          
                              V
                    Does that bother you?
          
                              EVEY
                    I don't know.  I'm so grateful to
                    you -- I just feel I should help
                    you, you know, the way you're
                    helping me.  I mean, that's the
                    deal, isn't it?
          
          V drifts over to the big old Wurlitzer, fingers scanning the
          song list.
          
                              V
                    No deals, Evey.  Not unless you
                    want them.
          
          She looks up at the inscription as an old blues song begins
          to play.
          
                              EVEY
                    I think I do.  Part of me wants to
                    stay here forever and never have to
                    face what's going on outside.  But
                    that's not right.  Is it?  That's
                    not taking responsibility.  Not
                    conquering my universe.
          
          She turns to him.
          
                              EVEY
                    I want to help you, V.  I want to
                    do something.  Can we make a deal?
          
                              V
                    Yes.  I think we can make a deal if
                    you like.  I think I know a way you
                    could help me very soon indeed.
          
          Evey smiles nervously.
          
                              EVEY
                    Good.  That's that, then.
          
          The blues song curls in the air around them like a heavy
          incense.
          
                              EVEY
                    V, you said that Latin thing was a
                    quote.  Who said it?
          
                              V
                    Nobody you'd have heard of.  A
                    German gentleman named Dr. John
                    Faust.
          
          He spins her.
          
                              V
                    He made a deal too.
          
          EXT.  WESTMINSTER ABBEY - DAY
          
          The church doors have opened with the flow of parishioners as
          the final mass of the day has ended.
          
          The tide slowly pours out onto the sidewalk, separating
          around the clumps of people that conglomerate to network and
          gossip.
          
          Church bells toll in the orange dusk above them.
          
          Helen Heyer, a woman whose spite and guile are hidden behind
          her looks and clothes she drapes them with, charges into the
          gossipers, her trophy husband in tow, a timid looking man
          that we recognize as Conrad Heyer.
          
                              CONRAD
                    Hello, Rosemary.  Derek, how --
          
          Helen's head snaps over at the mention of the name.
          
                              HELEN
                    Derek!
          
          She pushes past Conrad, giving Derek Almond an exuberant kiss
          on both cheeks.
          
                              HELEN
                    Darling, how are you?  Hello,
                    Rosemary.
          
          Always behind her husband, Rosemary Almond smiles nervously
          as she straightens her drab church dress.
          
                              ROSEMARY
                    Hello.
          
                              DEREK
                    It's so good to see you.  Since
                    this bloody terrorist business, the
                    old man has me literally chained to
                    the office.
          
          Helen pouts at him.
          
                              HELEN
                    Oh, you poor dear.
          
          Derek taps the bottom of his cigarette box, drawing one with
          his lips.
          
                              DEREK
                    It comes with the job.  How are
                    things in the Eye, Conrad?
          
                              CONRAD
                    Well, we've been working some bugs
                    out of the new Mark IX fiber optic
                    network, actually --
          
                              HELEN
                    Oh, Conrad, don't be such a bloody
                    bore.  Do tell us about the
                    terrorist, Derek.  Is it true he
                    blew up Big Ben and the old Bailey?
          
                              DEREK
                    I'm afraid so.  We're dealing with
                    a pathological psychotic in the
                    most extreme case.  We'll catch him
                    though.  I promise.
          
          Helen rubs her white sable against her body.
          
                              HELEN
                    Oh, it sounds dreadfully exciting. 
                    Aren't you glad you've got such a
                    ruthless, implacable brute for a
                    husband, Rosemary?
          
                              ROSEMARY
                    Yes, well --
          
                              HELEN
                    Believe me, you're lucky.  You
                    could be struck with a professional
                    peeping tom like Conrad.  England's
                    highest paid voyeur, aren't you
                    darling?
          
                              CONRAD
                    Helen, I think we'd better --
          
                              HELEN
                    Oh yes, of course.  We have to get
                    back so the little pervert can
                    watch what the neighbors do after
                    Sunday lunch.  He's so exciting.
          
          Derek laughs as they climb into their car.
          
                              HELEN
                    Ciao!
          
                              DEREK
                    Goodbye, Helen.  Conrad.
          
          Rosemary waves as it pulls off.
          
                              ROSEMARY
                    She's a bit hard on him, isn't she?
          
          Derek sneers at her.
          
                              DEREK
                    Until you're half the woman of
                    Helen's sophistication, I'd keep
                    your little mouth shut.
          
          He throws the cigarette at her feet.
          
                              DEREK
                    Really, just look at the way you
                    dress.
          
          INT.  WESTMINSTER ABBEY
          
          From above, a hand sweeps aside the red plush curtain.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    Ah, there they go.  My happy and
                    contented flock.  Spiritually
                    refreshed and ready to face the
                    world again.
          
          Bishop Anthony Lilliman is a slender man of pious elegance
          with a warm, beautiful smile.
          
          He turns from the window to his valet, Dennis, as Derek and
          Rosemary get in their car.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    Did you enjoy the sermon today,
                    Dennis?
          
                              DENNIS
                    Very inspiring, your grace.  Though
                    the segue of the forces of Satan
                    among us did strike me as a bit of
                    a curious digression.
          
          He whisks a lint brush over the Bishop's robes before putting
          them away.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    Hmm, yes.  A trifle purple, I
                    thought.  Still, Fate wanted it
                    included and who are we to question
                    the will of the almighty, miserable
                    sinners that we are?
          
          A gentle smile spreads across his mouth.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    And speaking of sin, I wonder which
                    of the seven deadlies the good lord
                    will see fit to tempt me with
                    today.
          
          Dennis finishes with the Bishop's robes and sweeps the closet
          door shut.
          
                              DENNIS
                    Perhaps pride, your grace.
          
          Lilliman chuckles.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    I was thinking of something a
                    little less ethereal.  Has the
                    young lady arrived?
          
                              DENNIS
                    The agency informed me she'll be
                    here directly.  However, there was
                    a mixup.  It's not one of the usual
                    girls.  She's a little older.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    Oh dear.  Oh dear.  Not too old, I
                    trust?
          
                              DENNIS
                    They promise me she's no more than
                    fifteen.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    Fifteen, hmm.
          
          The Bishop rubs his cheek, ponderously.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    Ah well, if Job could bear his
                    disappointments, I suppose I must
                    have the good grace to bear mine. 
                    Show her in when she arrives.
          
                              DENNIS
                    Yes, your grace.
          
          EXT.  WESTMINSTER ABBEY - NIGHT
          
          A pair of headlights melt through the heavy night's fog as a
          taxicab pulls into the circle drive.
          
          INT.  BISHOP'S QUARTERS
          
          Dennis peers into the Bishop's living quarters.
          
                              DENNIS
                    The young lady, your grace.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    Oh my!
          
          Standing next to Dennis is Evey, wearing a frilly pink summer
          dress, pigtails and bows and white ruffled socks.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    And to think I doubted your
                    loveliness for even an instant. 
                    Mea culpa, my child, mea culpa. 
                    You are a vision.  An angel.
          
          Evey smiles awkwardly.
          
                              EVEY
                    Uh... thank you.
          
          EXT.  WESTMINSTER ABBEY - NIGHT
          
          A shadow begins moving across the manicured grounds borne on
          the thick mist like a dark phantom.  V glides toward the
          rectory, cloak undulating against the dark, wet wind.
          
          INT.  BISHOP'S BEDROOM
          
          It is extravagantly furnished, somewhere between posh and
          pimp.  The Bishop is sitting very close to Evey on his plush
          water bed.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    Of course, "hate the sin, love the
                    sinner."  I always say.  Take your
                    dress off, please.
          
          Evey stammers, backing up along the bedside.
          
                              EVEY
                    Listen -- I was kind of hoping --
          
          He paws at her, groping hands pushing the front of her dress
          down as she backs up against the nightstand.
          
                              EVEY
                    No --
          
          EXT.  MAIN GATE - NIGHT
          
          The guards look out into the night, fear suddenly gripping
          their faces.
          
          V emerges demonically through the parting veils of fog, the
          white smiling mask bobbing eerily up and down as he rushes
          them.
          
          A cigarette drops from the first guard's mouth, red embers
          exploding when it hits the wet cement.
          
          Close as the two guards claw for their arms and the white hot
          flash of V's knives --
          
          That slice like talons.
          
          The two men crumple to the ground, clutching their gaping,
          gurgling wounds.  A whisper.  V sprints into the courtyard.
          
          INT.  BISHOP'S BEDROOM
          
          Evey grabs a metal table lamp and swings it down on the
          Bishop's head.  There is a shuddering clank and he collapses
          to the floor.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    You -- You filthy whore!
          
          His blood speckles the white bearskin throw rug as the Bishop
          slowly rises after the retreating Evey.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    I'll kill you, you fucking sow.
          
          He charges after her but freezes dead in his tracks as V
          swings around the corner in front of him.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    What's this?  Who --
          
                              V
                    Please allow me to introduce
                    myself...
          
          V bows.
          
                              V
                    I'm a man of wealth and taste.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    Dennis?
          
          Instantly, the point of one of V's knives is against the
          Bishop's throat.  V presses a finger to his frozen smile.
          
                              V
                    Shh.  It isn't polite to disturb
                    the dead on their journey.
          
          Evey watches from around the corner.
          
                              V
                    A courtesy I'll most respectfully
                    extend to his grace.
          
                              EVEY
                    V?
          
          Lilliman swallows audibly.
          
                              EVEY
                    V, what are you doing?
          
                              V
                    Vi veri veniversum vivus vici,
                    Evey.
          
          Evey looks down at the knives on his belt, dripping blood.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh no.
          
          She begins backing to the door.
          
                              EVEY
                    You can't kill him!
          
                              V
                    Death has followed his grace the
                    whole of his career.  Is it any
                    coincidence it has finally followed
                    him here?
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh god, V.  I can't -- I can't --
          
          V turns back to Lilliman as Evey runs.
          
                              V
                    Let us pray.
          
          EXT.  WESTMINSTER ABBEY - NIGHT
          
          Evey sprints past the dead guards at the man gate and into
          the fog.
          
          INT.  THE EAR
          
          A cramped control room that looks like something between a
          radio and television switching room, though it does not
          broadcast.  It receives.
          
          Two operators sit at the main substation as the sounds of
          lovemaking come over the speakers.  The moans are stifled and
          low, however, as if they were afraid someone was listening.
          
                              OPERATOR 1
                    Bloody hell.  Doesn't anybody fuck
                    with feeling anymore?
          
          Operator 2 does not look at him, scrolling through an
          intricate city map on his computer.
          
                              OPERATOR 2
                    Hey, it's Sunday.  Children's hour
                    over at the Abbey.
          
                              OPERATOR 1
                    Let's see what that filthy old
                    pervert is up to.
          
          Operator 1 punches in some coordinates and the sound over the
          speakers changes to a garbled fart of noise.  Two voices
          drown beneath a cacophony of classical music.
          
                              OPERATOR 1
                    What the --
          
          He tries to dial out the background and suddenly the voices
          rise clearly above the din.
          
                              VOICE 1
                    ... And I saw a black shape against
                    the flames.  Oh god.  It's you. 
                    The man from room five.  You've
                    come --
          
                              VOICE 2
                    To collect what's mine.
          
                              VOICE 1
                    I beg you!  I don't want to die! 
                    Please have mercy!
          
          The two men look at each other, Operator 1 lunging for a red
          phone.
          
                              OPERATOR 1
                    Get me the Finger.  This is an
                    emergency!
          
          EXT.  BISHOP'S QUARTERS - NIGHT
          
          Close on a stain of white vomit and blood on the thick pile
          of a Persian rug.  It is encircled in police chalk.
          
          Pull back to reveal the chalk outline where the body of
          Bishop Lilliman was found.  The circled bloodstain floats
          above the head like the last word balloon of a crude comic
          strip character.
          
          The Bishop's quarters is slowly being picked over by a
          forensic team from the Nose.  A photographer's flash bursts
          against a painted "V" on the wall near the body outline.
          
          At the window, Finch chews on his pipe, staring at a plastic
          evidence bag that contains a single violet carson rose.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    No prints yet, sir.  Just like
                    Prothero.
          
                              FINCH
                    I want those tapes from the Ear in
                    my office tonight, Dominic.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Yes, sir.  They're on top of it.
          
          Finch turns to a muscular man named Creedy, second in command
          at the Finger.
          
                              FINCH
                    Any word from your superior, Mr.
                    Creedy?
          
                              CREEDY
                    Mr. Almond doesn't seem to be
                    answering his page, sir.  I'm sure
                    he's in the field.
          
                              FINCH
                    Quite.
          
          INT.  CONRAD HEYER'S BEDROOM
          
          Grunting like an animal, Derek's face is frozen, locked in
          the rigor of a violent orgasm.  After a moment, he collapses
          beside Helen onto the sweat soaked sheets.
          
                              HELEN
                    There you go, baby.  Now my baby
                    boy can think so much clearer. 
                    Can't he?
          
          She grabs her cigarette case and her lighter.
          
                              HELEN
                    You have been thinking, haven't
                    you?
          
          She straddles his chest then lights two cigarettes.
          
                              HELEN
                    I know you have.  Ever since this
                    terrorist appeared.
          
          He smiles as she puts one of the cigarettes in his mouth.
          
                              HELEN
                    Oh jesus, that smile.  That smile
                    turns me on like nothing else.
          
          She whispers in his ear.
          
                              HELEN
                    Tell me.  Tell me what's going on
                    in that ruthless sadistic brain of
                    yours.
          
                              DEREK
                    Everyone is so worried about the
                    terrorist.  Especially Susan.  You
                    know why?  Because nobody knows
                    what he's going to do.
          
          He exhales through his grinding teeth.
          
                              DEREK
                    If I were him, I know what I'd do.
          
          He whispers.
          
                              DEREK
                    I'd blow that fat bastard to
                    kingdom come.
          
          Helen bolts up.
          
                              HELEN
                    No.  You're kidding.
          
                              DEREK
                    Am I?
          
          He smiles, blowing more smoke.
          
                              DEREK
                    There's an old train line under the
                    New Government Building.  It
                    collapsed when they poured the
                    foundation.  You could haul in
                    enough TNT to launch our Leader's
                    ass all the way to the moon.
          
          Helen's eyes gleam as he laughs.
          
                              HELEN
                    You're serious, aren't you?
          
          He eyes her sucking on the cigarette.
          
                              DEREK
                    You need to be careful, Helen. 
                    Your mouth is going to get you into
                    trouble one day.
          
                              HELEN
                    Is that the same trouble you love
                    putting in my mouth?
          
                              DEREK
                    You never know who might be
                    listening.
          
                               HELEN
                    I know, Derek.  You love your
                    country and you love your party,
                    just like you love your wife.
          
          He glares at her.
          
                              HELEN
                    Derek.  I'm sorry.  I know I can be
                    a bitch.  But that's why you're
                    here, isn't it?
          
          He smiles again and she presses her body to his.
          
                              HELEN
                    This is it, isn't it, Derek?  What
                    we've been waiting for.  At last,
                    you'll be rid of Susan.  I'll be
                    rid of Conrad.  And we'll be free. 
                    Free, won't we?
          
          His eyes close as he grinds his hips into hers and we rise,
          drifting up to the ceiling light fixture --
          
          Where we see a tiny hidden microphone.
          
          INT.  FINCH'S OFFICE - THE NOSE
          
          Finch sits at his desk, staring into the silence of his
          notepad.  He has doodled a little "V" with a circle around
          it.
          
          He looks up as Dominic enters, holding up a portable cassette
          player.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Sorry it took so long.  The boys
                    had a devil of a time trying to
                    filter out the background noise.
          
                              FINCH
                    Background noise?
          
                              DOMINIC
                    The perpetrator apparently turned
                    on the Bishop's stereo. 
                    Subsequently, a great deal of the
                    tape is useless.
          
          He hands the player to Finch.
          
                              FINCH
                    What music did he play?
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Beethoven.  The fifth, I believe.
          
          Finch smiles.
          
                              FINCH
                    Da, da, da, dum.  That's code. 
                    Morse code.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Sir?
          
                              FINCH
                    For the letter "V".
          
          Finch punches "play".
          
          Over the small speaker, we sear Evey protesting to V, then
          run.  He stops it.
          
                              FINCH
                    Anything on the girl yet?
          
                              DOMINIC
                    No.  The agency said somebody
                    claiming to be Lilliman's valet
                    canceled his Sunday appointment.
          
          Finch starts it again and this time the tape is very fuzzy.
          
                              FINCH
                    What is it?
          
                              DOMINIC
                    23rd Psalm.
          
          We recognize some of the words though muted and crackly.
          
                              TAPE (V.O.)
                    Though I walk through the valley of
                    the shadow of death...
          
                              DOMINIC
                    It goes on like that for a while. 
                    Fairly incoherent except we could
                    make out a few words in this part. 
                    Transubstantiation.
          
          Finch nods, understanding.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    That miracle business when the
                    wafer transform into the body of
                    Christ.
          
                              FINCH
                    He made him eat a host.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Yes, listen to this part.
          
          The tape becomes somewhat clearer as the music rests.
          
                              TAPE (V.O.)
                    ... And at the moment this enters
                    your mouth it becomes the flesh of
                    the savior?  Yes... please... And
                    whatever it is made of now it will
                    become the body of Christ?  Yes...
                    yes...
          
          They eye each other.
          
                              TAPE (V.O.)
                    I want you to swallow it.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    There's a couple of funny human
                    noises...
          
                              FINCH
                    And then just Beethoven's fifth.
          
          He shuts off the tape.
          
                              FINCH
                    We have got the initial path report
                    back.  The host was full of
                    cyanide.
          
          Finch picks up the bag with the violet carson.
          
                              FINCH
                    And do you know what?
          
          He rises, sliding into his jacket.
          
                              FINCH
                    When it reached his abdomen, it was
                    still cyanide.
          
          INT.  MORGUE
          
          Close on the heavy stitching of a "Y" incision sewn into the
          chest of a corpse.  It is one of the Bishop's guards.
          
                              DELIA
                    Do you have a motive?
          
          Finch is standing next to the cadaver gurney with the
          coroner, Delia Surridge.  She is a serious woman, hair wound
          tight behind her head in a severe bun.
          
                              DELIA
                    I mean, was anything taken?
          
          She fills the dead man's head with cotton and replaces the
          top of his skull.
          
                              FINCH
                    Just lives.
          
          Pulling at the man's scalp, she stretches it over the
          replaced skull piece.
          
                              FINCH
                    I know it's too early for your
                    profile but do you have any initial
                    impressions?
          
                              DELIA
                    Well...
          
          She points at a jagged puncture wound at the base of the
          man's sternum with a ball point pen.
          
                              DELIA
                    He's incredibly powerful.  This
                    man's sternum was split like dry
                    wood from the base all the way up
                    to the manubrium.
          
          Finch peers into the hole.
          
                              DELIA
                    And he's resourceful.  On that
                    table behind you is a breakdown of
                    all the chemicals found in
                    Prothero's blood stream.
          
          Finch hefts the pile of computer paper.

                    There were hundreds of different
                    chemicals in him.  From
                    trinitrotoluene to estrogen to
                    motor oil.
          
          He flips through the document, biting into the wooden end of
          his pipe.

                    Perhaps Fate will make something
                    more of all this.  I certainly
                    can't.

                    The Leader finally authorized an
                    uplink for you?  He must be getting
                    nervous.
          
                              FINCH
                    Quite.  Government directed
                    terrorism never sews healthy ideas
                    into the public.  Oh, that reminds
                    me.
          
          Finch pulls the evidence bag from his pocket.
          
                              FINCH
                    Can you tell us anything about
                    this?
          
          Delia's eyes lock onto the violet carson.
          
                              FINCH
                    We found one in the carriage with
                    Prothero and this one in the
                    Bishop's quarters.  A violet
                    carson.
          
          He hands it to her.
          
                              FINCH
                    I heard that strain had died off. 
                    Thought a botanist might shed some
                    light on it.  Delia?
          
          Delia, riveted to the rose, suddenly looks up to him.
          
                              DELIA
                    Yes -- Yes, of course.
          
                              FINCH
                    Magic.  I'll drop by tomorrow then.
          
          He turns, leaving her with the rose.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          V relaxes with a book in an overstuffed reading chair, a
          violet carson rose resting on a table next to him.  He begins
          to read a passage aloud.
          
                              V
                    "There is more behind and inside of
                    V than any of us had suspected. 
                    Not who, but what: what is she?"
          
          He places the book down.  Thomas Pynchon's "V".
          
          V rises, lifting the rose and moving into the darkness of the
          Shadow Gallery.
          
          EXT.  EMPTY STREET
          
          A small figure moves down the dark wet street, the
          cobblestones glistening like black scales.
          
          The huddled figure arcs across the street in the shadows,
          avoiding the pools of streetlight.  It is Evey, a frightened
          look on her face.
          
          INT.  KITTY KAT KELLER
          
          A woman in combat boots, fishnets, and a tight fitting
          soldier's uniform is in the middle of a cheeky number on
          stage in this smoky burlesque bar.  It is a popular place
          with locals and Fingermen.
          
          Peter Creedy squeezes through the crowd, angling for the back
          of the bar where a number of loud Fingermen are drinking.
          
                              CREEDY
                    What's all this, then, Harper?  I
                    get a radio that a man's down and
                    in need of assistance?
          
                              HARPER
                    I ain't gone down yet but I sure do
                    need some assistance.
          
          Creedy leans in.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Are you flat broke already?
          
          They break up in laughter, led by Creedy who sits next to
          Harper, pouring himself a drink.
          
                              LOUT
                    How'd you sneak away, Creedy? 
                    Almond off buggering that blonde
                    chippy?
          
                              HARPER
                    The one with the tits?
          
          They all begin to hoot and whistle.
          
                              CREEDY
                    What I wouldn't give for a piece of
                    that.
          
                              LOUT
                    She could serve a tray of drinks on
                    those thingies.
          
                              HARPER
                    I bet you get your chance with her
                    sooner than later, Creedy, with the
                    way Almond's crackin' up.
          
                              LOUT
                    Bloody bugger's losing his marbles.

                    Terrorist or no, if that bastard
                    gives me another double shift, I'll
                    stomp his fucking head.
          
          Creedy raises his drink.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Aye.  This nonsense has put a
                    serious strain on my drinking.  I
                    think I was actually sober today.
          
                              LOUT
                    I'll drink to that.
          
                              HARPER
                    We need to get a real man of the
                    people in that director's position. 
                    Like Creedy here.
          
          Everyone cheers in agreement.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Well, it's good to know when the
                    shit hits the fan who your real
                    friends are.
          
          They salute and drink.

          Derek Almond sits hunched under a desk lamp, pumping the
          cylinders of his revolver with a wire brush.
          
          Rosemary shuffles up to him, her frumpy gown gathered around
          her.

          He blows down one of the cylinders, not looking up.
          
                              DEREK
                    I don't want to hear it, Rosemary.

          Derek stares at the gun, rage building.

                    eat with me.  You don't have sex --
          
          Derek leaps up, slugging her.
          
          Rosemary clatters to the ground in tears.  Derek glowering
          over her.

                    riding me all day.  I don't want to

                    gob!
          
          He leans into her face.
          
                              DEREK
                    And me not wanting to fuck you is
                    obvious.  Take a look at yourself.
          
          He sits back in front of the gun, wiping it down.
          
                              DEREK
                    Get out of my sight.  I'm cleaning

          filtering in from the open curtains.
          
          Her eyes fixed on the violet carson as she slowly turns it
          over in her hands, fingers tracing the soft petals.
          
          After a moment, she stands, letting it fall from her lap.

                    Most of Larkhill's records were
                    destroyed for security reasons but

          a light, uneasy sleep.
          
          Suddenly, an eye pops open as she awakens, catching a
          familiar scent.  She slowly sits up and inhales.

                    Relieved.

                    Oh god, all these years.  All this
                    waiting.  And somehow I always knew

          Delia thinks back.
          
                              DELIA
                    When I saw you that night -- the

                    standing against the flames and you
                    looked straight at me.
          
          The mask almost nods.

                    I knew then that one day you'd come
                    looking for me, that you'd find me.
          
          Her voice drops to an almost confessional whisper.
          
                              DELIA
                    What -- what happened at Larkhill. 
                    What we did -- What I did.  That
                    terrible knowledge, it's been with
                    me so long.  That I could do things
                    like that.
          
          Delia rubs the salty tears from her eyes.
          
                              DELIA
                    For years, I blamed it on the
                    government, on the authority I
                    could never stand up to.  But
                    living so long with the knowledge
                    of what I did has made me
                    understand otherwise.  I alone was
                    accountable.
          
          V watches her.
          
                              DELIA
                    There is something wrong with us. 
                    With all of mankind.  With me. 
                    Something evil that made me enjoy
                    what I did.  Some hideous flaw.
          
          Her voice almost trails off.
          
                              DELIA
                    We deserve to be culled.  We
                    deserve it.
          
          INT.  ALMOND BEDROOM
          
          Light sweeps across Rosemary from the opening bedroom door as
          she sobs softly in bed.  Derek enters, holding a bottle of
          whiskey and his clean gun.
          
          She sits up as Derek looms over her.
          
                              ROSEMARY
                    Derek?  What?
          
          He lifts the gun into her bruised face.  Her eyebrows cringe
          as he slowly pulls the trigger.
          
                              DEREK
                    Bang.
          
          Click.  It is empty.
          
                              DEREK
                    Don't worry, Rose.  I didn't load
                    it.
          
          The phone rings.
          
                              DEREK
                    Not tonight.
          
          He grins evilly at her and answers the bedside phone.
          
                              DEREK
                    Almond.  What?!  Where?
          
          Derek's drunk eyes light up.
          
                              DEREK
                    Oh god, yes!  God, thank you!
          
          He slams the phone down, charging out of the room.
          
          EXT.  KITTY KAT KELLER
          
          A gaggle of drunks exit the bar, laughing and singing as they
          pass a small figure.
          
          INT.  KITTY KAT KELLER
          
          Evey wanders into the bar amidst the lustful screams and cat
          calls for the line of high stepping, semi-clothed girls on
          stage.
          
          She stares out into the crowd, not sure why she is here when
          a man approaches her: Creedy.  His sloppy smile indicates he
          has had a few drinks.
          
                              CREEDY
                    You look lost.
          
          She looks blankly at him.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Can I buy you a drink?
          
                              EVEY
                    No... I made a mistake.
          
          She turns for the door.
          
                              EVEY
                    I have to find someone.
          
          Creedy frowns as his radio crackles.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Well I didn't like the looks of you
                    anyway --

                    All units, all units.  Code red.

                    codename V.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Bloody hell!
          
          He screams to the Fingermen at the back.
          
                              CREEDY
                    It's him!  We got him!
          
          Evey watches as they storm out of the bar, then follows.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          The emergency lights blaring, Finch's car squeals around a
          corner.
          
          INT.  DELIA SURRIDGE'S BEDROOM
          
          V hovers ghostly at Delia's bedside.
          
                              DELIA
                    It's funny, I was given one of your
                    roses today.  I wasn't sure you
                    were the terrorist until I saw it.
          
          She manages a smile.
          
                              DELIA
                    What a strange coincidence.  That I
                    should be given it today.
          
                              V
                    There are no coincidences, Delia. 
                    Only the illusion of coincidence.
          
          He reaches into his cloak.
          
                              V
                    I have another rose.  This one is
                    for you.
          
          He hands it to her.
          
                              DELIA
                    Then you are going to kill me now?
          
          V produces an empty syringe.
          
                              V
                    I killed you ten minutes ago. 
                    While you slept.
          
                              DELIA
                    Is there any pain?
          
          V sits on the bed.
          
                              V
                    No.  No pain.
          
                              DELIA
                    Thank you.
          
          She stares at the mask.
          
                              DELIA
                    Can I -- Can I see your face again?
          
          V slowly pulls off his hat and lifts his mask.  Delia stares
          into his face.
          
                              DELIA
                    It's beautiful...
          
          The rose falls from her hands.
          
          INT.  HALL
          
          V quietly shuts the door as if not to wake her and turns just
          as --
          
          Derek Almond reaches the top of the stairs.
          
                              DEREK
                    Don't move an inch, you bloody
                    bastard.
          
          He trains his gun.
          
                              DEREK
                    You didn't hear me arrive, did you? 
                    Didn't know we'd rumbled you?
          
          He squints.
          
                              DEREK
                    It's all finished, chummy.  All of
                    it.  The old man told me it was my
                    head or yours and what do you know. 
                    It's yours.
          
          The smiling mask stares.
          
                              DEREK
                    Because you're standing over there
                    with your bloody stupid knives and
                    your fancy karate gimmicks --
          
          Derek pulls back the hammer.
          
                              DEREK
                    And I've got a gun.
          
          He smiles.
          
                              DEREK
                    Bang.
          
          Click.  He never loaded it.
          
          There is an awkward moment of silence, then V moves --
          
          Cloak opening, filling the hall like a black tidal wave that
          envelopes Derek.  He chokes a scream as V embraces him,
          slipping a knife above his floating rib.
          
          Derek Almond sputters as he claws at V's mask.
          
                              DEREK
                    Who -- Who are you?
          
                              V
                    Yes, look.  Look and tell me what
                    you see.
          
          He rips V's mask off as V thrusts the knife in deeper.
          
          Derek's eyes widen in horror as his life pours out the knife
          wound.
          
                              DEREK
                    Horrible!  God, it's horrible!
          
          V jerks his blade free, letting Derek slip to the ground.
          
          EXT.  DELIA SURRIDGE'S HOME
          
          Finch's car bucks up onto the sidewalk.
          
          Finch and Dominic tear out of the car and barrel into the
          house.
          
          INT.  DELIA SURRIDGE'S HOME
          
          At the top of the stairs, they find the dead Derek.  Finch
          rushes past him for the bedroom.
          
                              FINCH
                    Delia?
          
          Inside, he finds her.  Her eyes fixed, cold, and dead, a
          single violet carson in her lap.
          
                              FINCH
                    Get an ambulance.
          
          EXT.  DELIA SURRIDGE'S HOME
          
          Evey rushes around a corner to see a crime scene bathed in
          siren light.  She pushes up to the police barricade as the
          M.E.'s load a draped body into their van.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh no... V?
          
          She tries to angle around to get a better look when a man in
          a brown overcoat grabs her from behind and drags her into the
          alley.
          
          INT.  DELIA SURRIDGE'S BEDROOM
          
          From the corner of the room, Finch sits, watching as the
          M.E.'s wheel out Delia's body.
          
          Dominic squeezes past the gurney and crosses toward Finch.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    I'm sorry, sir.  You knew the
                    doctor pretty well?
          
          Finch nods.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    We found this on her bureau, sir. 
                    It's Dr. Surridge's journal.  It
                    covers her years at Larkhill.  It
                    might contain the whole story.
          
          Dominic searches for something more to say when Finch does
          not answer.
          
          After a moment, Finch looks at the book in Dominic's hand,
          then takes it, leafing through the pages.  They flip by, a
          breathy sigh, rising to a cold wind.

                    Prothero has hand picked my

                    of which will be any use to me if I
                    don't get to work soon.
          
          She finishes an injection, Prothero encouraging the next
          subject.  We recognize her as the woman Prothero pointed at.

                    myself hating them.
          
          Delia prepares the next dose, a sour look on her face.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    They don't fight or struggle.  Just
                    stare at you with weak eyes.

                    Strangely, no clear patterns have

                    discernible effect on any specific
                    group though the men seem slightly
                    more resilient than the women.
          
          When it is full, they move to the next door until the cart is

                    I'm hoping the survivors will
                    provide more answers or my time

                    The man in room five is a
                    fascinating case.
          
          She looks through the small chicken wire glass window in the
          door.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    Physically, there doesn't seem to
                    be anything wrong with him.  No
                    cellular anomalies, nothing.
          
          In the back, just on the edge of the room's shadow, sits the
          man in room five, silently staring back.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    Batch five, however, seems to have
                    brought on some kind of psychotic
                    breakdown.  He's quite insane.
          
          Dr. Surridge can't seem to break her stare.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    He has this way of looking through
                    you.  Reverend Lilliman won't go
                    near him.  He claims that it is the
                    devil in room five.  I see him
                    cross himself whenever he passes
                    his door.  Still, there's something
                    about him...
          
          EXT.  LARKHILL GARDEN - DAY - FLASHBACK
          
          Dr. Surridge slowly moves through the Larkhill garden, an
          incredible abundance of fruits, vegetables and violet carson
          roses.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    I'm glad Prothero let room five
                    have a go at the gardening project. 
                    He is quite proficient.  Prothero
                    was reluctant to allow an inmate
                    access to the tool and chemical
                    supply at first but now the fat
                    toad is delighted.  The crop has
                    almost doubled.
          
          She traces the petals of a rose with her finger.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    He also grows roses.  Beautiful
                    roses.
          
          INT.  LARKHILL LOUNGE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
          
          Dr. Surridge and several other Larkhill appointees relax
          after dinner.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    December 24th: I was in the mess. 
                    It was about half past ten when we
                    heard the first explosion.
          
          A massive explosion shakes the building to its very core, its
          windows shattering and hooded pendulum lights swinging.
          
          EXT.  LARKHILL LOUNGE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
          
          Men and women clutch at their throats as they tumble out into
          the yard.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    The ones at the front ran straight
                    into the gas.  It was horrible.
          
          They drop to the ground, gasping and vomiting.
          
          The back door is kicked open, Dr. Surridge following two
          guards.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    A few of us made it out through the
                    rear door.  You could hear men
                    screaming everywhere.  I hate the
                    sound of men screaming.
          
          She looks out, men running, collapsing, dying in a yellow
          green haze that seems everywhere.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    In the center of the camp,
                    everything was on fire.  Everyone
                    running in all directions.  We had
                    hardly enough time to get our
                    bearings when the ovens exploded.
          
          Another explosion wracks the compound.  The pillar of flame
          rises into the black sky, dwarfing the men in the camp.
          
          Dr. Surridge sees a gaping hole in the medical block, its
          insides turned out like an unholy birth.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    It was the man in room rive.  I
                    couldn't have known.  The chemical
                    supplies, grease solvents, ammonia,
                    fertilizer.  He'd been making
                    things with them.
          
          Close on a soldier, doubled over, hacking up bile.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    Mustard gas...
          
          A sticky blue fire licks up from a blackened body like a dura
          flame.
          
                              DELIA
                    And napalm.
          
          Dr. Surridge turns as a silhouette crosses the yard, backlit
          by a curtain of fire.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    And in the yard, I saw him.  He had
                    the flames behind him.  He was
                    naked.
          
          The man stops.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    He looked at me...
          
          Dr. Surridge seems to wilt under his stare but cannot look
          away.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    As if I were an insect.  Oh god. 
                    As if I were something mounted on a
                    slide.
          
          The flames convulse hypnotically behind him.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    He looked at me.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE
          
          Finch snaps Dr. Surridge's journal shut.
          
          He sits in front of the Leader's desk puffing on his pipe
          while Susan stares coldly.
          
                              FINCH
                    That's the last entry until six
                    months later when Dr. Surridge is
                    back in London.  There is no
                    mention of the man in room five
                    again.  End of story.
          
          He tosses the journal on Susan's desk.
          
                              FINCH
                    Except that it wasn't the end of
                    the story.
          
          Finch rises, crossing to the wastebasket.
          
                              FINCH
                    Between 2009 and 2012, over forty
                    men and women who were previously
                    stationed at Larkhill met with what
                    were believed to be accidental
                    deaths.  Eventually, only three
                    remained.
          
          He taps his pipe into his hand, pouring the contents into the
          wastebasket.
          
                              FINCH
                    The three he'd been saving until
                    last.
          
          Finch brushes the ashes from his hands and begins repacking
          his pipe.
          
                              FINCH
                    Everyone who worked at Larkhill. 
                    Everyone who could have identified
                    him.  You see there are two
                    possible motives here.  Not one.
          
          Susan raises his head.
          
                              FINCH
                    The first is revenge.  He escapes
                    from Larkhill and vows to get even
                    with his tormentors.  The whole
                    exercise an elaborate, chilling
                    vendetta.
          
          When he finishes repacking the pipe, he replaces it in his
          mouth.
          
                              FINCH
                    That's the explanation that I find
                    most reassuring, funnily enough. 
                    Because that means he's finished. 
                    It's over now.
          
          Finch begins relighting his pipe.
          
                              FINCH
                    The second motive is more sinister. 
                    Like I said, everyone who could
                    have identified him is dead.
          
          A flame leaps into the air.
          
                              FINCH
                    What if he's just been clearing the
                    ground?
          
          Another burst.
          
                              FINCH
                    What if he's planning something
                    else?
          
          The lighter slips back into his pocket.
          
                              FINCH
                    You see, the diary we found was in
                    full view.  We didn't have to
                    search for it.  He left it there. 
                    He wanted us to find it.  He wanted
                    us to know the story.  Or...
          
          Finch returns to his chair, letting out a huge cloud.
          
                              FINCH
                    For all we know, the diary could be
                    a complete and utter fake. 
                    Codename V could have written it
                    himself.
          
          Finch leans forward.
          
                              FINCH
                    He's playing games with us.  He
                    might never have been at Larkhill
                    at all.  Do you see?  It could all
                    be another smoke screen, a false
                    trail, another cover story --
          
                              LEADER
                    Enough!
          
          Susan punches the desk.
          
                              LEADER
                    Mr. Finch, would you please explain
                    to me the nature of this meeting?! 
                    Because I was under the impression
                    that you had some information about
                    the terrorist, codename V!
          
          And punches it again until his fist hurts.
          
                              LEADER
                    No more questions, understand!  I
                    want answers!  I am not interested
                    in where he grew up, what kind of
                    flowers he likes or his favorite
                    color!
          
          Susan's collar chokes his face to an unnatural crimson.
          
                              LEADER
                    Do I make myself clear?
          
                              FINCH
                    Yes, Leader.
          
          After a moment, Finch stands, Susan hanging on his last word.
          
                              LEADER
                    Dismissed.  England prevails, Mr.
                    Finch.
          
          Finch turns, Susan calling after him as he leaves.
          
                              LEADER
                    Mr. Finch, the girl.  Do you have
                    anything on the girl?
          
          Finch pauses at the door.
          
                              FINCH
                    No, Leader.  Not yet.
          
          INT.  CELL
          
          Evey stirs as voices drift in from the hall outside her door.
          
                              MAN
                    Wake up, cow.
          
          Three guards are silhouetted in the doorway of a cramped jail
          cell.  Still sluggish from the chloroform, Evey looks down at
          the coarse slipover she's now wearing.
          
          One of the men, Rossiter, crosses toward Evey, swinging a
          pair of shackles.  He grabs Evey, slamming her face down into
          the hard cot, driving a knee between her shoulder blades.
          
          Evey screams.
          
                              GUARD 1
                    Tsk.  This pathetic whore is the
                    famous Miss Hammond?
          
          The shackles bite down on her wrists as they laugh in the
          hall.
          
                              EVEY
                    You've made a mistake.
          
          Rossiter stands her up, shoving her into the wall.
          
                              ROSSITER
                    Shut up.
          
                              EVEY
                    Please.  I haven't done anything --
          
          He slides a thick hood over her head.
          
                              ROSSITER
                    I said shut your hole!
          
          INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM
          
          The hood is lifted from her head.  Evey squints hard, awash
          in a blinding, burning light.
          
          A man sits, unmoving, at a desk across from her, a guard at
          his side, both backlit by a harsh white kliegs.
          
          Evey's eyes start to water as she blinks.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    Do you know why you're here.  Evey
                    Hammond?
          
                              EVEY
                    No, please, I didn't do anything.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    Allow me to be more precise.  Did
                    you participate in the murder of

                    Have you ever participated in a

                    I don't know.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    You are a lying cunt.
          
          A monitor next to the desk lights up.  From the snowy static,
          an image begins to form.
          
          A girl is talking to a man.  She is shoving her hips at him,
          propositioning him.  When more men appear from the alley,
          Evey realizes she is watching herself.
          
                              EVEY
                    They were going to rape me, kill
                    me --
          
          Rossiter grabs a handful of her hair.
          
                              ROSSITER
                    Shut up.
          
          She swallows hard when she sees V emerge on the screen.  The
          image freezes on his smiling face.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    This board will not tolerate any
                    more of your lies, Miss Hammond. 
                    We have over 120 minutes of audio
                    and videotape and 75 pages of
                    testimonials from eye witness that

                    the terrorist, codename V.
          
          The monitor blinks off.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    Do you want to know why you're
                    here?  You are formally being
                    brought up on charges of murder on
                    fourteen counts and sedition
                    against your Leader and country
                    which brings an automatic sentence
                    of death.
          
                              EVEY
                    Please.  I didn't do anything.

                    Process the prisoner and return her
                    to her cell until she is more
                    cooperative.
          
          Rossiter slips the hood back over Evey's head.
          
          INT.  PROCESSING ROOM
          
          Evey cries as a rough hand runs a pair of electric clippers
          over her head.  Huge sheaves of her hair fall to the ground.
          
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT.  CELL
          
          Evey lies crumpled on the hard floor, unmoving, as a tray of
          food is slid through a slot at the bottom of the door.
          
          She watches as a rat crosses from a hole in the wall,
          sniffing the murky rendered gelatin in the wooden bowl.
          
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

          Evey hangs limply from a set of manacles as she is washed and
          deloused by heavy hands.
          
          She coughs in the yellow bug powder cloud as it burns her
          eyes and the red welts on her back.
          
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT.  CELL
          
          Evey is curled up on the cot like a dry fetus, now gaunt arms
          wrapped around her legs.  She blinks when she hears something
          moving in the rat hole.
          
          Evey raises her head as something is pushed through the
          crevice.
          
          Tentative fingers search the hole, pulling out a length of
          toilet paper.  Over every inch of it is a delicately scrawled
          message.
          
          We move into the rathole, its edges slowly filling the frame
          until black.

          Pull back from a shadow, the outline of the interrogator's
          silhouette against sharp light coming into frame.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I read her letter.  Hid it.  Slept. 
                    Woke.  They questioned me.  And I
                    read her letter again.
          
          Rossiter is buckling Evey's thin arms and legs into a chair. 
          Her now frail frame can barely hold up the frayed brown
          slipover.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Over and over...
          
          On the table in front of her, there is a large wash basin of
          water.  Rossiter dunks her head into it.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Her name was Valerie.

          A teacher reads from her lesson plan in front of rows and
          rows of uniformed pubescences in this all girl private
          school.  Her voice drones on and on like Muzak.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    I was born in a rainy burg in
                    Nottingham in 1975.  I passed my
                    eleven plus and went to girl's
                    grammar.
          
          A blonde tomboy sneaks a smile to her curly haired friend
          next to her.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    I met my first girlfriend at
                    school.  Her name was Sara.  Her
                    wrists.  Her wrists were beautiful.
          
          Her hand slides across the desk, fingers tickling the young
          flesh of Sara's wrist.
          
          The teacher's voice slows, dropping octaves, becoming --
          
          INT.  BIOLOGY LAB - DAY - FLASHBACK
          
          A man's voice.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    I sat in biology class staring at
                    the pickled rabbit fetus while Mr.
                    Herd said it was an adolescent
                    phase that people outgrew.
          
          Valerie looks at Sara across the room, her head down in
          shame.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    Sara did.  I didn't.

          Two teenage girls stand in front of a middle aged couple. 
          They are holding hands.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    In 1994, I stopped pretending and
                    took a girl called Christine home
                    to meet my parents.
          
          The greying woman repeats the sign of the cross over and
          over, sobbing into a handkerchief.  Her husband's face is
          contorted in disgust.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    A week later I moved to London to
                    go to college and study drama.  My
                    mother said I broke her heart.

          Two young women cuddle on a park bench under a London summer
          sky, feeding the pigeons.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    But it was my integrity that was
                    important.  Is that so selfish?  It
                    sells for so little but it's all we
                    have left in this place...
          
          The black haired girl nibbles on the blonde's ear.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    It is the very last inch of us...
          
          INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM
          
          Evey struggles against Rossiter's weight who keeps her head
          submerged.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    But within that inch we are free.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    Enough.
          
          Rossiter wrenches back and Evey sucks hard for air, coughing
          out water.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    Now Miss Hammond, let us review the
                    facts.
          
          Evey stares at him, eyes red, heart pounding in her ears.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    You work for codename V.  Codename
                    V killed Delia Surridge and then
                    Derek Almond with your help and
                    that is why you were found outside
                    her home.
          
          Evey begins to shake her head, water sluicing off her thin
          face.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    Isn't that what happened, Miss
                    Hammond?
          
                              EVEY
                    No.  No, that isn't true --
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    Oh dear, Rossiter?
          
          Rossiter grabs Evey's neck --
          
                              EVEY
                    No, wait!
          
          Plunging her head into the bowl.  Water fills Evey's nose and
          ears.

                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    I played Dandini in Cinderella.
          
          The woman glances into the dark sea of faces.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    The world was strange and rustling
                    with invisible crowds behind the

          Two women weep in each other's arms, embracing in a perfect

                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    Work improved.  I got small film
                    roles, then bigger ones.
          
          The blonde woman brushes away a tear from the other's cheek.

                    In 2006, I starred in "The Salt

                    We fell in love.
          
          We pull back and see we are on location for a movie and the

          Ruth and Valerie sit on the couch watching television.  On

                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    Every Valentine's Day she sent me
                    roses and, oh god, we had so much. 
                    Those were the best three years of
                    my life.
          
          The two women stare at the newscast in tears, the sound of
          marching coming from the set's speakers.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    In 2010, they came.

          The sound of marching explodes as columns of men in brown
          uniforms and jack boots fill the streets.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    And after that there were no more

                    Not for anybody.
          
          Rossiter lets Evey up.  Her red burnt lungs gulp at the air.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    After the takeover, they started
                    rounding up the gays.  They took
                    Ruth while she was out looking for
                    food.
          
          Evey blinks hard, black fireworks exploding in her eyes.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    Why are they so frightened of us?
          
          She wheezes, on the edge of unconsciousness.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    They burned her face with
                    cigarettes and made her give them
                    my name.  She signed a statement
                    saying I'd seduced her.
          
          The interrogator's voice melts into a slag heap of sound with
          the hot, rhythmic pounding in her ears.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    I didn't blame her.  God, I loved
                    her but I didn't blame her.
          
          Rossiter uncuffs Evey, slipping the black bag over her head.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    But she did.
          
          Evey's knees buckle as he forces her to stand.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    She killed herself in her cell. 
                    She couldn't live with betraying
                    me, with giving up that last inch. 
                    Oh, Ruth.
          
          Evey weaves down the hall.  Rossiter shoving her from behind.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    They came for me.  They shaved off
                    my hair.  They held my head down a
                    toilet and told lesbian jokes. 
                    They brought me here and pumped me
                    full of chemicals.
          
          The cell door swings open.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    I can't feel my tongue.  I can't
                    speak.
          
          Rossiter yanks the hood from her head and pushes her in.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    It is strange that my life should
                    end in such a terrible place but
                    for three years I had roses and
                    apologized to nobody.
          
          The iron door slams shut, lock ringing in the stale air.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    I shall die here.  Every inch of me
                    shall perish...
          
          Evey rolls to her knees.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    Except one.
          
          She crawls for the rat hole.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    An inch.  It is small and fragile
                    and it's the only thing in the
                    world that's worth having.
          
          Her shaking hand pulls the letter from the stone crevice.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    We must never lose it or sell it or
                    give it away.  We must never let
                    them take it from us.
          
          Evey clutches it like a rosary as she begins to cry.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    I don't know who you are but I hope
                    you escape this place.  I hope that
                    the world turns and things get
                    better and that one day people have
                    roses again.
          
          She holds the note to her face, her tears soaking into the
          fragile paper.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    I don't know who you are but I love
                    you.  I love you.  Valerie.
          
          Slowly, Evey slips away, succumbing to blackness.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I had come to know every inch of
                    those four walls in that dark hell
                    and they knew every inch of me. 
                    Every inch...
          
          INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM
          
          Loud lights blare against Evey's solemn face.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Except one.
          
          A typed document sits on a small tray table in front of her.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    "My name is Evey Hammond.  On the
                    5th of November 2019, I was
                    abducted by the terrorist known as
                    codename V and then taken against
                    my will to an unknown location."
          
          Rossiter hovers just behind her as the Interrogator reads her
          confession.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    "Once there, I was systematically
                    brainwashed by means physical and
                    psychological.  I was frequently
                    subjected to sexual abuse during
                    this period."
          
          Evey's expression is unchanging.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    "Eventually I was terrorized into
                    helping him commit the murders of
                    Derek Almond, Dr. Delia Surridge,
                    and Anthony Lilliman, Bishop of
                    Westminster."
          
          Rossiter drops a pen on the table.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    "I, the undersigned, swear that the
                    above statement is genuine and that
                    it was not signed by means of
                    intimidation."
          
          The pen slowly rocks to a stop.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    We'd like you to sign that for us,
                    Miss Hammond.  Where we've put the
                    little cross.
          
          She blinks.
          
                              EVEY
                    No.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    As you wish.
          
          Rossiter begins unbuckling Evey's restraints.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    Escort Miss Hammond back to her
                    cell, Rossiter, where she will wait
                    while you arrange a wet detail of
                    six men.
          
          He forces Evey to her feet.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    Then take her out behind the
                    chemical sheds and shoot her.
          
          INT.  CELL
          
          The door opens behind Evey as she rereads Valerie's letter
          for the last time.
          
                              ROSSITER
                    It's time, unless you want to
                    change your mind.
          
          She holds the tattered piece of toilet paper to her chest.
          
                              ROSSITER
                    Sign that statement.  You could be
                    out inside three years.  Perhaps
                    they'd find you a job with the
                    Finger.
          
          Evey closes her eyes.
          
                              EVEY
                    Thank you but I'd rather die behind
                    the chemical sheds.
          
          Her last words hang in the air.
          
                              ROSSITER
                    Then there's nothing left to
                    threaten you with, is there?  You
                    are free.
          
          He turns and leaves.
          
                              EVEY
                    What?
          
          She listens as his footsteps fade down the hall, the door
          hanging weirdly open.
          
          Evey takes a few tentative steps toward the door and sticks
          her head out into the empty hall, peering down both ways.
          
          Slowly, she emerges from her cell, retracing her path down
          the hall that her blindfold never allowed her to see.
          
          Quietly inching along the wall, Evey peeks around a corner,
          gasping at the rigid guard standing off to the side.  There
          is something about the man's frozen stare that keeps her from
          running.
          
          Evey straightens and crosses to the guard.
          
          It is a mannequin.
          
          She touches him, the wheeled platform he is mounted on
          rolling back against the wall.
          
          INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM
          
          The door creaks open as Evey enters the room where for so
          long she was questioned and tortured.
          
          She crosses to the frozen Interrogator sitting at his desk.
          
          Her finger brushes lightly against the plastic hand, then
          Evey raps a knuckle on his hollow wooden head.  Around his
          neck a small speaker hangs from a cord.
          
          Evey drifts uneasily into a back room where a discarded
          prison guard's uniform hangs on a rack.  On a table next to a
          wig and pair of gloves, the rat looks up at her through the
          bars of its tiny cage.
          
          She moves through another door, the wind suddenly knocked
          from her chest as she finally sees where her prison was
          built --
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          V steps from the shadows.
          
                              V
                    Welcome home, Evey.
          
                              EVEY
                    You...
          
          Her mouth hangs open.
          
                              EVEY
                    You did this... to me.
          
          Evey's rail thin figure begins to shake.
          
                              EVEY
                    You did this to me!
          
          She stumbles against the wall, unable to support herself.
          
                              EVEY
                    You -- You hit me and -- and cut my
                    hair.  It was you.  It was just you
                    all this time.
          
          She doubles over, covering her face as she bursts into tears.
          
                              EVEY
                    You tortured me.  You tortured me --
          
          Evey looks up at him, body shivering as he quietly glides
          toward her.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh god, why?
          
                              V
                    Because I love you, Evey.  Because
                    I wanted to set you free.
          
                              EVEY
                    Love?
          
          A look of horror twists her starved face.
          
                              EVEY
                    Set me free?  Don't you realize?
          
          Slender fingers ball into fists.
          
                              EVEY
                    Don't you realize what you did to
                    me?  You nearly drove me mad!
          
          Disgust and anger light up her eyes.
          
                              EVEY
                    I hate you.
          
          Her little, wiry body coils tight as she circles him.
          
                              EVEY
                    I hate you!  Set me free?  You put
                    me in a prison to set me free?!
          
                              V
                    You were already in a prison. 
                    You've been in a prison all your
                    life.
          
                              EVEY
                    Shut up!  I don't want to hear it. 
                    I wasn't in a prison.  I was happy! 
                    I was happy here --
          
                              V
                    Happiness is the most insidious
                    prison of all, Evey.
          
                              EVEY
                    That's warped!  That's evil and
                    it's wrong!  What gives you the
                    right to judge?  Who are you to say
                    what's not good enough?!
          
                              V
                    You were born in a prison, Evey.  I
                    didn't put you there.  I just
                    showed you the bars.  You've been
                    in a prison so long, you no longer
                    believe there's an outside world.
          
          She wheels away from him, covering her ears, trying to get
          away from his voice.
          
                              EVEY
                    Shut up!  You're mad!  I don't want
                    to hear it!
          
                              V
                    That's because you're afraid, Evey. 
                    You're afraid because you can feel
                    freedom closing in on you.  You're
                    afraid because freedom is
                    terrifying.
          
          Evey falls, stumbling through the labyrinth of the Shadow
          Gallery.
          
                              EVEY
                    I can't feel anything!  There's
                    nothing left to feel!  Don't you
                    understand?
          
                              V
                    Don't back away from it, Evey. 
                    Part of you understands the truth
                    even as part pretends not to.
          
          She collapses, head pounding.
          
                              V
                    Woman, this is the most important
                    moment in your life.  Don't run
                    from it.
          
                              EVEY
                    I don't know what -- Oh god -- I
                    can't breathe --
          
          V couches next to her.
          
                              V
                    Good.  You're almost there.  Go
                    closer.  Feel the shape of it.
          
                              EVEY
                    What are you doing to me?  I can't
                    breathe --
          
                              V
                    You were in a cell.  They offered
                    you a choice between the death of
                    your principles and the death of
                    your body.
          
          He cradles her as she hyperventilates, tears streaming down
          her face.
          
                              EVEY
                    I feel -- I feel like I'm going to
                    burst.
          
                              V
                    You said you'd rather die.  You
                    faced the fear of your own death
                    and you were calm.  Try to feel now
                    what you felt then.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh god -- I felt --
          
          The mask hovers over her.
          
                              EVEY
                    Like an angel --
          
          He squeezes her shuddering body.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh god, V, I'm so scared.  What's
                    happening to me?
          
                              V
                    The door of the cage is open, Evey. 
                    All that you feel is the wind from
                    outside.  Don't be afraid.
          
          Gently, he lifts her.
          
                              V
                    Try to walk.  The lift will take us
                    to the roof.
          
                              EVEY
                    The roof?  Outside?
          
          He helps her to an open elevator.
          
                              EVEY
                    I -- I don't want to be
                    blindfolded.
          
                              V
                    No, Evey.  No more blindfolds.
          
          The cage in the elevator rattles shut.
          
          EXT.  ROOF - NIGHT
          
          The two figures stand in the door of the roof access, a
          raging tempest oozing from a split sky.
          
          Something draws Evey out into the storm.
          
          Slowly, she walks beneath it, the wind and rain pounding
          against her thin frame.  Evey lets the coarse slipover fall
          to the ground and stares straight up into the storm, naked,
          the elements soaking into her very being.
          
          V moves up behind her.
          
                              V
                    Do you feel it?
          
                              EVEY
                    Everything's so -- different.
          
                              V
                    I know.  Five years ago, I too
                    stared beneath a night like this. 
                    Naked under a roaring sky.
          
          A low rumble of thunder washes over London.
          
                              V
                    The night is yours, Evey.  Seize
                    it.  Encircle it within your arms.
          
          His words buffet against her with the sheets of rain.
          
                              V
                    Bury it in your heart up to the
                    hilt.
          
          She raises her arms to embrace the raging torrent.
          
                              V
                    Become transfixed and
                    transfigured -- 
                    
          A jagged bolt of lightning shatters the sky.
          
                              V
                    Forever.
          
          EXT.  NEW GOVERNMENT BUILDING
          
          Finch gets out of a police car and looks up the black face of
          the modern building.  He sighs and taps his pipe against the
          heel of his shoe.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    Finch!
          
          Finch turns to find Dascombe hurrying towards him.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    Do you know what this is all about?
          
                              FINCH
                    No, but I can guess.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    What?
          
                              FINCH
                    "Remember, remember, the fifth of
                    November."
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    Oh come on.  He's long gone.  He
                    has to be.  He did what he came to
                    do and it's over.
          
          Finch chews on his pipe.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    Isn't it?
          
                              FINCH
                    Not for us.
          
          He turns and heads into the building.
          
                                                          FADE OUT.
          
          FADE IN:
          
          EXT.  NEW GOVERNMENT BUILDING - DAY
          
          A dark November sky hangs like a shroud over the building.
          
                              LEADER (V.O.)
                    A year, gentlemen.
          
          INT.  COUNCIL CONFERENCE ROOM
          
          The heads of each department are gathered around a table of
          black granite.
          
          Peter Creedy, sitting back out of the lights, is the new head
          of the Finger.
          
                              LEADER
                    I have given you almost a year and
                    you have given me nothing. 
                    Nothing!
          
          He glares at Finch.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    Now Adam, there is no one better
                    than Finch and you know it.
          
                              LEADER
                    Yes, Mr. Dascombe, I do know it. 
                    It is that very fact that keeps me
                    awake at night, wondering if
                    perhaps there is a reason that Mr.
                    Finch has failed.
          
                              FINCH
                    What are you saying?
          
                              LEADER
                    I'm saying that perhaps I don't
                    know you as well as I thought I
                    did.
          
                              FINCH
                    Are you asking for my resignation?
          
                              LEADER
                    No, I am asking for some goddamn
                    results!
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    It's not Finch's fault, Adam.
          
                              CONRAD
                    We've all been looking.  The man
                    simply disappeared.
          
                              ETHERIDGE
                    Vanished.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    He's gone, Adam.  It's over.
          
          The Leader trembles like a volcano set to blow.
          
                              LEADER
                    It's over, is it?  He's gone. 
                    Vanished, you say?
          
          The Leader grabs a large box from the floor and hurls reams
          of computer printout across the table.
          
                              LEADER
                    Transcripts recorded over the last
                    thirty days in which the terrorist
                    was talked about or mentioned in a
                    positive context.  This is only
                    thirty days!
          
          He punches a "play" button and a wall of monitors blink on. 
          It is a recording of a television variety show.
          
          A character that is made to look like Adam Susan is giving a
          speech.  A woman is dressed like V except that the only thing
          she is wearing under her cloak is a garter belt, stockings
          and high heels.
          
          V sneaks up behind Susan and yanks his pants down.  Susan is
          outraged but when he gives chase he trips over his pants. 
          The audience hoots and howls.
          
          The Leader kills the tape.
          
                              LEADER
                    Is this what you consider,
                    "disappeared?"
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    For god's sake, Adam, it's a stupid
                    variety show.
          
                              LEADER
                    Mr. Creedy, I want the producers,
                    writers, and actors of that "stupid
                    variety show" arrested and charged
                    with sedition.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Yes, sir.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    You can't be serious --
          
                              LEADER
                    Push me, Roger, push me and you'll
                    find out how serious I am.
          
          He stares each of them to silence.
          
                              LEADER
                    This, this V is still out there.  I
                    can feel him like a sickness
                    worming its way into the hearts and
                    minds of the public.  Something
                    must be done, and done quickly, to
                    exorcise this demon for the very
                    soul of this country is at stake.
          
          He pauses.
          
                              LEADER
                    That is why I am compelled to give
                    each and every one of you notice
                    that if by the fifth of November
                    you are still giving me nothing
                    more than excuses, I will have to
                    revoke your party status and
                    terminate your positions.
          
          Everyone is stunned.
          
                              LEADER
                    Mr. Creedy, I will speak with you
                    in private.  The rest of you are
                    dismissed.  England prevails.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S PRIVATE QUARTERS
          
          The Leader stands at the window.
          
                              LEADER
                    Mr. Creedy, as the new head of the
                    Finger, you are the most important
                    member of my cabinet.
          
                              CREEDY
                    I, uh, appreciate your faith in me.
          
                              LEADER
                    Your predecessor, Mr. Almond, was a
                    good man, a man who understood what
                    strength in unity meant, a man who,
                    above all, loved his country.  I
                    need to know if you are such a man.
          
          His eyes bore into him.
          
                              LEADER
                    Do you love your country, Mr.
                    Creedy?
          
          EXT.  ALLEYWAY
          
          A police car is parked in a dark alley.  It is raining and
          the windows of the car are completely steamed.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Oh god, yes!
          
          He is sweating, his knuckles white as he squeezes the
          steering wheel, panting.
          
          We hear a noise like a very wet kiss and then a woman's
          voice.
          
                              HELEN
                    "The most important member of my
                    cabinet."  Yes it is, isn't it,
                    dear?
          
          Helen lifts her head out of his lap.  Her lipstick is smeared
          about her mouth.

                    Oh, don't stop.
          
                              HELEN
                    I stop when you stop.  What did he
                    say next?
          
                              CREEDY
                    I can't --
          
          She whispers in his ear while playing with his lap.
          
                              HELEN
                    Come on, Peter, what are you afraid
                    of?  Almond used to tell me
                    everything and you're twice the man
                    he was.
          
                              CREEDY
                    He asked me... if I loved my
                    country.
          
                              HELEN
                    Oh yes, I can tell you do love your
                    country, almost as much as you love
                    this...
          
          She lowers her head into this lap.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Oh god...
          
                              HELEN
                    Go on.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Then he asked me to do something...
                    oh, oh...
          
                              HELEN
                    What?
          
                              CREEDY
                    Helen, I can't.  I can't tell you.
          
          Helen lifts her head.
          
                              HELEN
                    He told you to frame someone as the
                    terrorist.
          
                              CREEDY
                    My god?!  How did you know that?
          
                              HELEN
                    I know Adam Susan.  Now who was it?
          
                              CREEDY
                    No way.  I can't tell you that.
          
                              HELEN
                    Yes you can, honey.  You can and
                    you will.  You have to trust me,
                    love.  We're going to help each
                    other.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Helen, please.
          
                              HELEN
                    Look at that face.  You see? 
                    You're just bursting to tell me.
          
          Her head drops back down.  Creedy moans.
          
                              HELEN
                    Now who was it?
          
                              CREEDY
                    It was... Fi... Fi... FINCH!
          
          The name seems to orgasm from his mouth.
          
          INT.  FINCH'S APARTMENT
          
          Finch sits alone in his modest apartment, reading a book. 
          The book is Koesterler's, "The Roots of Coincidence."
          
          An old CD player is playing music, a Bach piano concerto.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          V is playing the exact same concerto on his piano, his gloved
          fingers gracefully flitting across the keys.
          
          Evey enters the gallery.  Her hair has grown out but is still
          short.  She projects a kind of strength that comes from a
          deep inner peace.
          
          V coaxes the final delicate notes and lets them softly fade.
          
                              EVEY
                    That was beautiful.
          
          She walks up to him and takes the smiling face in her hands.
          
                              EVEY
                    I've wanted to do this for a long
                    time.
          
          She bends and gently kisses the frozen lips.
          
                              EVEY
                    Thank you, V.  Thank you for
                    everything you've done for me.
          
                              V
                    You did it all yourself, Evey.  I
                    just provided the backdrop but the
                    drama was all your own.
          
                              EVEY
                    It was a good backdrop.  I believed
                    it.  I really did.  It's still a
                    bit hard for me to accept that it
                    wasn't real.  That it was just you. 
                    Especially the letter.
          
          She takes the letter from her pocket.
          
                              EVEY
                    It is a beautiful letter, V.  Every
                    time I read it I could feel
                    Valerie, almost like she was
                    holding me.  I believed in her most
                    of all.  I believed that she loved
                    me and I loved her back.
          
          She looks down.
          
                              EVEY
                    I feel a bit foolish telling you
                    this.  I know that you must have
                    written it and thought you should
                    have it back.
          
                              V
                    But I didn't write that letter,
                    Evey.
          
                              EVEY
                    What?
          
                              V
                    Come with me.
          
          INT.  VALERIE'S ROOM
          
          It is a shrine.  The walls are covered with movie posters and
          reviews and pictures of an actresses named Valerie Page.  We
          recognize her as the woman chosen for the medical block just
          before V.
          
          Everywhere there are flower boxes filled with blooming roses;
          violet carsons.
          
                              EVEY
                    Valerie?
          
                              V
                    Yes.  Valerie Page.  She was the
                    woman in room four.
          
                              EVEY
                    She's beautiful.
          
                              V
                    She wrote the letter just before
                    she died.  I delivered it to you as
                    it was delivered to me.  The words
                    you wept over were the same words
                    that transformed me.
          
          Evey smiles and bends to smell the roses.
          
                              EVEY
                    Roses.  You grew them for her.
          
                              V
                    Yes.
          
                              EVEY
                    They're beautiful.
          
                              V
                    Evey, do you know what day it is?
          
                              EVEY
                    Two days before the first day we
                    met.
          
                              V
                    You remembered.
          
                              EVEY
                    You're planning something, aren't
                    you, V?
          
                              V
                    You know me too well now.
          
                              EVEY
                    What are you going to do?
          
                              V
                    I'm going to fulfill an old
                    promise.
          
          Evey cocks an eyebrow.
          
                              V
                    I'll show you.
          
          INT.  UNDERGROUND STAIRWELL
          
          Carrying a lantern, V leads Evey down a dark stone staircase.
          
                              EVEY
                    I've never been here before.
          
                              V
                    Yes.  It is the deepest part of my
                    home.  Once you know it, I should
                    think you'll know everything.
          
          He pushes a button and a secret passage opens in a heavy
          stone wall.
          
          There is a small narrow series of passageways that he guides
          her through, leading to another door.  Evey steps out into an
          underground subway station.
          
          INT.  VICTORIA STATION
          
          Parked beside the concrete platform is a beautiful antique
          train car.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh, V, it's lovely.  Where on earth
                    did you find it?
          
                              V
                    In a way, I suppose it really found
                    me.
          
          Evey steps into the train car and finds it filled with little
          packages wrapped in wax paper.
          
                              EVEY
                    What's in these packages?
          
                              V
                    Gelignite.
          
          She screams and almost drops one.
          
                              V
                    Careful.
          
                              EVEY
                    What are you going to do with all
                    of it?
          
                              V
                    I told you.  I'm going to finish
                    what was started four hundred years
                    ago.
          
                              EVEY
                    Where does this train go?
          
                              V
                    This is the old Victoria line but
                    it is blocked, blocked somewhere
                    between Whitehall and St. James.
          
                              EVEY
                    Whitehall... V, that's the New
                    Government Building.
          
          V nods.
          
                              EVEY
                    But the underground has been shut
                    down for years.  How are you going
                    to make it run without any power?
          
                              V
                    I just thought I might ask them to
                    turn it on for me.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE
          
          The Leader sits bathed in the flickering images of the Fate
          computer.
          
                              LEADER
                    Yes, Mr. Creedy?
          
                              CREEDY
                    Everything's set, sir.  No worries.
          
                              LEADER
                    When?
          
                              CREEDY
                    Tonight.
          
          On one of the screens, a television program has just begun.
          
                              ANNOUNCER
                    Tonight on Tales from the Bible, a
                    story of treachery and betrayal
                    from the Book of Daniel.
          
          We cut from that screen to another screen --
          
          INT.  JORDAN TOWER - CONTROL BOOTH
          
          The television studio where Roger Dascombe surveys a large
          bank of monitors filled with the images of typically vapid
          television entertainment.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    All of London's waiting.  Ready,
                    two.  And here we go --
          
          A player locks on as a recorded program begins.  We move in
          as the logo slashes across the screen: Storm Saxon.
          
                              ANNOUNCER
                    Tonight, England's greatest hero
                    repels the forces of darkness in a
                    brand new episode.
          
          We pull back from the show's opening teaser and find
          ourselves looking at a small television.
          
          INT.  JORDAN TOWER
          
          In the delivery bay at the back of Jordan tower, five
          security guards are riveted to the heroic actions of Storm
          Saxon.
          
                              HEIDI
                    Oh, Storm.  Save me!  Save me!
          
                              STORM
                    You mongrel trash, if you harm her!
          
                              MONGREL TRASH
                    Look out, de white debil has a
                    laser lugar!
          
          Behind them, a shadowy figure in a cloak and tall hat enters
          the loading bay.
          
                              GUARD
                    Hey, what the -- ?
          
          They all turn and find a smiling V.
          
          They go for their weapons.  V goes for them.  It is brutal
          and quick, knives slicing in bloody arcs, bodies kicked and
          thrown with superhuman power.
          
          The TV crashes to the ground and we move in at it as Storm
          Saxon stands triumphant beside his buxom lass.
          
                              HEIDI
                    Oh Storm, hold me.  Hold me tight.
          
          We pull back on another television screen inside --
          
          INT.  FINCH'S OFFICE
          
          Dominic is chewing on a hamburger, engrossed in Storm Saxon. 
          Across the room, Finch is reading the "Roots of Coincidence."
          
                              FINCH
                    I don't know how you stand that
                    tripe.
          
          Dominic answers with a mouthful of cheeseburger.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Es gooh.
          
          Finch shakes his head, reaching for his pipe.  He realizes he
          is out of tobacco.  He slides open the bottom desk drawer and
          his eyes almost pop out of his head.
          
          He stares into the drawer like someone staring at his own
          tombstone.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Finch?  Finch, what's wrong?
          
          Slowly, he lifts something from the drawer.  On his desk, he
          lays out several knives, a cloak, a hat, and a smiling mask.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    What the hell?
          
          Finch lifts the mask and almost has to laugh.
          
                              FINCH
                    Don't you see, Dominic?
          
          He puts the mask to his face.
          
                              FINCH
                    I'm V.
          
          INT.  JORDAN TOWER
          
          V emerges from an elevator and immediately attacks several
          more guards.  A surveillance camera watches as V steps over
          their slumped, broken bodies.
          
          INT.  CONTROL CENTER
          
          The security guard sees V on the monitor coming directly down
          the hall.
          
                              GUARD
                    Bloody hell!
          
          He grabs the machine gun, aiming it just as V kicks open the
          door.
          
                              GUARD
                    Freeze!
          
          V stops.  At least five guards have trained their weapons on
          him.  He is surrounded.
          
          Slowly, he lifts his arms as though surrendering.  His cloak
          opens, revealing enough TNT to level the entire building.  In
          his hand is the plunger detonator.
          
                              GUARD
                    Fuck all.
          
          V nods.
          
          INT.  FINCH'S OFFICE
          
          The door bursts open as Creedy and a group of heavily armed
          Fingermen muscle in.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Creedy?  What the hell's going on?
          
                              CREEDY
                    I'm here to arrest Mr. Finch for
                    acts of treason and terrorism.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    You can't be serious.
          
                              CREEDY
                    If I were you, boy, I'd shut my
                    hole unless you want to start
                    explaining why you didn't say
                    nothing about Mr. Finch's secret
                    identity.
          
          INT.  JORDAN TOWER
          
          V follows Roger Dascombe into the main control booth.  The
          door shuts behind them and they are alone.
          
          All around them are the laugh tracks and gunshots of the
          evening's entertainment.
          
          V puts his hand into his cloak and pulls out a videotape.  He
          hands it to Dascombe.
          
          INT.  FINCH'S OFFICE
          
          Finch glares at Creedy.
          
                              FINCH
                    Why don't you just shoot me,
                    Creedy?  Wouldn't that make
                    everything a lot simpler?
          
                              CREEDY
                    Yeah, I suppose it would.
          
          Creedy smiles, his finger tightening on the trigger when --
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Holy Christ!  Creedy, you stupid
                    ape!  If Finch is V then tell me
                    who is that?
          
          He points at the television where V sits calmly at a desk in
          front of the "VTV" logo.
          
                              V
                    Good evening, London.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Bloody fuckin' hell.
          
                              V
                    I thought it was time we had a
                    little talk.
          
                              FINCH
                    He has to be at Jordan tower.  Come
                    on!
          
          Finch and Dominic rush out of the room.  Creedy looks at his
          confused men.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Don't just stand there!  Follow
                    them!
          
          INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE
          
          V smiles at the horrified Adam Susan.
          
                              V
                    Are you sitting comfortably?  Good. 
                    Then I'll begin.
          
          The Leader screams, pounding on Fate.
          
                              LEADER
                    Damn you!  Damn you!
          
          He hits the intercom.
          
                              LEADER
                    Lieutenant, ready my transport.  I
                    want every armed man within a
                    hundred miles at Jordan tower. 
                    Now!
          
          We move in at VTV.
          
                              V
                    Right now, I imagine there are
                    hundreds of soldiers rushing here
                    to kill me because someone does not
                    want us to talk.
          
          We pull back in --
          
          INT.  LIVING ROOM
          
          A family watching television.  In the background, two
          children are squabbling.
          
                              MOTHER
                    Hush.  Turn it up.
          
          The husband does.  V's voice gets louder as we move towards
          him.
          
                              V
                    They are afraid that I am going to
                    say the things that are not
                    supposed to be said.  They are
                    afraid that I am going to say the
                    truth.
          
          INT.  APARTMENT
          
          A man sits on his couch, mesmerized by V.
          
                              V
                    The truth is that there is
                    something terribly wrong with this
                    country, isn't there?  If you look
                    about, you witness cruelty,
                    injustice and despotism.  But what
                    do you do about it?  What can you
                    do?
          
          He pops his beer tab and the beer foams over the couch but he
          doesn't seem to notice.
          
          INT.  FINCH'S POLICE CAR
          
          The car races wildly towards Jordan tower as Finch and
          Dominic listen to the broadcast on the radio.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    You are but a single individual. 
                    How can you possible make any
                    difference?  Individuals have no
                    power in this modern world. 
                    That is what you've been taught
                    because that is what they need you
                    to believe.  But it is not true.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S TRANSPORT
          
          The Leader seethes, staring at three television monitors in
          his limo which are all filled with V.
          
                              V
                    This is why they are afraid and the
                    reason that I am here; to remind
                    you that it is individuals who
                    always hold the power.  The real
                    power.  Individuals like me.  And
                    individuals like you.
          
          INT.  KITTY KAT KELLER
          
          The bar is almost completely soundless except for the voice
          of V.  People stare at the television as if the moment were
          somehow suspended in time.
          
                              V
                    I have come to offer you a deal. 
                    If you accept, I will give you a
                    different world.  A world without
                    curfews, without soldiers and
                    surveillance systems.  A world that
                    is not run by other men but that is
                    run by you.  I am offering you a
                    second chance.

                    Four hundred years ago, a great
                    citizen made a most significant
                    contribution to our common culture. 
                    It was a contribution forged in
                    secrecy and stealth although it is
                    best remembered in noise and bright
                    light.
          
          EXT.  TELEVISION STORE
          
          A crowd has gathered, watching through the window.

                    To commemorate that glorious night
                    at precisely the stroke of
                    midnight, the edifice of their
                    world will erupt with enough sound
                    and fury to shake the earth.  All I
                    ask is that you join me at the
                    gates to watch as the past is
                    erased, the pathway cleared so that
                    together we can start toward a new
                    day.
          
          EXT.  JORDAN TOWER
          
          The Leader climbs out of his limo and is met by one of his
          captains.

                    I want this man dead!  I want him
                    shot on sight!
          
                              CAPTAIN
                    Yes, sir.

                              V (V.O.)
                    But, you ask, who am I to make such
                    promises?  A fair question but
                    hardly necessary as you know me
                    already.  To know me any more you
                    need only look to a mirror.
          
          Finch catches a glimpse of himself in the mirror.

                    Truth be told, this wasn't even my
                    idea, was it?  If you think back,
                    you'll remember that night,
                    whispering in your lover's arms.  I
                    became a part of your plan just as
                    you have now become part of mine. 
                    Give me the line of the queen and
                    I'll give you your secret dream.

          A heavy battering ram is rushed down the hall, carried by
          four soldiers.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    On the twelfth stroke of the fifth
                    day of the eleventh month, I hope
                    we shall all meet again.

                    Until then, I bid you goodnight.
          
          Every screen suddenly goes black.  The crowd turns to each
          other, unsure of what to do.

          The door explodes open.  V is standing alone, almost as if
          waiting for them.
          
          Before he can even move, they shoot.  Machine gun fire lights
          up the room.  V's body dances and jerks backward, smashing
          through an observation window --
          
          Falling to the television stage below.
          
          INT.  HALL
          
          A path is cleared for the Leader.  As he heads into the
          television studio, an armed soldier is heading in the
          opposite direction.
          
          It is impossible to tell because of the dark face plate but
          it looks like the soldier is smiling.
          
          The Leader shoves his way onto the main stage.  A group of
          soldiers is gathered around the body.
          
                              LEADER
                    Who was it?  Who was he?
          
          The mask is pried off, revealing the lifeless face of Roger
          Dascombe.  To the Leader, it is an obvious revelation.
          
                              LEADER
                    Roger Dascombe!  Of course.  Of
                    course!  It makes such perfect
                    sense.
          
                              CAPTAIN
                    Sir, I think there has been a
                    mistake.
          
                              LEADER
                    No!  There is no mistake!
          
                              CAPTAIN
                    But sir, there are people that say
                    they saw both the terrorist and
                    Dascombe together --
          
                              LEADER
                    Who?  Who are these people?  They
                    must be detained immediately. 
                    Whatever they saw or whatever they
                    think they saw is subordinate to
                    the truth and that truth is that
                    Roger Dascombe is the terrorist and
                    the terrorist is dead!
          
                              FINCH
                    But I thought I was the terrorist.
          
          Finch's voice stops the Leader cold.
          
                              LEADER
                    Finch, what are you doing here?
          
                              FINCH
                    Since I'm not in jail and since you
                    have another, even more convenient
                    suspect.  I'm guessing the charges
                    have been dropped.
          
                              LEADER
                    Be careful, Finch.
          
                              FINCH
                    I am careful, sir.  Always.  That
                    is why I suggest that a search of
                    this building begin immediately.
          
                              LEADER
                    The terrorist is dead!
          
                              FINCH
                    With all due respect, I disagree
                    and I believe that he is presently
                    trying to get out of this building
                    disguised as one of us.
          
                              LEADER
                    Are you challenging my authority?
          
                              FINCH
                    No sir, I'm trying to run an
                    investigation --
          
                              LEADER
                    I am trying to run a country!  When
                    I tell you, Mr. Finch, the
                    terrorist is dead, then the
                    terrorist is dead!  If you continue
                    to suggest otherwise then you will
                    leave me no choice but to have you
                    arrested on charges of sedition. 
                    Do I make myself clear?
          
          He eyes the room.  Everyone is silent.

                    Now, it is imperative for the
                    people of London to know that they
                    are safe, that the terrorist is
                    dead and everything is under
                    control.
          
          The Leader storms past Finch who looks at Dascombe and bites
          down on his pipe.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          One of the Ear's black vans has been modified with large
          speakers wired to the roof.  As the van rolls down the
          street, the speakers drone with a looped message.
          
                              SPEAKERS
                    The terrorist is dead.  No further
                    threat exists.  Everything is under
                    control.
          
          Out of the back, soldiers hurl leaflets that swirl and
          flutter in the van's wake.
          
          The little girl on the bicycle that we saw earlier stops and
          picks up one of the leaflets.
          
          It has a picture with the body of Roger Dascombe beneath the
          headline, "The terrorist is dead!  London is safe once
          again!"
          
                              LITTLE GIRL
                    Bollocks.
          
          She crumbles the leaflet and throws it.
          
                              LITTLE GIRL
                    Bollocks!
          
          She gets off her bike and takes something out of the
          backpack.
          
                              LITTLE GIRL
                    He's not dead!  It's all bollocks!
          
          Turning to a nearby wall, she spray paints a large circle
          around a "V".
          
          INT.  FINCH'S OFFICE
          
          A recording of VTV plays on the small television.

                    queen, I'll give you your secret
                    dream.
          
          Dominic freezes the image; V stares at them, smiling.
          
                              FINCH

                    Come on, Finch.  We've seen it
                    fifty times.  I mean, after what
                    they done to you, I don't know why
                    we're even trying to stop him.
          
          Finch stares out the window.
          
                              FINCH
                    I don't know.  For twenty seven
                    years, I've been at this job. 
                    Twenty seven years, I've done what
                    I've been told to do.  Maybe that's
                    all there is to it.  I'm just a
                    dumb old dog.  A dumb old dog that
                    only knows one trick.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    That ain't it, Finch.  It's more
                    than that.  I know you.  It's
                    something personal with this one.
          
          Finch smiles.
          
                              FINCH
                    Maybe.  And maybe I'm not ready for
                    a revolution.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Well, we got less than thirty hours
                    to stop it.
          
                              FINCH
                    We will.

                    How?
          
                              FINCH
                    It's on the tape.  I know it.  I
                    can feel it.  He did this for a
                    reason.  He needs something.

                    What?
          
                              FINCH
                    The line of the Queen?
          
                              DOMINIC
                    But what does that mean?
          
                              FINCH
                    Maybe it's a line from Shakespeare. 
                    Or a book.  I don't know.
          
          He rewinds and starts the tape.

          Helen Heyer is lying on her bed, eating chocolates, watching
          V through calculating eyes.
          
          At her feet, we hear a suckling noise that suddenly stops.

                    Helen?  Helen, why did you want
                    that tape?
          
                              HELEN
                    Shut up, Conrad.  I'm thinking.
          
          She shoves her foot back into his mouth and he continues to
          suck on it and each of her toes.

                    How?  How did you know that?
          
          Conrad moves up her ankle, licking and kissing his way to her

          at him.

                    All right.  You have a deal.
          
          Conrad licks along the inside of her thigh until she slaps

                    Oh no!  Not you.  Conrad.  Not yet. 
                    Here you can have a chocolate. 
                    Open up.  Open!
          
          She shoves the candy in his mouth.

                    Right now I need something else

                    pretty little brain for me.  You
                    know all about the old underground,

          He nods still gagged with the candy.

                    Good evening London.  As Leader of

                    imperative to speak with you and to
                    assure you once and for all that
                    the shadow that recently fell
                    across our land has indeed passed.

                    What we have endured this long year
                    was no accident, no mere
                    coincidence.  This was not a simple
                    act of terror conducted by a
                    singular madman.  No, this was a

                    this year.  It was our beliefs. 
                    Our faith.  I believe that God
                    himself bore witness to our

                    How do I know this?  Let me read to
                    you where I found the answer, where
                    I so often find the answer.  In the
                    Scripture.  Revelations.
          
          EXT.  STREET CORNER - NIGHT
          
          The megaphones blast the Leader's voice.
          
                              LEADER (V.O.)
                    "If any man have an ear, let him
                    hear."
          
          INT.  FINCH'S OFFICE
          
          There are stacks of printout everywhere.
          
                              LEADER (V.O.)
                    "He that leadeth into captivity
                    shall go into captivity; he that
                    killeth with the sword shall be
                    killed with the sword.  Here is the
                    patience and faith of the Saints."
          
          Finch stops reading, listening to the radio.
          
                              LEADER (V.O.)
                    "And I beheld another beast coming
                    out of the Earth; and he had two
                    horns like a lamb and he spake as a
                    dragon."
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          Another radio crackles with the Leader's voice.
          
                              LEADER (V.O.)
                    "And he doeth great wonders, so
                    that he maketh fire come down from
                    Heaven on the Earth in the sight of
                    men."
          
          V nods, almost laughing as Evey enters the gallery.
          
                              LEADER (V.O.)
                    "And he deceiveth them that dwell
                    on the Earth by the means of those
                    miracles which he had the power to
                    do --"

                    Oh, V, turn it off, please.
          
                              V
                    Of course, my dear.
          
          He reaches over and changes the frequency.  We hear voices,
          hushed and secret but we recognize them.
          
                              CREEDY (V.O.)
                    But how does he know?
          
                              HELEN (V.O.)
                    I don't know.  All I know is he
                    does... And I know what he wants.
          
          The voices are labored, punctuated by gasps and moans.
          
                              EVEY
                    What is that, V?
          
                              V
                    That, Evey, is what I have been
                    waiting for.
          
                              CREEDY (V.O.)
                    Do you know what I want?  I want
                    you just like this... Bent over
                    that black leather chair...
          
          We are pulled by the radio into --
          
          INT.  CREEDY'S BEDROOM
          
          Where we see a tiny microphone hidden in the ceiling light
          above the bed.
          
          Helen moans as we drift down, glimpsing Helen, her arms
          reaching for the edges of the bed, her back arching up
          towards Creedy, behind her, smiling.
          
                              CREEDY
                    What about Conrad?
          
                              HELEN
                    I told you, I'll handle Conrad and
                    V will take care of Susan.  The mob
                    will take care of the guard and
                    then... You can use the Finger to
                    take over.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Use the Finger?  You mean like
                    this?
          
          He inserts a finger into her.
          
                              HELEN
                    Oh... oh... that is vulgar...
          
                              CREEDY
                    But you like it?
          
                              HELEN
                    Yes, oh yes, oh you're a pig,
                    Peter...
          
                              CREEDY
                    That I am, misses.  But I'm the pig
                    that's gonna be running this
                    country.
          
          That sends a shiver through Helen's body.
          
                              HELEN
                    Yes and I'm... I'm going to be
                    Eva... Oh Eva...
          
          Her eyes close and her fists knot the sheets.
          
                              HELEN
                    "Don't cry for me Argen... oh
                    Argen... Argen... tina!
          
          The word is almost lost in her orgasm.
          
          EXT.  LONDON
          
          The sun rises over London.  It is the morning of the fourth.
          
          INT.  FINCH'S OFFICE
          
          Finch looks through the blinds at the morning sun.  He has
          been up all night.  He checks his watch: 6:00am.
          
                              FINCH
                    Eighteen hours.
          
          Rubbing the knot in his neck, he turns back to his office
          which is now buried beneath mounds of paper.
          
          Dominic is passed out, sprawled on the couch, and clutching a
          printout from Spencer's "Fairy Queen."
          
                              FINCH
                    Dominic!
          
          Dominic jumps, immediately searching the printout.
          
                              FINCH
                    Dominic, go home.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    But I've still got over three
                    hundred lines from The Fairy Queen.
          
                              FINCH
                    Forget it.  There's no more time. 
                    You go home and get some rest. 
                    You're going to need it tonight.
          
          Dominic lets the papers fall to the floor.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    He's got us, doesn't he, Finch?
          
                              FINCH
                    Yes, he does.

          Conrad pulls his car into his reserved space.
          
          INT.  CAR
          
          Helen holds Conrad's chin the way a mother holds a child when
          she is telling them something important.
          
                              HELEN
                    Now listen to me, Conrad.  This is
                    the most important moment of our
                    lives.  Everything I've worked and
                    hoped for comes to this.  Susan is
                    a very dangerous man, especially
                    now, that's why I need you, Conrad. 
                    I need you to be stronger than him. 
                    I need you to be the better man. 
                    Understand?
          
          Conrad nods.
          
                              HELEN
                    If you do this Conrad, and you do
                    it right, I'm going to turn you
                    from the little man I married into
                    the man of my dreams.
          
                              CONRAD
                    Oh, Helen.
          
          He embraces her to kiss but she turns her perfectly painted
          lips.
          
                              HELEN
                    Not on the lips.
          
          Ardently, he kisses her cheek.
          
          INT.  FINCH'S OFFICE
          
          Finch sits alone, palms pressed to his bleary eyes.
          
                              FINCH
                    Give it up, old man.  You're not
                    even sure you want to stop him.
          
          With a red pen, he begins absently drawing red circles around
          any V he sees on any piece of paper.
          
          Victims.  Vectors.  Values.  Victory.  Words from quotes and
          lists.
          
          Suddenly, he stops.  Carefully, as if reaching to touch a
          butterfly, he slips a single sheet out from the sheaves
          covering his desk.
          
          The paper has a long list: the names of all the Queens of
          England.  He has circled in red the V in Victoria.
          
          When it hits him, it hits him like a falling safe.
          
                              FINCH
                    Christ!  That's it!  It's got to be
                    it!

          The intercom clicks on.

                    Sir, yes, sir -- Wait, you can't
                    go --
          
          The door slaps open.
          
                              HELEN
                    Leader, I'm terribly sorry but I
                    absolutely must speak with you.
          
          The Leader waves the Lieutenant off.
          
                              HELEN
                    I have something to tell you,
                    something important but --
          
          She glances at Conrad.
          
                              HELEN
                    I can tell you and only you.  In
                    private.
          
          The Leader studies her.
          
                              HELEN
                    It is a matter of national
                    security.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          In his car, Finch races to a corner and slams on the brakes. 
          He gets out, staring at a shadow on the ground: a "V" in a
          circle.
          
          The shadow is cast by a sign for Victoria Station, part of
          the abandoned subway.
          
          The gates are chained shut.  He fires his pistol into the
          lock, kicks open the rusting gates, and descends into the
          underground.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S PRIVATE QUARTERS
          
          The Leader closes the door behind them.
          
                              LEADER
                    Now what's this all about, Mrs.
                    Heyer?
          
                              HELEN
                    Please, forgive me.  I've been so
                    afraid, afraid to come here to talk
                    to you.  I thought he must know.  I
                    was terrified he knew but I had to
                    come because I knew you were the
                    only one that can protect me.
          
                              LEADER
                    Protect you from what?
          
          She is unable to go on, seemingly about to burst into tears.
          
                              LEADER
                    Come now, Mrs. Heyer.
          
          He touches her and it is all she needs.  She buries her face
          into his chest.
          
                              HELEN
                    You won't let him hurt me, will
                    you?
          
                              LEADER
                    Let who hurt you?
          
                              HELEN
                    The terrorist.

                    Oh, how I wanted to believe it,
                    Leader, but I know it's not true.
          
                              LEADER
                    How?
          
                              HELEN
                    Because I know who the terrorist

          INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE
          
          Conrad is alone with Fate.  He glances about nervously,
          moving closer and closer.  His fingers reach out and graze
          the main keyboard.  Taking a deep breath, he turns and begins
          to type.
          
          INT.  PRIVATE QUARTERS

                              HELEN
                    It's Conrad, Leader.  Conrad.  My
                    husband is the terrorist.
          
                              LEADER
                    What?!
          
          INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE
          
          Conrad accesses the department of water and power.  He finds
          the correct file and begins rerouting power to a once dead
          system.
          
          INT.  V'S TRAIN STATION
          
          A hanging light suddenly sizzles to life.  V looks up,
          smiling.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S PRIVATE QUARTERS
          
          The Leader stares hard at Helen.
          
                              LEADER
                    How do you know?
          
                              HELEN
                    I saw him, Leader.  In the middle
                    of the night.  I heard something. 
                    I went to the landing and that's
                    when I saw it.
          
          She clutches him.
          
                              HELEN
                    That mask.  That hideous smiling
                    mask.
          
                              LEADER
                    But how did you know it was Heyer?
          
                              HELEN
                    I know, Leader.  I know the way a
                    woman knows.
          
                              LEADER
                    But you have no proof?
          
                              HELEN
                    Proof?
          
                              LEADER
                    Yes, proof?  This is an extremely
                    delicate situation, Mrs. Heyer.  It
                    has been reported that the
                    terrorist is dead.  It would be a
                    catastrophe to arrest a man now
                    without concrete, conclusive proof. 
                    Do you have any evidence at all?
          
          Tears well up in Helen's eyes as she shakes her head.
          
                              LEADER
                    But if you're right, if Heyer is
                    indeed the terrorist...
          
          His eyes fly wide and he spins away from her, throwing open
          the door.
          
                              HELEN
                    Leader!  Wait!
          
          INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE
          
          Conrad sits calmly across the room.
          
                              CONRAD
                    Is everything all right?  Helen?
          
                              LEADER
                    Yes, Mr. Heyer, your wife has done
                    her duty to her country.
          
          He turns to Helen.
          
                              LEADER
                    Don't worry, Mrs. Heyer.  You will
                    be taken care of.  I will launch an
                    immediate investigation and I
                    promise, you will be the first to
                    know when an arrest will be made.
          
                              CONRAD
                    Investigation of what?
          
                              LEADER
                    Subversion, Mr. Heyer.  Your wife
                    was privy to the dialogue of
                    subversives.  That's all you need
                    to know at this time.  Lieutenant!
          
          The Lieutenant appears almost instantly.
          
                              LEADER
                    The Heyers are leaving.  I need to
                    see Mr. Creedy at once.
          
          Helen looks up at the Leader, a smile hidden near the corners
          of her perfect red lips.
          
                              HELEN
                    Thank you, sir.
          
          The Leader nods.
          
          INT.  NEW GOVERNMENT BUILDING
          
          Helen and Conrad get out of the elevator, standing beneath
          the rows of new party flags that line the lobby.
          
                              HELEN
                    I want you to go straight to your
                    office and wait for me to call. 
                    When I do, I want you to come
                    immediately home.  Understood?
          
                              CONRAD
                    Yes, Helen.
          
          She embraces him, pressing her body against his.
          
                              HELEN
                    Oh, Conrad, I'm so proud of you.
          
                              CONRAD
                    I did it, Helen.  I did it, didn't
                    I?
          
                              HELEN
                    Tonight, Conrad.
          
                              CONRAD
                    Tonight.
          
                              HELEN
                    I promise you will never forget
                    tonight.
          
          She almost kisses him.
          
                              HELEN
                    Goodbye, Conrad.
          
          Smiling, she pivots on her heel and heads for the door.  He
          reaches for her when --
          
                              GUARD
                    Mr. Heyer!  Mr. Heyer!
          
          The front desk guard rushes towards him.
          
                              CONRAD
                    Yes?
          
                              GUARD
                    Sir, this package arrived for you,
                    sir.
          
          He hands him a small, brown wrapped box.
          
                              CONRAD
                    Thank you.
          
          He looks back for Helen but she is already gone.
          
          INT.  SUBWAY
          
          A single flashlight beam creeps toward us as Finch searches
          the detritus of the dead train line.
          
          INT.  CONRAD'S CAR
          
          Sitting at a stoplight, Conrad decides to open the package. 
          Inside is a cassette tape.  The light changes and a car
          behind him honks.  He starts forward and inserts the tape.
          
          INT.  SUBWAY
          
          Finch crawls up onto the platform of V's hidden station,
          staring at the beautiful old train car.
          
          INT.  CONRAD'S CAR
          
          Strangling the steering wheel, Conrad listens to the tape. 
          The speedometer climbs as everything seems to accelerate.
          
                              TAPE (V.O.)
                    Do you know what I want?  I want
                    you just like this... bent over
                    that black leather chair.
          
          Helen moans.
          
          INT.  TRAIN CAR
          
          Finch steps inside the car, his flashlight sweeping over the
          stacks of gelignite.
          
                              FINCH
                    Oh my god.
          
          INT.  CONRAD'S CAR
          
          A scream builds in Conrad.  With tears in his eyes, he stares
          out the windshield but sees only the images created by the
          tape.
          
                              TAPE (V.O.)
                    Use the Finger?... You mean like
                    this?... Oh... That's vulgar... But
                    you like it?... Yes... oh yes.
          
          Conrad loses control and the car careens up onto the sidewalk
          and smashes into a brick wall.
          
          Lifting his bloodied forehead, Conrad looks out and sees the
          ubiquitous poster partially destroyed by the crash: "Strength
          through purity, purity through faith."
          
          INT.  TRAIN CAR
          
          Finch hears something and jerks back, almost falling out of
          the car.  Aiming his gun, he finds no one.  He turns and
          bolts.
          
          As the sound of his footsteps fade, V steps out of the
          shadows.
          
          INT.  NEW GOVERNMENT BUILDING
          
          The Leader's Lieutenant looks up from his desk and sees Finch
          rushing towards him.
          
                              FINCH
                    Is the Leader in?
          
                              LIEUTENANT
                    Yes, but he's meeting with the
                    Captain of the Guard.
          
                              FINCH
                    Perfect.
          
                              LIEUTENANT
                    Mr. Finch, you can't go in --
          
          Finch charges through the doors.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE
          
          The Leader and his Captain turn.
          
                              LEADER
                    Mr. Finch?
          
                              FINCH
                    Leader, I need as many men the
                    Captain can spare and I need them
                    right now.
          
                              CAPTAIN
                    What for?
          
                              FINCH
                    To capture codename V.
          
          EXT.  CONRAD'S HOUSE
          
          Creedy opens the trunk of his car.  In the phosphorescent
          glow of the streetlight, the set of knives gleam.  He bundles
          the costume that he tried to planet on Finch into his arms,
          then slams the trunk.
          
          Above, a window blind that was cracked open snaps shut.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE
          
          The Leader moves towards Finch.
          
                              FINCH
                    He's underground.  The old subway. 
                    I know exactly what he's going to
                    do.  If we move quickly, we can be
                    there, waiting for him.
          
          INT.  CONRAD'S HOUSE
          
          Conrad waits, hidden inside a bedroom closet.  He hears the
          front door close and his grip tightens around the handle of a
          long, steel-necked hammer.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE
          
          The Leader is steadily convincing himself of something.
          
                              FINCH
                    Leader, every second we delay...
          
          The Leader lifts his hand, silencing Finch.
          
                              LEADER
                    I'm coming with you.
          
                              GUARD
                    Sir --
          
                              LEADER
                    There will be no discussion --
          
                              GUARD
                    But if Mr. Finch is right --
          
                              LEADER
                    I am sick to death of this
                    terrorist being everywhere and
                    nowhere!  I will judge whether Mr.
                    Finch is right and I will judge it
                    with my own eyes!  Do I make myself
                    clear, Captain?
          
                              CAPTAIN
                    Sir, yes, sir!
          
          Finch is suddenly overwhelmed by a feeling that is common to
          chess players.  It is the disturbing sense that you have just
          done exactly what your opponent wanted.
          
                              LEADER
                    Is there a problem, Mr. Finch?
          
                              FINCH
                    No... no sir.
          
                              LEADER
                    Good.  Captain, mobilize your men.
          
                              CAPTAIN
                    Sir, yes, sir.
          
                              LEADER
                    We'll find this bloody bastard and
                    we will finish him.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          Evey sits in the gallery, reading Pynchon's "V" just as V had
          done.  She suddenly feels V watching her.
          
                              EVEY
                    V?

                    V, what's going to happen?

                    Change, Evey.  That's all.  Just
                    change.
          
                              EVEY
                    Is it going to be violent?
          
                              V
                    Yes, I suppose it will.

          Creedy empties a bottom drawer, making room to hide the

          creeps open.

          V stands at the jukebox.
          
                              EVEY
                    But why?  Why must is be violent?
          
                              V
                    Because, Evey, that is the nature
                    of change.  She is a temperamental
                    creature that appears in earnest
                    rarely but, when she does, she will
                    wear one of two faces.  The first
                    face is the destroyer.  It is
                    lamentable but all true change
                    begins with death.
          
          INT.  CONRAD'S HOUSE
          
          A dark figure stands over Creedy.  The hammer raises, a slash
          of silver against the velvety darkness.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          V punches a button on the jukebox just as --
          
          INT.  CONRAD'S HOUSE
          
          The hammer falls with a sickening soft crunch.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          The song begins to play; a melancholy song that says goodbye
          to love.
          
          INT.  CONRAD'S HOUSE
          
          Blood pours down Creedy's snarling face, he snatches one of
          V's knives as another hammer blow cracks through his collar
          bone.
          
          He screams, lunging at Conrad.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          V listens to the song, the smiling eyes somehow knowing.
          
          INT.  CONRAD'S HOUSE
          
          The hammer falls again and again until the metal head is
          slick with blood and meat.
          
          Conrad stumbles back, dropping the hammer.  He looks down at
          the hilt of the knife protruding from his stomach.  He yanks
          it out and holds V's knife which is bright red with his own
          blood.
          
          He collapses to the floor.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          The song continues.
          
                              EVEY
                    What is the other face, V?
          
                              V
                    The other face?  She is the true
                    face of change.  The face of the
                    creator.  She is the one that
                    remakes the world.  Evey?
          
                              EVEY
                    Yes, V?
          
                              V
                    May I ask you for a favor?
          
                              EVEY
                    Of course.
          
                              V
                    It is a small thing but it would
                    mean a great deal to me.
          
                              EVEY
                    Tell me.
          
                              V
                    I've never danced before.  I've
                    thought about it many times, here
                    in this room, listening to the
                    music.  But I've always been alone.
          
          Evey smiles and crosses to him.
          
                              EVEY
                    It would be my pleasure.
          
          He opens his arms and she steps into them.  They dance,
          standing very close, his gloved hand holding tightly to hers,
          her smile against his.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          Dozens of military vehicles swarm around the entrance to
          Victoria Station while heavily armed men pour through the
          gates of the underground.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          The song ends.
          
                              V
                    Thank you, Evey.  You are an
                    excellent dancer.
          
                              EVEY
                    All it takes is a little practice.
          
                              V
                    Alas, I have run out of time.
          
          He bows, pressing his frozen lips to her hand.  Evey is
          suddenly nervous.
          
                              EVEY
                    V?  What are you going to do?
          
                              V
                    Don't you remember?  I have a date
                    tonight, Evey.
          
                              EVEY
                    You're coming back though, aren't
                    you?
          
          She seizes hold of his hand.
          
                              EVEY
                    V, I won't let you leave unless you
                    promise me that you will come back.
          
                              V
                    Of course, I'll be back.  You don't
                    think you can be rid of me now, do
                    you?
          
                              EVEY
                    Just promise.
          
                              V
                    I promise.
          
          She lets him go.
          
          INT.  TRAIN STATION
          
          Soldiers swarm through the station.  Susan stares in shock,
          outraged by the mere presence of the train.
          
                              LEADER
                    Mark my words, Mr. Finch, this man
                    is going to become an example so
                    that every man, woman, and child in
                    this country will remember what
                    happens to those who would ever
                    think to stand against the state.
          
          He turns to the Captain.
          
                              LEADER
                    Captain, I need a gas unit down
                    here with enough nerve gas to fill
                    every rat-hole in these tunnels.
          
          Suddenly the lights go out.
          
                              FINCH
                    I don't think that will be
                    necessary.
          
          The Leader smiles.
          
                              LEADER
                    There are over one hundred of the
                    best trained soldiers in this
                    country down here.  Let him come.
          
          INT.  TRAIN TUNNELS
          
          Five soldiers creep forward in a tight formation, their
          flashlights probing every nook and cranny.
          
          Behind them, a secret passage opens and V steps out.
          
          He is among them with frightful speed, a grinning dervish
          with blades like metal fangs ripping and rending flesh,
          slashing bright in the flashlight.
          
          Other soldiers rush towards the screams and gunfire but they
          find only five bodies and warm blood running down the walls.
          
                              LEADER
                    Captain, what's happening?
          
                              RADIO (V.O.)
                    No sign sir.  Repeat, no sign of
                    him.
          
                              CAPTAIN
                    They lost him.
          
          From the opposite end, there is another series of screams and
          machine gun fire that lights up the dark tunnel for a moment. 
          Then, nothing.
          
                              FINCH
                    This... this is a mistake.
          
                              LEADER
                    Don't tell me you're a coward, Mr.
                    Finch.
          
          Back in the tunnels, V drops from above, his cloak a swirling
          cloud of squid ink that hides him in the darkness.
          
          Again, quicksilver knives lash out, drawing fonts of blood.
          
          INT.  TRAIN STATION
          
          Finch can feel the panic that is spreading through the
          tunnel.
          
                              FINCH
                    Leader, we have to get out of here!
          
                              LEADER
                    This was your idea.
          
                              FINCH
                    It was a mistake.  This is what he
                    wants.  He knows us, Leader.  He
                    knows us too well.  We have to get
                    out of here before it's too late --
          
          A voice rings out from hidden speakers, echoing through the
          tunnels.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    Good evening citizens of London. 
                    This is the voice of Fate.  Your
                    fate...
          
                              LEADER
                    What trick is this?
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    Tonight, the face of London is
                    going to change and I am going to
                    offer you the chance to change with
                    her.  Your Leader is finished.  He
                    will not leave these tunnels alive.
          
          The Leader screams to be heard over the resonant voice of V.
          
                              LEADER
                    This is an outrage!  I order you
                    not to listen to this!
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    At midnight tonight, the Head will
                    be destroyed and a new era will
                    begin.  You must now decide if you
                    are going to be a part of that era.
          
          Everywhere, terrified soldiers listen to the voice.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    You can choose to stay here and die
                    with your Leader or you can choose
                    to be free.  The decision is yours
                    and yours alone.
          
                              LEADER
                    Captain, order all your men to fall
                    back and secure this position!
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    Some of you have wives.  Some of
                    you have families.  All of you have
                    lives.  Consider each of them as
                    you ask yourself, are they a part
                    of the past, or are they a part of
                    the future?
          
                              CAPTAIN
                    Fall back.  Fall back and secure
                    the central platform.
          
          Deep in the tunnel, two soldiers look at each other. 
          Simultaneously, they drop their guns and run.
          
                              LEADER
                    Any man that disobeys this order
                    will be court marshaled!
          
          Groups of solders drop their weapons and disappear into the
          shadows.
          
                              LEADER
                    Captain!  Captain, where are your
                    men?
          
          The station fills with the sound of boots running wildly
          away.
          
                              LEADER
                    Goddammit, I will not tolerate this
                    insubordination!  I want those
                    deserters shot, Captain.
          
          Finch slowly draws back away from the Leader.
          
                              LEADER
                    Shot on sight!
          
          The few men on the platform are soon the only men left.
          
                              CAPTAIN
                    You!  You!  Point position.  We're
                    getting out of here!  Now!
          
          A knife sings through the air and buries itself in the
          Captain's chest.  With a tiny rasp, he falls to the ground.
          
          The remaining men bolt.
          
                              LEADER
                    Traitors!  You cowards!
          
          He grabs for the Captain's machine gun.
          
                              LEADER
                    I know who you are!  I'll see you
                    hang!  Every last one of you!
          
          "You" echoes down the dark empty throat of the tunnel.
          
          The Leader looks around, his flashlight sweeping in big arcs
          as he realizes that he is alone.
          
                              LEADER
                    Finch?  Finch!  Finch, goddammit,
                    you can't leave me!  Don't leave
                    me!
          
                              V
                    You are going to die as you ruled --
          
          The Leader screams, whipping around towards the voice.
          
                              V
                    Alone.
          
          The smile is as cold and as sharp as the knife that flicks
          from his hand.
          
          The Leader raises his gun just when the knife sinks into his
          shoulder.
          
          Howling in pain, he drops the gun.
          
                              LEADER
                    Damn you!  Damn you!
          
          V smiles into the spot of his flashlight.
          
                              LEADER
                    Conrad?  Is that you?  You're
                    working with Finch, aren't you? 
                    And Creedy!  You're all in this
                    together!
          
          V closes in.
          
                              LEADER
                    Who are you?
          
                              V
                    You, most of all, should know,
                    Leader.  You created me.  Without
                    you, I would never be.  More than
                    life, Leader, you gave me purpose.
          
          V draws his final blade.
          
                              V
                    "He that killeth with the sword,
                    shall be killed with the sword."
          
          V raises the knife.
          
                              LEADER
                    Noooo!
          
                              FINCH
                    Don't move!
          
          V and the Leader turn to find Finch aiming a machine gun at
          V.
          
                              LEADER
                    Mr. Finch!  Oh god, Mr. Finch!
          
                              FINCH
                    Drop the knife.
          
          V does and Susan begins an almost hysterical laugh.
          
                              LEADER
                    Oh, I knew it, Mr. Finch.  I knew
                    you wouldn't desert me.  You're a
                    good man, Finch.  A damn good man.
          
                              FINCH
                    No, Mr. Susan.  No, I'm not.  I'm a
                    man who does his job and does what
                    he's told.  For twenty seven years,
                    that's all I've been.
          
          He steps toward V, staring into his smiling black eyes.
          
                              LEADER
                    Careful, Mr. Finch.  He's quick as
                    the devil.
          
          Finch ignores the Leader.
          
                              FINCH
                    I've read Delia's diary over and
                    over all year.  It sickens me but I
                    am unable to judge her.  I am as
                    guilty as she.
          
                              LEADER
                    Mr. Finch, what are you doing? 
                    Shoot him.  Kill the bastard,
                    Finch.
          
                              FINCH
                    I have no excuse.  I did what I was
                    told to do.
          
                              LEADER
                    Finch, I order you to shoot him! 
                    Finch!
          
                              FINCH
                    My job was to find you and catch
                    you.  I've done my job.  I've done
                    it for the last time.  I'm tired of
                    it.  I'm tired of it all.
          
          He tosses the gun to the Leader.
          
                              FINCH
                    Kill him yourself if you can.
          
          The Leader seethes, his eyes boring into Finch.
          
                              FINCH
                    Thank you, V.  And goodbye.
          
                              V
                    Goodbye, Mr. Finch.
          
          The machine gun burst shatters the quiet concrete silence. 
          Finch falls dead at V's feet.
          
                              LEADER
                    I warned you, Finch, the penalty
                    for treason is death.
          
          He aims the gun at V.
          
                              LEADER
                    Are you ready to die?
          
                              V
                    The real question is, are you?
          
          The Leader laughs.
          
                              LEADER
                    Do you really believe you can pick
                    up that knife before I pull this
                    trigger?
          
                              V
                    No.  But I don't have to.
          
          Almost casually, V bends down to pick up the knife --
          
          The Leader screams and fires.
          
          Bullets knock V back a bit but he continues, grabbing the
          knife and standing.
          
          Eyes widening with disbelief, the Leader fires another blast
          as V begins walking towards him.
          
          The machine gun roars, bullets shredding out through the back
          of V's cloak as he continues with short deliberate steps
          until --
          
          The hammer clicks against the pin.  The gun is empty.
          
          V stands before him.
          
                              V
                    You see?  You cannot kill me. 
                    There is no flesh and blood within
                    this cloak to kill.  There is only
                    an idea.
          
          V smiles.
          
                              V
                    And ideas are bulletproof.
          
          The Leader screams.
          
          V drives the knife into his heart, killing him instantly.
          
          V stands alone amidst the carnage and seeping pools of red.
          
          His body wavers.  He takes his hands out from beneath his
          cloak and reveals his gloves, wet with blood.
          
          INT.  CONRAD'S HOUSE
          
          The front door opens and Helen enters.
          
                              HELEN
                    Creedy?  Creedy, you dumb bastard,
                    you left your car parked in front.
          
          She walks up the stairs to the bedroom.
          
                              HELEN
                    What did I tell you?  Creedy.
          
          INT.  BEDROOM
          
          She steps into the room, her sole and heel sinking into the
          plush carpet soaked with blood.
          
                              HELEN
                    Oh my god.
          
          When she sees Creedy's head mashed open, she covers her
          mouth.
          
                              CONRAD
                    Helen...
          
          Conrad has propped himself against the bed.
          
                              HELEN
                    Conrad!  What have you done?
          
                              CONRAD
                    I won, Helen.  I did it.  I won. 
                    I'm the better man.
          
          He crawls toward her, slipping on the wet carpet.
          
                              CONRAD
                    We've been through a bad patch,
                    Helen.  But now, he's gone...
                    There's nothing to come between
                    us...
          
          He reaches for her foot, his hand gloved with wet red.
          
                              HELEN
                    Don't touch me!  You stupid piece
                    of shit!  You've ruined it!  I had
                    it all planned perfectly and you've
                    ruined it!
          
          She checks her watch; two hours to midnight.
          
                              HELEN
                    I have to get out of here!  I have
                    to get away!
          
          Conrad seizes hold of her ankle.
          
                              CONRAD
                    Helen --
          
                              HELEN
                    No!  Let go!  Now!
          
          The look in his eyes frightens her.  She tries to kick free
          of him but he won't let go.  Twisting, she reaches for the
          door but slips on the carpet.
          
                              HELEN
                    Conrad, damn you!  Let me go!
          
                              CONRAD
                    No, Helen, you're not leaving me...
                    not this time... not ever.
          
          He crawls up her body still clutching the bloody knife.
          
                              HELEN
                    No, please!  Oh god, no!  Oh god,
                    please help me!
          
          Conrad raises the knife.
          
                              CONRAD
                    No one can help us, Helen.  God is
                    dead.
          
          The knife falls.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          Evey hears V on the spiral staircase.
          
                              EVEY
                    V?
          
          Scarlet footprints trail behind V as he struggles down the
          stairs.
          
                              EVEY
                    You came back.
          
          He nods and then collapses, rolling down the rest of the
          stairs.
          
                              EVEY
                    V!  V!
          
          Running to him, she falls to his side.  His clothes are slick
          with blood.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh god, what happened?
          
                              V
                    Evey...
          
                              EVEY
                    You need a doctor.
          
                              V
                    It's too late for that...
          
                              EVEY
                    No, don't say that!
          
                              V
                    Evey, listen to me.  I've not long
                    and there are things that must be
                    said.
          
          His voice strains beneath the mask.
          
                              V
                    I have done that which I came to
                    do.  Now, it is time for me to rest
                    and with me the past will, at last,
                    find peace.
          
          Trembling, Evey holds him.
          
                              V
                    But the world, the world is not
                    saved... Do not think that, when
                    the fires die and the smoke clears,
                    there is no miracle... there is
                    only a path... upon which they must
                    learn to rule themselves.
          
                              EVEY
                    Yes, they need you, V.
          
                              V
                    Not me, Evey, not me.  I told you I
                    am the villain.  The destroyer...
                    But yes, they will need help...
          
          He reaches up and wipes a tear from her cheek.
          
                              V
                    I kept my promise to you, Evey...
                    Now you must promise me.
          
                              EVEY
                    What?
          
                              V
                    Promise me... you will discover the
                    face under this mask... but you
                    will never look beneath it.
          
                              EVEY
                    I don't understand.
          
                              V
                    Promise me.  Please...
          
                              EVEY
                    I promise.
          
                              V
                    Sweet Eve.  Wherever I shall go, I
                    shall always love you.
          
                              EVEY
                    V, you are not going anywhere!
          
                              V
                    Midnight... Midnight.  Eve... Make
                    them remember...
          
                              EVEY
                    You're not going to die, V!
          
                              V
                    Let me be there, Evey, when it
                    begins... Please, let me hear the
                    music, one last time... my music...
          
                              EVEY
                    I won't let you die!
          
                              V
                    I know you won't... I know...
          
                              EVEY
                    V!
          
                              V
                    My love... Ave Atque vale...
          
          Holding him as tight as she can, she feels his life drain
          away, slipping through her arms in the way the last grains of
          sand pour through the neck of the hourglass.
          
          She buries her face beside his and weeps.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          An enormous crowd has begun to gather in the streets
          surrounding the New Government Building.  With the crowd, a
          restlessness swells against each barricade erected by the
          military.
          
          A sergeant stands on an armored car, speaking through a
          megaphone.
          
                              SERGEANT
                    Return to your homes!  There is
                    nothing to see!  The terrorist is
                    dead!
          
                              RABBLE ROUSER 1
                    He ain't dead!
          
                              RABBLE ROUSER 2
                    He'll be here, just like he said!
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          Evey huddles against the stair railing, her face tear
          stained, staring at the lifeless body of V.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I remember... I remember staring at
                    the mask, at that smile.
          
          She touches the mask, her fingers finding its edge.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Part of me couldn't believe he was
                    dead and maybe that was why.  The
                    smile was still the same. 
                    It made me want to tear it off so I
                    could see the face, so I could see
                    that he was dead.
          
          Her fingers stop.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    But I had promised.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    You will discover the face under
                    this mask but you will never look
                    beneath it.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I began to try to imagine his face. 
                    Of course, I had long pictured my
                    father behind that smile but I knew
                    in my heart that V was not my
                    father.
          
          Evey stares into the eyes, the dark, empty eyes.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Yet every time I pictured another
                    face, any face, something was lost,
                    something important was somehow
                    diminished.  V was more than a
                    face.  V was V.
          
          Her expression changes.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    And then, quite suddenly, quite
                    naturally, I realized whose face
                    must be beneath that mask.  It was
                    the only face that mattered.
          
                              EVEY
                    I won't let you die.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    I know you won't... I know.
          
          A small smile creeps across her face.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          Midnight approaches and the crowd feels it.  Spilling
          everywhere, they fill the streets like a flood.
          
          INT.  TRAIN CAR
          
          Evey sets a final violet carson on the chest of V.  He is
          lying on a bed made of gelignite, covered in roses.
          
          Touching his mask, she bends over him.
          
                              EVEY
                    Goodbye, my love.
          
          Tenderly, she presses her lips to the smile, her eyes
          closing, her final tears blinking free.
          
          She backs away and V smiles, his lips wet with her kiss, his
          cheek wet with her tears.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    "Ave Atque vale."
          
          On the train platform, Evey reaches through the window and
          starts the train.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I looked it up the next morning.
          
          The wheels churn as the train lurches forward.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    "Hail and farewell."
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    "Make them remember..."
          
          She watches the train disappear into the tunnel.
          
                              EVEY
                    They will, my love.  They will.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          The crowd surges against a barricade when a voice cries out
          across the city echoing through the megaphone on every
          corner.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    "Remember, remember, the fifth of
                    November!"
          
          High above the gathered mass, a masked figure steps out onto
          a roof parapet.
          
          The crowd explodes.
          
          INT.  SUBWAY
          
          The train barrels along, screaming against its rusted rails.
          
          EXT.  ROOFTOP
          
          Dressed as V, Evey stands on the roof's edge, speaking into a
          microphone.
          
                              EVEY
                    I have come here tonight to keep a
                    promise.  A promise that is over
                    four hundred years old.  Tonight I
                    am here to give you your freedom!
          
          Again, the crowd bursts into a frenzy.
          
                              EVEY
                    Since mankind's dawn a handful of
                    oppressors have accepted the
                    responsibility over our lives,
                    responsibility that we should have
                    accepted ourselves.  By doing so,
                    they took our power.  By doing
                    nothing, we gave it away.
          
          The voice booms over the mesmerized crowd.
          
                              EVEY
                    Tonight, our world will change. 
                    Our leaders will be gone and we
                    must choose what comes next.  A
                    return to the chains of others or
                    lives of our own.  A world of the
                    past or one of the future.
          
          She feels the sea of humanity beneath her, almost channeling
          their energy.
          
                              EVEY
                    Let us choose carefully, London,
                    and when we do, let us mark well
                    and remember, remember this fifth
                    of November!
          
          The crowd screams as one and their scream becomes --
          
          INT.  SUBWAY
          
          The train hurling like a bullet through a gun barrel.  Ahead
          the tracks end, buried beneath the rubble of the collapsed
          tunnel.
          
          INT.  TRAIN CAR
          
          Inside the rattling train, V lays in perfect repose.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    Let me be there, Evey, when it
                    begins...
          
          EXT.  ROOFTOPS
          
          Hidden and alone, Evey pulls the mask from her face.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    Please let me hear the music... one
                    last time... my music.
          
          Almost unconsciously, Evey raises her hand and coaxes the
          first soft notes as he had once done.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    At first, you have to listen
                    carefully.
          
          The violins of the 1812 overture steadily rise.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    Ah, yes.  There it is.  Beautiful,
                    is it not?
          
          Evey smiles, her hand still gently conducting.
          
                              EVEY
                    Yes, my love.  Yes it is.
          
          INT.  SUBWAY
          
          With the clash of cymbals, the train crashes into the wall of
          rubble.
          
          EXT.  NEW GOVERNMENT BUILDING
          
          The entire building opens like a time-lapsed rose blooming
          with brilliant orange petals of flame.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          The crowd is awash in the baptismal glow of erupting flame.
          
          EXT.  ROOFTOP
          
          Evey watches the explosion, a star-burst of flaming debris
          searing against the night sky like fireworks.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          The masses burst through the barricades with a euphoric
          frenzy.
          
          EXT.  ROOFTOP
          
          The explosion begins to slowly die.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I know that there is only one way
                    to repay him for what he did.
          
          She looks down at the mask.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    And I know that that way is going
                    to take a lot of hard work.
          
          She smiles.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I know this like I know the sun
                    will rise tomorrow and beneath that
                    new sun, our work will begin.
          
          The fire fades and Evey turns, cradling the mask, and walks
          away.
          
                                                          FADE OUT.

                                         January 8, 2007


   I swear by God this sacred oath:

   That I shall render unconditional obedience to
   Adolf Hitler, the Führer of the German Reich, and
   that I shall at all times be prepared, as a brave
   soldier, to give my life for this oath.


1   BLACK                                                   1

    And from out of the blackness a voice. A man speaking
    in German - faint at first, crackling over the radio.
    Subtitles translate the voice of Adolf Hitler.

                       HITLER (V.O.)
            My comrades. Once again - I don't
            know how many times it has been now
            - an attempt has been made on my
            life. I speak to you tonight for
            two reasons. First, so that you can
            hear my voice and know that I am
            unhurt. And second, so that you may
            know the details of a crime without
            parallel in German history...


2   EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY                                     2

    TITLES: SMOLENSK, RUSSIA - THE GERMAN EASTERN FRONT.
    13 MARCH 1943.

    A lonely airfield. A NAZI OFFICER and his AIDE stand
    rigid by a gleaming limousine. The officer's uniform
    denotes a man of high rank - a man of weight.

    TITLES: MAJOR-GENERAL HENNING VON TRESCKOW - CHIEF OF
    STAFF FOR ARMY GROUP CENTER.

    Tresckow smokes a cigarette, his arm the only
    movement in the frame.

    PULL BACK TO REVEAL the airstrip is surrounded by
    Army Group vehicles and personnel - SD and SS
    escorts, photographers, aides, Nazi party
    dignitaries, etc. - all frozen like statues. Eerie.
    Whatever is going on, it's big. The faint sound of
    distant airplanes brings tension, subtle but sharp.

    Approaching the field are three Focke-Wulf 200
    Condors escorted by a formation of Messerschmitt-109
    fighters. Silence gives way to an escalating roar
    that seems to have no maximum. One by one, the
    massive four-engine Condors land while the fighters
    roar overhead and circle the airfield. The Condors
    come to rest and, needing no introduction:

    ADOLF HITLER alights from the lead plane, obscured by
    the surrounding platoon of heavily armed SS GUARDS.

    (Note: Hitler is obscured throughout the entire
    sequence proving how inaccessible he truly was.)

                                                         2.



    Tresckow and his Aide step forward to greet Hitler,
    but they are pushed back by SS guards. The Führer
    marches past without so much a glance at his hosts or
    their waiting limo.

    To Tresckow's surprise, a second limousine roars onto
    the airfield from out of nowhere. It is dirty, the
    windscreen spotted with bugs from a long drive.
    Hitler gets in the dirty car and speeds off.

                       VOICE (O.S.)
           It's not so much your car he
           doesn't trust... It's your driver.

    Tresckow and his Aide turn. Standing behind them is:

    TITLES: COLONEL HEINZ BRANDT - SENIOR STAFF OFFICER
    OF THE ARMY OPERATIONS SECTION.

    The consummate Nazi, he is always scribbling notes in           
    a small datebook. Without looking up, Brandt hops               
    into the limo they brought for Hitler.                          

    Tresckow and his Aide share a glance and get in. A
    beat later they are speeding after Hitler's car.


3   EXT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - DAY                              3

    Est. Hitler's headquarters for the Eastern Front is
    bustling. Security is tight, everyone is on edge.


4   INT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - MESS HALL - DAY                  4

    Long tables packed with SOLDIERS straining their
    necks to get a glimpse of their leader at the head
    table, but he is obscured by his detail of SS guards.
    ONE MAN dares to approach. The room falls silent.

    HITLER'S PERSONAL CHEF places a tray before the
    Führer, producing a knife and fork, cutting a bite.
    We think he is going to hand feed Hitler until he
    places the food in his own mouth, chewing slowly,
    deliberately. He swallows. We wait for him to die.
    When he doesn't, Hitler begins to eat. The rest of
    the room relaxes slightly and digs in.

    ANGLE ON: Seated further down the table are Tresckow
    and his Aide. Between them, once again, is Brandt,
    eating like a pig, still making notes in his book.              
    Tresckow stares.                                                

                                                        3.



                         TRESCKOW
           Managing the Führer's security must
           be quite an undertaking.

                         BRANDT
                   (in between mouthfuls)
           Irregularity is the Führer's                            
           precaution of choice.

                         TRESCKOW
           I can assure you he's safe here.
           Relax, Brandt. Enjoy your meal.

    Brandt's look says, "Don't be ridiculous." He cleans
    his plate in seconds. Then he gently dabs his mouth,
    takes out his datebook and starts writing - once
    again the precise man we saw on the airfield.

                    TRESCKOW (CONT'D)
           I understand you're returning to
           Berlin this afternoon...

    Brandt nods.

                    TRESCKOW (CONT'D)
           Could I trouble you to deliver a
           package to Colonel Stieff?

    Brandt nods again, too busy writing to notice the
    knowing glance Tresckow shares with his Aide...


5   INT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - PRIVATE OFFICE - LATER          5

    Tense silence. Tresckow and his Aide are hunched over
    two bottles of Cointreau on a large desk next to:

    TWO PAIRS OF BRITISH `CLAMS' - a small black plastic           
    casing held together by magnets and adhesive tape.             

    Tresckow inserts a short, pencil-shaped fuse through
    the narrow opening. All that remains exposed is a
    small glass capsule. The trigger. Tresckow turns his
    attention to the bottles of Cointreau...


6   EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY                                      6

    The Condors' engines roar, ready for take off.
    Soldiers stand at attention as Hitler boards. Brandt
    is with him, scribbling in his ever-present datebook.

                                                         4.



    Tresckow and his Aide approach. Tresckow gently
    handles a carefully wrapped package.

    CLOSE ON: Tresckow presses a key against the side of
    the package, crushing the glass capsule inside. The
    explosive armed now, he hands it to Brandt.

                         TRESCKOW
           With my regards to Colonel Stieff.

    Brandt accepts the gift, looking up from his book. He
    studies the familiar shape.

                          BRANDT
           Cointreau? You better hope I don't
           get thirsty on the flight.

    Tresckow politely smiles, hiding his nerves, having
    just handed a bomb to Hitler's Head of Security.
    Brandt unknowingly carries it onto the plane with
    Hitler. The door to the Condor is sealed behind him
    along with, we hope, the Führer's fate.

    Tresckow looks at his watch and we DISSOLVE TO:                   


7   INT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - PRIVATE OFFICE - LATER             7

    A clock shows us that thirty minutes have passed.

    Tresckow and his Aide are seated on either side of a
    desk staring at the telephone. Smoking. Waiting...

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:


8   INT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - PRIVATE OFFICE - LATER             8

    Three hours later. The ashtray is overflowing but
    Tresckow and his Aide have not moved. Finally...

    The phone barely rings before Tresckow answers. He
    doesn't say a word, he only nods and hangs up.

                        TRESCKOW
           He's... landed.                                            

    It takes a moment for the gravity of this to set in.

                           AIDE
           What about the...

    Tresckow is already dialing the telephone.

                                                          5.



                          TRESCKOW
            Get me Colonel Brandt...
                        (staying cool)
            Colonel? Tresckow... I trust you
            landed safely... I hate to trouble
            you but there's been a bit of a mix
            up. It seems you have the wrong
            bottles for Colonel Stieff. You...
            do still have the package?

     Long pause. Torture. Then:

                     TRESCKOW (CONT'D)
            I can be at your office first thing
            tomorrow morning to pick it up.
            Terribly sorry for the
            inconvenience... Thank you.

     Tresckow slowly hangs up the phone.

                            AIDE
            Do you think he knows?

     Tresckow shrugs, opening a bottle of Cointreau and
     pouring two glasses with a shaking hand.

                          TRESCKOW
            There's only one way to be sure...


9    EXT. OKH HEADQUARTERS - DAY                               9

     Est. An early morning fog blankets the ground,
     obscuring our view. Eerie.


10   INT. OKH HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - DAY                     10

     Footsteps echo through the cavernous hallways.
     Tresckow marches with purpose through the numerous
     security checkpoints. It is a long, suspenseful walk.
     He is aware of someone walking up behind him, getting
     closer. We think he's done for, but a BESPECTACLED,
     MIDDLE-AGED OFFICER overtakes him and whispers:

                             OFFICER                                  
            What happened?                                            

     TITLES: GENERAL FRIEDRICH OLBRICHT - CHIEF OF GENERAL            
     ARMY OFFICE IN BERLIN.                                           

                                                     6.



                     TRESCKOW                               
       I can only guess the altitude                        
       caused the fuse to malfunction.                      
       First the beer hall, Memorial Day -                  
       now this. Someone is watching over                   
       that sonofabitch, I swear it.                        

                     OLBRICHT                               
       We've been discovered.                               

Tresckow halts and faces Olbricht, expressionless.          

                     TRESCKOW                               
       What makes you think-

                    OLBRICHT
       Oster's been arrested. The Gestapo
       came for him last night.

Tresckow thinks for a beat and resumes walking.
Olbricht hurries after him.

                OLBRICHT (CONT'D)
       Did you hear what I said?

                     TRESCKOW
       The Gestapo could have arrested him
       for anything. Find a replacement.                    

                    OLBRICHT
       There's no one we can trust. Not in                  
       Berlin.                                              

                     TRESCKOW
       Then stop looking in Berlin.                         

Just then, they approach the final threshold, a             
SENTRY guards an office marked:

COLONEL HEINZ BRANDT.

Olbricht stops, regarding the door with dread. But          
Tresckow presses on, reaching the door, about to
enter when:

                      SENTRY
       Your pistol please.

Oh shit. Tresckow plays it cool, removing his pistol
from its holster and handing it over.                       

And with a nod to Olbricht, Tresckow squares his
shoulders and enters Brandt's office.

                                                        7.




11   INT. OKH HEADQUARTERS - BRANDT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS    11

     Brandt is at his desk, writing as always. Tresckow
     notices Brandt's pistol sitting within arm's reach. A
     clock ticks loudly. Imagine it. Then wait. Finally:            

     Brandt puts his pen down, stands and salutes, but the          
     gesture is almost casual. Pure formality.                      

                           BRANDT                                   
            You'll forgive me, General. This                        
            little round-up has had me writing                      
            reports all day.                                        

                           TRESKOW                                  
            Round-up?                                               

                           BRANDT                                   
            Dissenters. A plot against the                          
            Führer.                                                 

     Tresckow makes a good show of laughing that off.               

                          TRESKOW                                   
            Who would even have the balls?                          

                           BRANDT                                   
            You'd be surprised, the number of                       
            cowards in this army that would be                      
            willing to stand against the Reich.                     

                          TRESKOW                                   
            Only if the Führer were dead, of                        
            course.                                                 

                           BRANDT                                   
            Of course. It's one thing to think                      
            you know what's right. What matters                     
            is having the strength to do it.                        

     Clunk. Brandt produces the package, putting it on the          
     desk in front of him.                                          

                      BRANDT (CONT'D)                               
            Is this what you've come for?                           

     Pause. Staying cool, Tresckow reaches for it:                  

                      BRANDT (CONT'D)                               
            Perhaps we should open it.

     Tresckow freezes, studies Brandt's cold smile.

                                                          8.



                          TRESCKOW
            I beg your pardon.

     Brandt sits back, smiles. Does he know?                          

                           BRANDT
            You've come a long way. You must be
            thirsty.

                          TRESCKOW
            I wonder how the Führer, who does
            not partake, would feel about an
            officer who did so on duty...
            Colonel Brandt.

     Brandt's smile fades. We can't decide why. He picks
     up the package carelessly. Tresckow stays cool
     despite the armed explosive just a few feet away.

                           BRANDT
            I took you for another sort,
            General.                                                  

     And we realize he really did just want a drink. He
     knows nothing about what the package hides.

                          TRESCKOW
            And I you.

     Tresckow reaches out, grabbing the package and:                  

     BANG. The sound of an EXPLOSION O.S. takes us to:

     TITLES: TUNISIA, NORTH AFRICA - THE RETREATING 10TH
     PANZER DIVISION. 7 APRIL 1943.

     Moving rapidly through an olive grove in the
     otherwise wasted desert. A column of tanks, trucks
     and heavy equipment flow by with a sense of barely
     contained chaos. Men dismantle tents from around
     others dumping documents into burning oil drums.

     In the middle of it we find a tall, handsome young
     officer (age 35). He wears an Afrika Korps uniform
     complete with Colonel's badges, staying cooler than
     the other side of your pillow. He directs men this
     way and that, holding back panic.                                

     TITLES: COLONEL CLAUS VON STAUFFENBERG - STAFF

                                                     9.



A jeep speeds up to him from the distance, driven by
a YOUNG LIEUTENANT.

                 YOUNG LIEUTENANT
       Colonel Stauffenberg, sir. A new
       headquarters has been established
       at Mezzouna. I'm to take you there.

Stauffenberg looks over the scene, expressionless.

                  STAUFFENBERG
       Now they tell us to disengage - a
       day late. No matter how many times
       we tell Command the reality, they
       always manage to leave us-

But he stops himself, containing his rage.

                 YOUNG LIEUTENANT
       Colonel, the enemy is less than
       five kilometers from here. You've
       done all you can.

Stauffenberg glances at his right hand, contemplating
a ring on his finger. After a beat:

                   STAUFFENBERG
       I wonder... Was there even a point
       in our coming to Tunis?

                YOUNG LIEUTENANT
       To get taken prisoner, it seems.

Stauffenberg smiles bitterly and gets in the jeep as:

BOOM. The first bomb explodes before we even see the
tight formation of BRITISH FIRE-BOMBERS overhead.
Fighter planes strafe with machine-guns. Artillery
blasts strike in front and behind the retreating
column. The 10th Panzer Division is trapped.

Panic hits the column like a tidal wave. Stauffenberg
taps the Young Lieutenant who drives into the melee.

Soldiers abandon their vehicles but cover is in short
supply and many are left in the open. So they run.
Dozens are gunned down by the assailing fighters. The
survivors watch in horror as the fighters slowly turn
to make another run. In a panic, the soldiers run the
other direction, halted by a jeep blocking the way.

Stauffenberg stands in the passenger seat.

                                                        10.



                       STAUFFENBERG
            STOP. WAIT UNTIL THEY COMMIT.

     The men calm when they see the Colonel, trusting him.
     They turn and watch the formation of planes complete
     their turn and bear down, gaining speed. Knees tense,
     some jerking from the natural inclination to flee.

                   STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
            STAND FAST, I SAID.

     They do, despite the menace of the planes' engines
     growing louder, meaner...


13   INT. LEAD FIGHTER COCKPIT - DAY                          13

     The confused PILOT takes in the mass of motionless
     men below. His finger tenses on the trigger and...


14   EXT. DESERT - DAY                                        14

                           STAUFFENBERG
            NOW.

     The mob of soldiers breaks - some right, some left -
     as the fighters open fire on what had been the center
     of their mass. Unable to change course quickly
     enough, they spray their lead into the sand.

     In that same instant, Stauffenberg drops into his
     seat, the Young Lieutenant jams the jeep in drive and
     a wave of hot lead misses them by mere feet.
     Stauffenberg watches his men regroup, waiting out the
     turning squadron. They've got the idea now. He turns
     to his Lieutenant who smiles admiringly. But
     Stauffenberg's eyes widen. He grabs his Lieutenant's
     head and jams it down, revealing a STRAY FIGHTER
     coming up from behind. Stauffenberg ducks out of
     frame, shielding the Young Lieutenant with his body.

     BANG. Blood sprays across the jeep's windshield
     before bullets rip it to pieces, leaving only clear
     blue African sky... And then the EXPLOSION.

     SILENCE. FADE TO WHITE.

     A fast clicking. Heels on linoleum. A beautiful,
     dignified woman keeps herself from running. She is:

     NINA VON STAUFFENBERG (30), Stauffenberg's wife and
     mother of his four children. Beside her is BERTHOLD
     VON STAUFFENBERG (38), Stauffenberg's older brother.

     They reach the door of a private hospital room just
     as A DOCTOR comes out. Awkward pause.

                           DOCTOR
            Mrs. Stauffenberg?

                            NINA
               (nodding, gesturing to Berthold)
            The Colonel's brother, Berthold.

                           DOCTOR
            Perhaps before you see the Colonel
            we should go to my office and-

                            NINA
            I will see my husband now.

     The Doctor wants to argue but Nina's eyes shut him
     down. He opens the door and they enter to find:


16   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                         16

     A mass of mummy-like bandages with only small
     openings around the mouth and one eye. The arms and
     hands are also wrapped in heavy dressing. No movement
     but for the rise and fall of the patient's chest.

     Berthold cannot look. Holding back her anguish, Nina
     bravely turns to the Doctor. "Well?"

                          DOCTOR
            He's been constant with fever but
            he refuses any pain killers. The
            right hand has been amputated above
            the wrist. He's lost the fourth and
            fifth fingers on the left. We...
            couldn't save the left eye.

     Berthold covers his face. Nina is a rock.

                             NINA
            His ring.

                            DOCTOR
            I don't-

                                                        12.



                            NINA
            He had a ring on his right hand.
            Where is it?

                           DOCTOR
            I'm sorry... His hand was amputated
            in the field... I'm afraid-

                             NINA
            Thank you.                                               

     As in: "That will be all." The Doctor leaves. Nina              
     sits beside her husband. She shows him a photo of
     FOUR BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN - three boys and a girl.

     Stauffenberg tries to speak but can't. His eye begins
     to tear.

     Nina removes a ring from her finger, placing it on a
     chain with a cross she takes from around her neck. It
     is identical to the ring Stauffenberg wore in Africa.

     CLOSE ON: The engraving inside the band - finis-
     initium [end-beginning]. Nina places the ring and
     chain on her husband's chest, her hand lingering. She
     cannot hold the tears back any longer. She stands and
     turns away, not wanting her husband to see.

     Berthold takes her place. Stauffenberg struggles to
     speak. Berthold puts an ear to the hole where
     Stauffenberg's mouth is - making out his question,
     even if we can't. Berthold debates answering, then:

                          BERTHOLD
            We've lost North Africa.

     CLOSE ON: That one eye staring at us closes.


17   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAYS LATER                          17

     Stauffenberg's bandages are gone - a black patch
     covering what had been his left eye. The chain with
     the cross and ring from Nina hangs around his neck.

     ANOTHER PATIENT lies motionless in the next bed.

     A man's belongings tell you more about him than he
     ever could. Stauffenberg's side of the room is neatly
     arranged, books of poetry and philosophy are well
     worn. Beside them are his own writings - the print
     meticulous and flowing. Up to a certain date. After
     that a new, child-like hand has taken over.

                                                   13.



A family photograph shows the Stauffenberg's of
another generation - wealthy aristocrats from a
bygone era. He is a teenager in this photo and
smiling broadly. A smile he left in Africa.

Stauffenberg's three fingers push a cotton ball under
his eyepatch to dab the empty socket. Then he goes to
button his shirt. Holding his collar in his teeth, he
tries to do the buttons with the use of only three
fingers on his left hand. It is heartbreaking to
watch.

He is about to give up when he notices a figure
looming in the doorway. General Olbricht. He winces
at the sight of Stauffenberg's deformities.

                  STAUFFENBERG
       I don't know what I ever did with
       ten.

Olbricht manages a smile, he moves to speak, but
Stauffenberg beats him to it.

              STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
       I'm wanted in Berlin.

Olbricht nods.

              STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
       Are you asking as a member of the
       High Command?

Olbricht contemplates his answer. He carefully closes
the door behind him, nervously glancing at the
patient in the next bed.

              STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
       You can speak openly, General. He
       died just before you came in.

Awkward moment. Finally:

                     OLBRICHT
       We could use your help.

                  STAUFFENBERG
       I'm a field officer.

Olbricht steps closer, speaking openly now.

                     OLBRICHT
       This war can't be won in the field.

                                                 14.



                   STAUFFENBERG
       That's unfortunate for me.                         

                     OLBRICHT
       You can't honestly believe you'll
       make a difference on the front-

                   STAUFFENBERG
       I'm a soldier, General. I serve my
       country.

                     OLBRICHT
       It makes no sense. You opposed
       Hitler, you opposed the war.

                   STAUFFENBERG
       The people chose otherwise and here
       we are. Now we have to win. You
       know what will happen if we don't.

                     OLBRICHT
       If we win, it will still be
       Hitler's Germany.

                   STAUFFENBERG
       We all took an oath, General.                      

Olbricht nods, resigning. He realizes it is no use.
Finally, he produces a blue velvet box, opening it to
reveal a brilliant gold medal.

                    OLBRICHT
       On behalf of the Führer.

Stauffenberg takes the medal and studies it.

                  STAUFFENBERG
       I'm a twin, you know.

Olbricht is as confused as we are.

                     OLBRICHT
       I... I didn't.

                  STAUFFENBERG
       My brother died the day after we
       were born.

                     OLBRICHT
       I'm sorry.

What the hell is he talking about?

                                                         15.



                        STAUFFENBERG
            I was lying in the desert, covered
            in blood, sure I was going to die.
            I tried to think about my wife, my
            children... But my mind kept
            drifting to my dead brother. How I
            would finally be with him. How I
            would finally be whole again...

     He snaps out of his thoughts, holding up his arm.

                   STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
            This is my reward for what happened
            to my men. It's all I deserve.

     Stauffenberg nonchalantly tosses the medal into a
     nearby bedpan.


18   INT. HOSPITAL - CRITICAL WARD - DAY                       18   

     CLOSE ON: A field of white. A three fingered hand             
     enters the frame, gently placing a medal identical to         
     the one just saw.                                             

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Stauffenberg, done up in his             
     finest dress uniform, placing said medal on an                
     unconscious WOUNDED SOLDIER.                                  

     AN AIDE stands behind him, carrying a silver tray             
     stacked with MANY BOXES containing such medals.               

     PULL BACK FURTHER TO REVEAL: Stauffenberg stands              
     between two long rows of beds, each with A WOUNDED            
     SOLDIER. Those that can respond to Stauffenberg do so         
     with reverence. The ward is eerily silent.                    

     With only three fingers, Stauffenberg cannot pin the          
     medals to his men. He has to settle for simply laying         
     them on a each soldier's chest or a pillow. With each         
     medal he presents, the task becomes harder to watch.          

     Suddenly, Stauffenberg freezes, finding himself               
     looking at THE YOUNG LIEUTENANT - his driver in               
     Africa. The young man is a mass of bandages, his legs         
     gone, his face smashed.                                       

     CLOSE ON: Stauffenberg's face - the reality of Africa         
     taking the wind out of him. Over this we hear a               
     familiar clicking of heels and:                               

                                                      16.




19   INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - LATER                         19

     Stauffenberg's boots pound the floor as he rushes for          
     the door, desperate to get out, barely able to                 
     breathe. At first he does not hear:

                        VOICE (O.S.)
            Colonel... COLONEL.

     A hand grabs his shoulder. Stauffenberg turns, ready
     to strike. He stops when he sees the Doctor holding a
     small, square box. Another sort medal perhaps?                 

                        STAUFFENBERG
            I don't want the damn th-                               

     The Doctor opens the box to reveal:                            

     A GLASS EYEBALL sitting atop a layer of satin,
     staring blankly back at Stauffenberg. Creepy.

                          DOCTOR
            When will you be going back to the
            front?

     Beat. Stauffenberg just stares back at the eyeball.

                        STAUFFENBERG
            I'm not going to the front. I'm
            needed in Berlin.


20   EXT. BERLIN - NIGHT                                     20

     The city sleeps. An unsettling image knowing that, in
     war, quiet can turn to chaos in the blink of an eye.


21   INT. TOWNHOUSE FOYER - NIGHT                            21

     Soft knocking at the front door is further muffled by
     heavy black-out curtains. A YOUNG OFFICER enters the
     frame, dousing the lights, parting the curtains and
     opening the door to reveal a SHADOWY FIGURE on the
     stoop.                                                         

     The figure steps into the half light to reveal his
     fresh scars and eye-patch. And from the dark quiet of          
     the foyer we CUT TO:

                                                       17.




22   INT. SMOKY ROOM - NIGHT                                 22

     Chaos. The air is thick with cigar smoke and harsh
     words. A DOZEN MEN - some officers, some civilians -
     are fighting bitterly, everyone talking at once.
     Stauffenberg enters unnoticed, escorted in by the
     YOUNG OFFICER who immediately ducks out again.

     Stauffenberg scans the faces in the room. We
     recognize Olbricht and Tresckow. With them we find...

     A distinguished gentleman in his early sixties:

     TITLES: ERWIN VON WITZLEBEN - FORMER FIELD MARSHAL OF
     THE MILITARY DISTRICT. FORCED OUT BY HITLER, 1938.

     Beside him is a rough-hewn, charismatic man despite
     his 59 years. A face millions might follow. He is:

     TITLES: DR. CARL GOERDELER - FORMER MAYOR OF LEIPZIG.
     RESIGNED IN PROTEST, 1937.

     And finally, a grandfatherly sort with surprisingly
     kind eyes, sitting outside the fight - tired and
     saddened by it.                                                

     TITLES: LUDWIG BECK - FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF FOR THE
     GERMAN ARMY. RESIGNED IN PROTEST, 1938.

                         WITZLEBEN
            ...He is not a man, he's a lunatic.
            He doesn't drink, he doesn't fuck.
            He has no weakness to exploit, no
            vice to manipulate. His only                            
            passion is complete control. How
            can you expect to reason with him?

                         GOERDELER
            After this most recent failure I'd
            say we've no other choice.

                         WITZLEBEN
            Confront Hitler now and you'll end
            up with piano wire for a neck-tie.
            Our only option is the central
            solution.                                               

                         GOERDELER
            He's a man like any other. Flesh
            and blood. Take him head on and-

                                                   18.



                    TRESCKOW
       I'll say this for you, Doctor...
       You're certainly delusional enough
       to take Hitler's place.

                    GOERDELER
                  (eyes narrowing)
       When that day comes, I'll be sure
       to remember you.

                     TRESCKOW
       I doubt you'll remember much of
       anything.

                    GOERDELER
       Dammit, Tresckow-

And the shouting resumes. It is Beck who finally sees
Stauffenberg. He touches Tresckow's arm. He, in turn,
nudges Olbricht and so on. A moment later, the room
is silent, all eyes on the Colonel. Everyone is a
little embarrassed. Olbricht clears his throat:

                     OLBRICHT
       Gentlemen, may I present Colonel
       Stauffenberg. He's been reassigned
       to my office at the War Ministry.
                  (to Stauffenberg)
       Colonel, may I introduce-

                   STAUFFENBERG
       These men need no introduction.

Beck stands, shaking Stauffenberg's hand.                  

                       BECK
       I apologize for this unfortunate...
       spectacle. On behalf of everyone,
       welc-

But before he can finish, Beck is seized with a
gravelly cough that sends an uncomfortable chill
through the room. He is very ill.                          

                     GOERDELER
                   (to the others)
       I haven't welcomed him. Not yet.
       Where does he stand?

                     TRESCKOW
       For God's sake-

                                                 19.



                    GOERDELER
                 (re: Stauffenberg)
       He's a field officer. He knows the
       army better than any of us. I want
       to hear his opinion.

                     TRESCKOW                            
                  (to Stauffenberg)
       All right. What do you think,                     
       Colonel? Confront Hitler, force him               
       to resign? Or the central solution?               

But before Stauffenberg can answer:                      

                    GOERDELER                            
       "Central Solution." You soldiers                  
       are all the same. Say what you                    
       mean.                                             

                    WITZLEBEN                            
       That's a laugh coming from a                      
       politician.                                       

                    GOERDELER                            
       The army will follow diplomats                    
       before they follow assassins.

                     TRESCKOW                            
       They follow a butcher now. What
       difference does it-                               

                   STAUFFENBERG
       What makes you think the army will                
       follow you at all?                                

The room quiets down. Beck hides a slight smile. He      
likes Stauffenberg already.                              

              STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)                      
       Oust him, kill him. That isn't what               
       matters. How do you plan to take                  
       control of the government when                    
       Hitler is gone?                                   

Silence. Then a wave of laughter. "The balls on this     
guy."                                                    

                    GOERDELER                            
       I beg your pardon, Colonel, but you               
       are in the presence of men who                    
       would have been Hitler's inner                    
       circle. Instead we resigned. We put               
       our principles above personal gain.               

                                                        20.



                         WITZLEBEN                                   
            We have the have the respect of the                      
            people. And the army.                                    

                        STAUFFENBERG
            With all respect, sir, you put too
            much faith in your popularity.
                    (to Goerdeler, pointed)
            All of you do.

                         GOERDELER
            Now see here, Colonel-

                       STAUFFENBERG
            You said yourself, I'm a field                           
            officer. You all may understand                          
            government, but I know the men. A                        
            great many of them may hate Hitler,                      
            but they all fear him - they fear                        
            Himmler, Goebbels, the whole of the                      
            Reich. That kind of fear won't just                      
            die with Hitler. And as for                              
            respect: the army, and the people,                       
            respect only one thing. Authority.                       
            And if just one man questions that                       
            authority, you can lose them all.                        
                      (to Beck, pointed)                             
            They were fooled into following                          
            Hitler... How will you fool them -                       
            force them - into following you?                         

     Pause. The conspirators look at one another again,
     unsure of how to answer. For Stauffenberg it is a
     dreadful revelation.


23   EXT. BERLIN - STREET - NIGHT                             23

     A depressed Stauffenberg walks down the deserted
     night streets. Silent but for the echo of his
     footsteps. Eerie.

     Across the street, an OLD WOMAN peers nervously out
     her window. The instant Stauffenberg makes eye
     contact she steps back, drawing the curtains. Afraid.

     He approaches a cozy brick cottage - the Berlin home
     he shares with his brother, Berthold. He is surprised
     when he looks through the window to find FOUR
     CHILDREN laughing and playing - the sound of music on
     a phonograph. Bittersweet.

                                                         21.



     In the next house over, he catches sight of a TEENAGE
     BOY, the picture of Aryan youth, watching him
     suspiciously from the upstairs window. It seems
     everyone is watching everyone in Hitler's German.


24   INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - NIGHT                            24

     Stauffenberg comes through the front door, the sound
     of the phonograph blaring now. Meet the children:
     BERTHOLD (9), HEIMERAN (7), FRANZ (5), VALERIE (2).

     They chase one another around the house in their
     pajamas making such a racket that the phonograph
     skips. (It will do so throughout the scene.) The
     children see Stauffenberg and charge, screaming:

                           CHILDREN
            PAPA.

     He scoops them up, one by one, and kisses them,
     instantly putting the day's events behind him.
     Berthold follows them into the room, smiling.

                        STAUFFENBERG
                         (to children)
            What are you doing here? I thought
            I left you in Bamberg.
                         (to Berthold)
            It's a wonderful surprise. Thank
            you, brother.

                          CHILDREN
            MAMA, COME DOWN. PAPA IS HERE. PAPA
            IS HERE. (Etc.)


25   INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - BEDROOM - NIGHT                  25

     Nina nervously fixes her hair in the mirror. LOOK
     DOWN TO REVEAL a small datebook with a smaller
     monthly calendar in the corner of the page. A red dot
     marks one date in particular, followed by black dots
     for each day that has passed since. She turns
     sideways, smoothing her dress over her belly. In
     every way she indicates to us that she is pregnant.

     She tucks the datebook under some sundries in her
     luggage and rushes down to greet her husband.

     We stay in the room, hearing her greet Stauffenberg
     O.S. Laughter at children's antics we cannot see. The
     phonograph skips. More laughter.

                                                        22.


     We want to go see them in their happiness. Instead we
     linger on Stauffenberg's dresser - neat and orderly.
     We focus on a photograph of the family from happier
     times.

     Beside it is a small box containing a glass eye.                


26   INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT             26

     Stauffenberg and Nina dance with one another to the
     delight of the children. We gradually PUSH IN tight
     on their faces, watching an entire conversation take
     place without dialogue. Each has a secret the other
     can guess. Stauffenberg looks at Nina, then her
     belly, first realizing and then questioning. Nina
     smiles and nods. Stauffenberg hugs her, delighted,
     but his delight is tainted with worry.

     Then the tables turn. Nina looks at Stauffenberg, as
     if divining his secret. His face never changes - a
     statue with that same tainted smile. In her face we
     see slow, grim realization. She may not know exactly
     what is going on, but she knows it is something. She
     does her best to keep smiling for the children. After
     the longest of moments, she nods. "All right." Then
     she puts her head on his shoulder, hiding her fears.

     It is an important moment. Read it again, taking the
     time to picture it in your mind. Then leave it alone.
     Done right it's a beautiful scene about a man, his
     family and the fate of the world.


27   INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT             27

     Nina reads a story to the children in the adjoining
     room - an idyllic scene. The sound of the phonograph
     is soft and constant.

     Stauffenberg picks at a late dinner, now adept at the
     use of only three fingers. Berthold sits across from
     him, deeply troubled by whatever conversation we have
     just missed. They speak in hushed tones.

                          BERTHOLD
            What do you mean you quit?

                       STAUFFENBERG
            I came to join the Resistance, not
            some sewing circle of discarded
            generals and politicians.

                                                 23.



                     BERTHOLD
       Beck is a just and capable man. As
       for Goerdeler, well, he's popular.
       He'll make a good Chancellor.

                   STAUFFENBERG
       Like Hitler before him, yes? Lately
       I have to wonder if Germany is even
       fit to choose her own destiny.

                    BERTHOLD
       You can't blame the people for
       this. You have to see the beginning
       of something to know how it'll end.
       It's no different than a farmer
       watching the corn grow. One day
       it's over his head.

                   STAUFFENBERG
       Plenty of people thought-

                     BERTHOLD
       The greatest offenders are not the
       ones who thought better but the
       ones who sensed better.

                  STAUFFENBERG
       What are you trying to say?

                    BERTHOLD
       I seem to remember you telling me
       about reports from the Ukraine -
       the SS forcing Jews to dig their
       own graves. You said then that
       Hitler should be removed. An
       officer's duty, you said. What's
       changed?

                   STAUFFENBERG
       I said senior officers. The only
       men that can get to him.                           

                    BERTHOLD
       Perhaps it doesn't matter that you
       succeed.

Stauffenberg looks at Berthold like he is crazy, but:

                BERTHOLD (CONT'D)
       Perhaps it only matters that you
       try. Don't you see? Someone has to
       stand up and show the world that
       not all of us were like him.

                                                       24.



                       STAUFFENBERG
            Even if they could remove Hitler,
            they can't hope to seize power. For
            God's sake, they have no plan.

                          BERTHOLD
            Then give them one. Find a way.

     He puts a hand on Stauffenberg's arm.

                     BERTHOLD (CONT'D)
            Evil happens when good men do
            nothing.

     Before Stauffenberg can answer, new music comes
     blasting from the phonograph O.S. The unmistakable
     sound of Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries.

                       STAUFFENBERG
            Children, that is far too-

     He is cut off by the appearance of his four children,
     all wearing cloaks made of bed sheets, pots for
     helmets and brandishing makeshift swords. They charge
     into the room, singing loudly and attacking their
     father. He does his best to defend himself with one
     hand. Their commotion causes the phonograph to skip.

     And you'd think that's where it ends. We even pull
     back, creating that effect. It takes a moment to
     notice the wailing sound we're suddenly hearing is
     not on the phonograph. Nina hears it first, then
     Stauffenberg and Berthold. Finally the children
     freeze and the phonograph skips without their help.
     The glasses on the table rattle.

     Now we hear the wailing quite clearly. A siren.

                   STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
            Air-raid.

     The adults herd the children out of the room. Muffled
     concussions cause the phonograph to skip frequently,
     turning Wagner's masterpiece into a stutter.


28   INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - BASEMENT - NIGHT               28

     The family rushes down the stairs, huddling in a
     corner - adults holding shivering children. The bombs
     are closer, louder. The Wagner, the siren, the
     explosions fray the nerves.

                                                       25.


     Stauffenberg reaches for Nina in the darkness,
     finding her belly. Her hand clamps around his -
     around their unborn child.

     BOOM. So close the children scream. Dust and debris
     fall from the ceiling. The needle rakes the
     phonograph upstairs going back to the beginning.

     CLOSE ON STAUFFENBERG - on his eye. His thoughts as
     the bombs fall all around his home - a moment of
     profound realization...


29   INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT            29

     Move across the room to the phonograph, looking down
     at the 78 spinning on the turntable. The camera
     begins to turn until all the world around us is
     spinning and only the record is still. We read one
     word of the title of the 78 quite clearly:

                    STAUFFENBERG (V.O.)                             
            Valkyrie.


30   INT. SMOKY ROOM - NIGHT                                 30

     Stauffenberg faces the top members of the Resistance.

                          OLBRICHT
            We've already considered Valkyrie.
            It isn't suitable.

                        STAUFFENBERG
            Not as it's currently written.

                         GOERDELER
            Excuse me. What is Valkyrie?

                          TRESCKOW
            Operation Valkyrie.

     Tresckow explains even as he studies Stauffenberg,
     curious. What does he have in mind?

                     TRESCKOW (CONT'D)
            The Reserve Army has thousands of                       
            men all over the city - most of                         
            them not even in uniform. Valkyrie                      
            is top secret plan to mobilize                          
            those men in a national emergency.                      

                                              26.



                   STAUFFENBERG                       
       Hitler designed it himself to crush
       any internal unrest if he's cut off
       or killed.

                    GOERDELER
       And what use is that to us?

                   STAUFFENBERG
       The orders could be rewritten. A               
       few subtle changes would put those             
       reserve units completely under our             
       command.

                     OLBRICHT
       Yes, of course, but-

                   STAUFFENBERG
       Now what would the High Command do
       if they thought, say, the SS was
       staging a coup?

                     OLBRICHT
       They would declare a military state
       of emergency.

                     TRESCKOW
       And initiate Operation Valkyrie.

                     STAUFFENBERG
       Hitler's   own Reserve Army, using
       Hitler's   own plan and under our
       command,   would automatically seize
       power in   Berlin...                           

                     GOERDELER                        
                    (catching on)                     
       While we put a new government in               
       place.

                   STAUFFENBERG
       Precisely. It will seem as though
       we're fighting for Hitler                      
       Government, not against it.                    

                    GOERDELER
       But only if Hitler's dead.                     

All eyes turn to Goerdeler. Here we go.

                GOERDELER (CONT'D)
       That is what you're saying, isn't
       it? The central solution.

                                                 27.

                GOERDELER (CONT'D)
       How else will you make people
       believe the SS is trying to seize
       power?

                   STAUFFENBERG
       I'm afraid it's the only way.

                    GOERDELER
       I'm disappointed in you, Colonel. I
       thought a man of your background
       would appreciate a more-

                   STAUFFENBERG
       I'm a soldier first, an aristocrat
       second.

                       GOERDELER
       Yes, but-

                   STAUFFENBERG
       And you're neither, Doctor. Now if
       you want to be Chancellor, you'll
       do as you're told.

A moment of tension. Humiliated, Goerdeler nods. But
he won't ever forget this...

                       BECK
                    (to Tresckow)
       Can this plan be made to work?

                     TRESCKOW
       Rewriting the order is one thing -
       distributing it is another. A bomb
       can be disarmed, recovered if it
       fails. In this case we'd be
       willfully circulating written
       evidence of high treason.
                      (thinks)
       It's the best idea we've heard yet.

                     OLBRICHT
       There is one... small problem.

                       TRESCKOW
                       (realizing)
       Fromm...

                       GOERDELER
       Who is Fromm?

                                                         28.



                          TRESCKOW
            Commander of the Home Army.
            Olbricht can put the reserve troops
            on alert, but only Fromm can
            actually initiate Valkyrie.

                            BECK
            Can we get to him?

                          OLBRICHT
            He's a careerist pig.

                        STAUFFENBERG
            But one who's gone as high as he
            can go in Hitler's Army. It's no
            secret he's not happy about it.

                          TRESCKOW
            Perhaps if we offered him a key
            position in the new regime he could
            be made to see the light.

                            BECK
            We don't seem to have a choice.
            Without Fromm there is no Valkyrie.
                (to Olbricht and Stauffenberg)
            Get him.

     We end on Goerdeler, a look of concern on his face.


31   INT. WAR MINISTRY - WAITING ROOM - DAY                    31

     TITLES: REICH WAR MINISTRY - OFFICE OF GENERAL
     FRIEDRICH FROMM.

     MUTED SHOUTS from O.S. Someone is getting reamed.
     Fromm's adjutant, LIEUTENANT FRANZ HERBER - a young,
     dedicated soldier - sits at his desk, trying to
     ignore the screaming from the other room in between
     stolen glances at...

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Stauffenberg and Olbricht
     waiting patiently, sitting across from:

     MAJOR JOHN VON FREYEND, a dutiful Nazi whose face we
     immediately don't like. He smiles coldly, taking
     pleasure in the shouting O.S. He stares at
     Stauffenberg, studying him, making us nervous.

     Fromm's door finally opens and A BIGGER THAN LIFE
     NAZI storms out.

                                                         29.



     TITLES: FIELD MARSHAL WILHELM KEITEL - HITLER'S CHIEF
     OF STAFF.

     Freyend stands, holding Keitel's hat and coat for
     him. A perfect toady.

                           KEITEL
            You're a woman, Fromm. And a fat
            one at that. I'd have you sent to
            the front if I didn't think you'd
            surrender just to be Montgomery's
            whore.

     Keitel storms out, leaving a pall. Freyend gives
     Stauffenberg a last once-over and follows. Beat:

                           HERBER
            The... General will see you now.


32   INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS           32

     Stauffenberg and Olbricht step inside to find:

     TITLES: GENERAL FRIEDRICH FROMM - COMMANDER OF THE
     GERMAN RESERVE ARMY.

     The haggard Fromm sits at his desk, rubbing his
     temples. Stauffenberg and Olbricht share a confident
     look. Surely this guy hates the High Command. Without
     looking up to see them:

                           FROMM
            What is it you want?

     Olbricht hesitates. Fromm looks up.

                       FROMM (CONT'D)
            Well, Olbricht? Speak up.

                          OLBRICHT
            I wanted to introduce you to our
            new man - Colonel Stauffenberg.

                           FROMM
            Ah yes - the hero from Africa. I'd
            offer my hand but you might not
            give it back.

                        STAUFFENBERG
            I'd say the General's lost more
            important things this morning.

                                                 30.



Freeze. But after a tense beat, Fromm relaxes and         
laughs, taking a cigarette from a box on his desk and
nudging it toward them.

                       FROMM
       About time they put a man with
       balls in this office. Have a seat.
                    (to Olbricht)
       You too, if you must.

They sit. Fromm lights a cigarette, leans back and
exhales a cloud of smoke. We let things sit for
awhile. The game of recruitment is about to begin and
no one is sure where to start. The longer the quiet,
the more awkward things seem. Finally:

                  FROMM (CONT'D)
       They tell me you're critical of the
       war, Colonel. Not that you don't
       seem to have good reason.

                   STAUFFENBERG
       I am critical of losing the war,
       General. All wars - as in Africa -
       are lost through indecision.

                      FROMM
       In the field, you mean.

He's baiting Stauffenberg to talk shit about Hitler.

                    STAUFFENBERG
       In Berlin.

                      FROMM
       I take it that's why you're here.
       To make decisions.

                   STAUFFENBERG
       I've made my decision, General. I`m
       here to help others make theirs.

Stauffenberg makes no attempt to shade his delivery.
He is quite clearly indicating that he means more.
Fromm knows it, but he's being coy.

                      FROMM
       They say when there's no clear
       option, one should do nothing.

                   STAUFFENBERG
       We're at war. We must act.                         
       Sometimes... rashly.

                                                 31.



                      FROMM
       Just what sort of rash action did
       you have in mind, Colonel?

                   STAUFFENBERG
       That would be a decision for the
       Supreme Military Commander.

Fromm is getting the message. He takes a deep drag.

                      FROMM
       Supreme Commander, you say.

                   STAUFFENBERG
       Second only to the Chancellor.

                      FROMM
       If only I were that man... This war
       would be going quite differently.

                     OLBRICHT
       We were thinking the very same
       thing.

Fromm frowns at Olbricht. This was a bit too obvious.
Stauffenberg shoots Olbricht a look. "What the hell
are you doing?"

Fromm casually stamps out his cigarette in the
ashtray and picks up the telephone.

Olbricht and Stauffenberg steel their nerves -
certain they are going to be reported. But Fromm
doesn't dial. Instead, to our relief, he disconnects
the line. When he is certain that it is dead:

                      FROMM
       I don't need to remind you that
       we've all sworn an oath. That said,
       I'm going to forget we had this
       conversation with the understanding
       that such speak will never occur
       under this roof again. Am I clear?

              STAUFFENBERG/OLBRICHT
       Yes, sir.

                        FROMM
       Tell   your friends that I always
       come   down on the right side. And as
       long   as the Führer is alive, you
       know   what side that is.

                                                         32.

                       FROMM (CONT'D)
                      (raising his hand)
            Heil Hitler.


33   INT. WAR MINISTRY - CORRIDOR- CONTINUOUS                  33   

                          OLBRICHT                                    
                     (trying to be upbeat)                            
            I think that went rather well.                            

                        STAUFFENBERG                                  
            Yes... Quite.                                             


34   EXT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - DAY                              34

     A car loaded with luggage. Stauffenberg hugs his                 
     children, one by one, before placing them inside.                

     Then he turns to face Nina. As always, there is much             
     to be said that they cannot say. She gently touches
     the silver chain around his neck, the ring and the
     cross she gave him. They embrace tightly and kiss.
     She gets in the car, looking at him through the back
     window as she is driven away.                                    


35   EXT. FOREST - NIGHT                                       35

     Darkness. As our eyes adjust we realize we are in the
     middle of the woods. Is this a dream? A nightmare? We
     are drawn toward a flickering light in the distance.


36   EXT. FOREST - CLEARING - NIGHT                            36

     From out of the darkness comes a candle held by a
     nervous, almost mousy young woman, FRAULEIN VON OVEN.
     Walking just behind her is Tresckow. He carries a
     small but heavy case in one hand.

     They come to a clearing in the woods and find a
     strange sight. In the center is a tree stump
     surrounded by papers, including the original orders
     for OPERATION VALKYRIE, next to a leather valise
     marked with the seal of the Reich. The orders have
     been meticulously annotated.

                        VOICE (O.S.)
            Were you followed?

                                                         33.



     Fraulein Oven gasps. Tresckow turns, pistol drawn.
     The tip of his barrel comes up just inches from
     Stauffenberg's eyepatch. Stauffenberg smiles,
     emerging from the shadows.

                          TRESCKOW
            Dammit, Stauffenberg. You scared me
            half to death.

                        STAUFFENBERG
            We'll be closer than that before
            we're finished.


37   EXT. FOREST - LATER                                       37

     Wearing white gloves, Fraulein Oven opens the case
     Tresckow brought, revealing a portable typewriter.
     She carefully feeds a sheet of crisp parchment into
     the machine and sets the margins carefully. Pause.
     Then she starts typing with remarkable speed.

     (Note: The sound of typing runs throughout the scene,
     punctuated by the crack of the carriage return - each
     time a little louder.)

     Stauffenberg and Tresckow carefully pore over the
     Valkyrie orders, scribbling copious notes.

                          TRESCKOW
            Looking this over, I'm not
            satisfied that the Reserve Army is
            enough to shut down Berlin
            completely.

                        STAUFFENBERG
                     (handing over papers)
            Yes, I've been giving that some
            thought. We should include any
            field units that are home on leave.

     Before Tresckow can respond, more papers:

                   STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
            I've also drawn up an outline for
            orders to streamline combat groups
            in order to quietly concentrate
            forces at vital points - state and
            government buildings, of course,
            but also the radio and newspapers.

     More papers. Tresckow can barely keep up.

                                                         34.



                      STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
               Combat groups will be reorganized
               as reinforced grenadier regiments.
               One or two of them can be quickly
               mobilized, eliminating the usual
               six hour lag. We blitz the
               government quarter, arrest all
               Ministers and Party leaders,
               surround all SS and police
               barracks. Any officers who resist
               will be arrested... or shot.

     CRACK. A carriage return as loud as a rifle-shot.             


38   EXT. BERLIN - STREET - LATER                              38   

     A truck full of soldiers roars past. Stauffenberg,            
     Tresckow and Fraulein Oven walk across a dimly lit            
     bridge on a foggy night in Berlin, stopping in the            
     middle.                                                       

     Stauffenberg carries a leather valise with the                
     Valkyrie orders, Tresckow carries the typewriter              
     case. They stop at the center of the bridge, looking          
     around carefully. No one is in sight, but anyone              
     could be watching from the shadows. Eerie.                    

                           STAUFFENBERG                            
                          (to the Fraulein)                        
               If anyone comes to you, play                        
               ignorant. Just tell them-                           

                          FRAULEIN OVEN                            
               I'll tell that I was serving the                    
               German people. Then I'll tell them                  
               to go to hell.                                      

     Both men smile, a bit taken aback. Von Oven shakes            
     each man's hand and walks away, swallowed up by the           
     darkness. When she is gone:                                   

                            TRESCKOW                               
               To Operation Valkyrie.                              

     Stauffenberg nods. Tresckow heaves the typewriter             
     case over the railing and into the water below.               

     SPLASH.                                                       

     They watch in silence as the water settles, then:             

                                                 35.



                TRESCKOW (CONT'D)                         
       I've been transferred to the front.                

                   STAUFFENBERG                           
                      (shocked)                           
       Why didn't you tell me?                            

                     TRESCKOW                             
       Would you have stayed?                             

Obviously not. Then it occurs to Stauffenberg.            

                   STAUFFENBERG                           
       Do you think Fromm reported us?                    

                     TRESCKOW                             
       It's more likely just... an                        
       unfortunate coincidence. Anyway it                 
       doesn't matter. You wrote the                      
       orders. You know them better than                  
       anyone.                                            

                   STAUFFENBERG                           
       You don't mean to say-                             

                     TRESCKOW                             
       I'm appointing you military leader                 
       of the Resistance. Beck agrees.                    

                   STAUFFENBERG                           
       But Olbricht-                                      

                     TRESCKOW                             
       We both know Olbricht hasn't the                   
       wit or the spine. No. It's you.                    

A million thoughts are running through Stauffenberg's     
mind. Fear. Anxiety. But he knows what he must do.        

                TRESCKOW (CONT'D)                         
       One more thing. You were right what                
       you said that first night. It's not                
       enough to kill Hitler. We need to                  
       isolate his chain of command. The                  
       slightest confusion could crush us.                
       We need to be certain that no                      
       conflicting orders get out after                   
       the flash.                                         

Stauffenberg considers this for a moment.                 

                                                      36.



                        STAUFFENBERG                                
            That greatly limits our options of                      
            where and when to make our move,                        
            but it's the only way.                                  

                          TRESCKOW                                  
            How will you do it?                                     

                        STAUFFENBERG                                
            Perhaps it's better I don't say.                        

     Pause. A sad smile and nod from Tresckow, a moment             
     ago he was in charge. Now he has no clearance.                 

                         TRESCKOW                                   
            God promised Abraham that he would                      
            not destroy Sodom if he could find                      
            just ten righteous men.                                 

     He puts a hand on Stauffenberg's shoulder.                     

                     TRESCKOW (CONT'D)                              
            I have a feeling that for Germany                       
            it may come down to one.                                


39   INT. OFFICERS' CLUB - BERLIN - NIGHT                    39

     A wild party - a small band, German officers, plenty
     of women.

     In stark contrast, two GESTAPO MEN sip coffee at a
     corner table, keeping a watchful eye on the crowd.

     A WAITER carries a tray of drinks to a rowdy group in
     the corner who are immersed in the denial common to
     Berlin these days. The Waiter serves carefully,
     making sure one particular drink goes to:

     TITLES: GENERAL ERICH FELLGIEBEL - CHIEF OF THE ARMY
     SIGNAL CORPS.

     The group toasts and downs their booze.

     CLOSE ON: Fellgiebel's smile suddenly fades. He looks
     into his glass, his good mood vanishing. He politely
     excuses himself over the noise of the rowdy mob and
     heads for the bathroom. He looks ill.

                                                         37.




40   INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT                                     40

     Fellgiebel walks to the sink and dumps what is left
     of his drink in the basin.

     CLOSE ON: Mingling among the melting chunks of ice is
     a GLASS EYE staring back at him.

     He scowls in the mirror at Stauffenberg, waiting.

                         FELLGIEBEL
            You realize how close I am to
            Hitler. With one word I could have
            the Gestapo make you disappear.

                        STAUFFENBERG
            Why haven't you then?

     Fellgiebel checks the stalls to make sure they are
     empty. Stauffenberg collects his glass eye from the
     sink, dabbing it dry on a hand towel.

                   STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
            None of my associates know we've
            been talking if that's what you're
            afraid of.

                         FELLGIEBEL
            But you know. And when the SS catch
            you, they'll pull you apart like
            warm bread. It'll be a crime just
            to have known you then. I warn you.
            If it means protecting myself, I
            will expose you. Do not try to
            contact me again.

     Fellgiebel heads for the door but stops on:

                        STAUFFENBERG
            You can't report me. Maybe if you
            had when I first approached you,
            you'd have been keeping your oath.
            But now you're just as guilty as-

                         FELLGIEBEL
            So you think that makes me a
            sympathizer, eh? You give a man the
            choice of betraying a fellow
            officer or his Führer and assume
            his actions will show you his
            heart. It's not that simple.

                                                 38.



                   STAUFFENBERG
       It is to me.

                    FELLGIEBEL
       For the last time, don't push me to
       make a decision.

                   STAUFFENBERG
       I have no choice. It's clear now
       that without you we have no hope of
       success.

Pause. Fellgiebel's silence speaks volumes.

              STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
       You want us to succeed. Don't you?

                    FELLGIEBEL
       And what if you do, eh? What then?
       Will you be any different from
       Hitler? What of his Reich, his
       people, the very momentum of
       history? Will all of that let you
       be something he isn't?

                   STAUFFENBERG
       No.

                      FELLGIEBEL
       There it is.

                   STAUFFENBERG
       But my pregnant wife, our four
       children, the Germany I first swore
       to defend... They demand that I be
       something different. They demand
       that I fight for their future even
       if it means...

And for a moment his voice breaks and he chokes back
what may be tears.

              STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
       Even if it means that I never see
       them again.

In that moment we see a side of Stauffenberg we were
starting to doubt existed. We see his humanity. This
puts Fellgiebel in his place. He adjusts his tie and
we see the wedding ring on his finger.

                                                         39.



                   STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
            Action is inevitable. As are the
            consequences. When they come for me
            I'll do what I can to hide what you
            knew and when you knew it.
                     (stepping closer now)
            But don't delude yourself. You were
            involved in a crime against your
            country long before you met me.
            There's still time to redeem
            yourself. Only God can judge you
            now.

     BANG. The door bursts open, startling them both. But
     it is only a DRUNKEN OFFICER and a YOUNG WOMAN
     looking for some privacy.

                      DRUNKEN OFFICER
            Are you two finished or just
            getting started?

     The woman laughs. Stauffenberg walks out past them,
     leaving Fellgiebel with Hitler's finest.


41   INT. WAR MINISTRY - STAUFFENBERG'S OFFICE - DAY           41   

     What first catches our eye is the enormous portrait
     of Hitler looming over Stauffenberg's desk.

     Stauffenberg sits before a mountain of paperwork,
     surrounded on all sides by a flurry of SECRETARIES
     and AIDES. He looks up to find:                               

     Olbricht hovering in the doorway with that look that          
     says, "We need to talk." Stauffenberg clearly doesn't
     have the time. He sighs.

                       STAUFFENBERG                                
            Leave us, please.

     The staff instantly exits - a well-oiled machine.
     Stauffenberg unplugs the phone.

                          OLBRICHT
            You play the part of bureaucrat
            beautifully.

                        STAUFFENBERG
            It's the only time I can relax.

                                                 40.



                     OLBRICHT
       There's a man here to interview as
       your adjutant.

                   STAUFFENBERG
       Adjut- What for?

                     OLBRICHT
       No one told you?
                   (obviously not)
       You've been promoted Chief of Staff
       for the Reserve Army.

Some men might find a promotion to be good news. Not
Stauffenberg.

                  STAUFFENBERG
       For Christ's sake. Don't I have
       enough to do?

                     OLBRICHT
       Unfortunately, your nocturnal
       activities don't count as service
       to the Reich.

                   STAUFFENBERG
       I'll refuse the promotion.

                     OLBRICHT
       You'll do no such thing.

                   STAUFFENBERG
       Dammit, I can't handle the work I
       already-

                     OLBRICHT
       This is an opportunity we could
       never have dreamed of. You're in
       the inner circle now - with genuine
       access to Hitler, his advisors, his
       schedule... We need this.

                   STAUFFENBERG
       We're not ready. We're moving too
       fast.

                     OLBRICHT
       Not half as fast as the Allies. An
       invasion is coming, Colonel. Any
       day now. We must act and we must
       act soon.

                                                    41.

                OLBRICHT (CONT'D)
       Tresckow may have left you in
       charge of the "central solution,"                    
       but in this world I still outrank
       you. You will accept the
       appointment. Is that understood?

Stauffenberg nods, grudgingly.

                OLBRICHT (CONT'D)
       Now. The new man is waiting
       outside. He comes highly
       recommended. He might even be an
       ideal candidate.

                    STAUFFENBERG
       For what?

                     OLBRICHT
                      (smiling)                             
       We still need an assassin.

Olbricht leaves. Stauffenberg lets this sink in. He
takes a seat and goes back to work. After a moment:

A HANDSOME SOLDIER (36) quietly enters.                     

TITLES: LIEUTENANT WERNER VON HAEFTEN - RESERVIST.
WOUNDED DURING THE RUSSIAN CAMPAIGN.

Haeften clicks his heels and offers the Nazi salute,
but before he can say the words:

                    STAUFFENBERG
       Be seated.

Thrown, Haeften sits. Stauffenberg continues writing,
ignoring him. Haeften looks up at the portrait of
Hitler, startled when Stauffenberg finally speaks:

              STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
       Do you know how this war will end,
       Haeften? The portrait will be un-
       hung... And the man will be hung.

Stauffenberg looks up - looking for a reaction to
such frank and treasonous talk. He gets none. He
sighs, too tired to play games.

              STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
       Bottom line. I'm engaged in high
       treason with all means available to
       me. Can I count you in?

                                                       42.



     And the strangest thing - a reaction no one would
     suspect - Haeften relaxes, almost sighs, like someone
     who has at long last found a home.

                          HAEFTEN
            For anything, sir. Anything at all.

                        STAUFFENBERG
            Anything is a very dangerous word.


42   EXT. NORMANDY - VARIOUS - DAY/NIGHT                     42

     TITLES: 6 JUNE 1944.

     NEWSREEL FOOTAGE OF D-DAY. Allied forces invade
     Normandy. The liberation of Europe has begun.

     But this is not the D-Day you learned about in
     history class. This is a German newsreel. Nazi spin.
     In it, Hitler's forces have nothing to fear.

                      NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                          (subtitles)
            The Allied Forces have blundered
            into the trap awaiting them on the
            beaches of Normandy - heroically
            repelled by the combined might of
            the German Army. It is a glorious
            day for the Reich. At long last the
            craven enemy has come to Europe to
            face their inevitable defeat at the
            hands of-


43   INT. MILITARY SEDAN - NIGHT                             43

                           HAEFTEN
            Five thousand ships, one-hundred
            thousand men from the combined
            Allied forces.

     Haeften and Stauffenberg ride in a sedan.                      
     Stauffenberg is in profile the entire time.

                        STAUFFENBERG
            What about the Panzer divisions in-

                          HAEFTEN
            They were never dispatched. Word is
            Hitler took a sleeping pill. His
            staff was afraid to wake him.

                                                      43.



                        STAUFFENBERG
            First Africa, now France.

                          HAEFTEN
            The Russians bearing down from the
            East.

                        STAUFFENBERG
            Sometimes I wonder if Hitler's real
            aim is to leave nothing but
            scorched earth for all of Europe.

     Stauffenberg rubs his forehead. The car stops.                  
     SOLDIERS are waiting outside.

     Stauffenberg gets out of the car wearing an ornate
     dress uniform and carrying a leather valise. He has
     arrived at a meeting of great importance.

     He turns to face Haeften directly and we are
     surprised to see both of his eyes - for an instant
     the young lion he once was. But a closer look is
     unsettling - we see the faint scarring, one eye
     glowing and alive, the other cloudy and dead.

     His glass eye. Stauffenberg only wore it on special
     occasions. This is one.

                          HAEFTEN
            Maybe this is a blessing in
            disguise. Maybe he'll finally
            listen to reason - consider a truce
            while he still can.

                        STAUFFENBERG
            We'll see if I can't convince him.


44   EXT. THE BERGHOF - NIGHT                                 44

     Est. Hitler's forboding southern headquarters.

     TITLES: THE BERGHOF. 7 JUNE 1944.

     Stauffenberg walks up a flight of wide marble stairs -
     at the top he sees a group of WAITING ADJUTANTS
     quietly smoking cigarettes - a clique of devoted
     Nazis. In the group is Major Freyend, the wormy
     officer we saw outside Fromm's office. He watches
     Stauffenberg pass, aloof. We hate him.

                                                         44.



     Just then Stauffenberg is greeted by TWO SS OFFICERS
     who move to physically search him - one his body, the
     other his valise.

                        VOICE (O.S.)
            You don't need to search him.                             

     ANGLE ON: Fromm's adjutant, Lt. Herber approaches,
     waving off the SS.

                          HERBER
            Colonel Stauffenberg is an honored
            guest. The hero of Africa.

     The SS officers stand down. Herber and Stauffenberg              
     share a friendly smile, about to speak when Fromm
     walks up on them:

                           FROMM
            For God's sake, Stauffenberg,                             
            you're-                                                   

     He pauses, clearly caught off guard when he sees                 
     Stauffenberg with two eyes.                                      

                       FROMM (CONT'D)                                 
             ... they're waiting for you.                             


45   INT. THE BERGHOF - CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT                45

     Stauffenberg and Fromm enter to the last thing we
     would expect. Laughter. Drunken laughter.

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL: THE BIG SIX.

     Hitler and five men - some of them almost
     caricatures, their features so distinct. The first
     man we recognize as Keitel - the general who reamed
     Fromm. The others we know from history and TITLES:

     MINISTER ALBERT SPEER - ARCHITECT FOR THE NEW REICH.

     DR. JOSEPH GOEBBELS - REICH MINISTER OF PUBLIC
     ENLIGHTENMENT AND PROPAGANDA.

     REICHSFÜHRER HEINRICH HIMMLER - HEAD OF THE SS AND
     GESTAPO.

     REICH MARSHAL HERMANN GOERING - HEAD OF THE GERMAN
     ARMED FORCES, HITLER'S SECOND IN COMMAND.

                                                    45.



We have arrived in the sanctum sanatorium of Nazi
Germany on the day after the Normandy invasion. But
you would never know the tide of the war had just
turned against Germany. A series of situation maps
are scattered before them, ignored.

Only Speer seems to be reserved, smiling politely but
clearly tuned into the present reality. Looking
closer at Goering we see he is wearing heavy make-up -
adding to the already surreal nature of the scene.

It is also the first time we are allowed a clear,
unobstructed view of Hitler.

                      FROMM
       Mein Führer... I wish to present
       Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg -
       our new Chief of General Staff for
       the Replacement Army.

The laughter stops. Hitler and his cronies turn
toward Stauffenberg, looking him over. Hitler stands
and crosses to him. Fromm meets him first, whispering
in the Führer's ear - perhaps reminding him who
Stauffenberg is. Hitler nods: "Ah yes." He takes
Stauffenberg's left hand with both of his. We are
surprised by his charm.

                     HITLER
       May I say, I am honored to meet a
       hero who has sacrificed so much for
       Germany. If only more of my
       officers were like you.

Hitler's cronies smile despite the subtle insult to
themselves. To make it worse, Hitler turns to them.

                 HITLER (CONT'D)
       Let this man stand as an example to
       all of you. He is the ideal German
       officer.

Fromm nervously clears his throat.

                      FROMM
       Mein Führer, we have asked
       Stauffenberg here today so that he
       might brief us on mobilizing troops
       from the Home Army to support those
       in Normandy.

                                                      46.



                           HITLER
            Hmmm? Oh yes, Normandy. That will
            no longer be necessary. General
            Goering has assured me that
            Normandy is under control.

     Stauffenberg's good eye flickers. "Are you insane?
     Normandy is a catastrophe." Another glance at the
     situation map shows Allied forces over-running.

     But the painted-on smiles of Hitler's nodding cronies
     promote the lie. No one has the courage to tell
     Hitler anything close to the truth. Somewhere in
     their eyes is the fear that someone will.

                        STAUFFENBERG
            Mein Führer, if I may... The
            situation in Normandy is-

                           KEITEL
            You're dismissed, Stauffenberg.

                         STAUFFENBERG
            But-

                           KEITEL
            Send your man home, Fromm. Then
            bring us some brandy.

     Fromm is stung - a man of his rank being treated like
     a waiter. Stauffenberg steps back, clicks his heels
     and salutes, just managing to say:

                        STAUFFENBERG
            Heil Hitler.

     Hitler half waves, walking slowly back to his seat.
     Fromm and Stauffenberg leave.


46   EXT. THE BERGHOF - NIGHT                                46

     Fromm escorts a visibly shaken Stauffenberg to his
     waiting vehicle. Haeften opens the car door for
     Stauffenberg to get in. Fromm leans in.

                           FROMM
            I don't know what you've got
            brewing and I don't want to know...
            But when the music stops, I'd be
            much obliged if Keitel should find
            himself without a chair.

                                                      47.



     Is Fromm saying he's in? Is Keitel's death a
     condition? Hard to say and meant to be. Before
     Stauffenberg can inquire, Fromm slams the door shut
     and returns to the madness inside the Berghof.


47   INT. MILITARY SEDAN - CONTINUOUS                        47

     Stauffenberg leans back in his seat, mentally
     calculating his next step.

                        STAUFFENBERG
            They're all insane. Every one of
            them except for Speer, and he's
            nothing but an architect.

     Stauffenberg puts on his eyepatch before removing his
     glass eye. He polishes it with a cloth and now it
     stares at him from his gloved hand. A conscience.

                    STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
            Tell Beck we've found our
            assassin...
                 (off Haeften's confused look)
            I'll do it myself.


48   INT. CHURCH - NIGHT                                     48

     We find ourselves in an empty church. Beck is seated
     in a pew staring straight ahead. Stauffenberg sits
     directly behind him. They can't risk being seen
     together. They speak in hushed tones.

     The first thing we notice is how weak and ill Beck
     looks. He struggles to hide a persistent cough.

                            BECK
            Out of the question. It won't work.
            We need you here in Berlin.

                       STAUFFENBERG
            Who else, then? Who can even get as
            close?

     Beck knows there is no other choice.

                   STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
            Valkyrie is very clear. Once the
            order is given, the Reserve Army                        
            will automatically seize control of
            the government with or without me.                      

                                                         48.



                            BECK                                      
            Orders are not enough. They need a                        
            man to follow. The right man.                             

     Pause. Stauffenberg knows he's right. The fucking                
     pressure. He thinks for a moment, then with a sigh:              

                       STAUFFENBERG                                   
            Olbricht will oversee operations in                       
            my absence. I can be back in Berlin                       
            three hours after Hitler is-                              

     Stauffenberg shuts up, lowering his head in prayer as
     a CLERGYMAN passes. Once they are again alone:

                            BECK                                      
            Three very crucial hours.

                        STAUFFENBERG
            We both know there's no other way.

     Beck nods, resigned.

                           BECK
            I'll tell the others-

     As if on cue, Beck loses control of his cough.
     Stauffenberg leans forward, handing him a
     handkerchief and putting a reassuring hand on his
     shoulder until the old man's hacking subsides.

                       BECK (CONT'D)
            I'm afraid whatever the outcome, I
            won't be there to see it.

                        STAUFFENBERG
            Nonsense. You're stronger than you
            think. You might just be the
            strongest one of all.                                     


49   EXT. STAUFFENBERG HOME - BAMBERG - DUSK                   49

     Est. The sound of children at play takes us to:


50   EXT. STAUFFENBERG HOME - BACK LAWN - CONTINUOUS           50

     Once again, the scene idyllic. The Stauffenberg
     children play football in the distance. Stauffenberg
     himself is out of uniform for the first time since
     the hospital, but he does not seem relaxed.

                                                   49.



Nina sits across from him, half-reading a book, half
talking to her husband. Stauffenberg cannot hear a
word she is saying - he is miles away.

He looks over at his children. One would never
suspect that Germany has waged a calamitous war and
that the country is facing total devastation.

                       NINA
       ...After that I thought I'd take
       the children to the country for a
       few days to see my- Claus?

He snaps out of his thoughts. "Hmmm?"

                  NINA (CONT'D)
       Have you heard a word I said?

                   STAUFFENBERG
       The country...
                      (thinking)
       Nina. Listen. I want you to delay
       your trip. Just for a while.

She wants to ask, he wants to tell her. Finally:

                       NINA
       Does this have something to do
       with... your work?

                   STAUFFENBERG
       I would just be more comfortable
       knowing where you are - until I'm
       back from Berlin. Things will be
       different then. I promise.

Long pause. Once again, a couple who know each other
well enough to not have to say things plainly. Nina
is worried but strong.

                       NINA
       How long until... until we see you?

                   STAUFFENBERG
       A few days. If all goes well. Then
       we can travel as a family.

                       NINA
       And if things... don't go well?

He hesitates.

                                                         50.



                       STAUFFENBERG
            I love you, Nina.

                           NINA
            And I love you... What-

                          CHILDREN
            PAPA, COME AND PLAY WITH US. (Etc.)

     The children kick the ball toward Stauffenberg - the
     one sport he can play. He is about to say something
     to Nina, but she cuts him off.

                            NINA
            Go be with your children.

     Stauffenberg stands, touching Nina's cheek and
     kissing her forehead. We stay on her as he joins the
     children. She watches them play together, seeing her
     husband laughing for the first time in a long while.
     Her eyes well with tears - a mixture of happiness and
     anguish. Too good to last, too much to bear.


51   INT. SMOKY ROOM - DAY                                     51

     Haeften, Olbricht and Stauffenberg stand around a
     table giving their undivided attention to:

     TITLES: COLONEL MERTZ VON QUIRNHEIM - STAUFFENBERG'S             
     REPLACEMENT UNDER OLBRICHT.

     He empties the contents of two tawny leather
     briefcases onto the table:

     Along with a crude drawing covered with calculations
     he produces two brick-like lumps wrapped in butcher
     paper, two small caps and two thin metal cylinders.

                            MERTZ
            Two 975 gram packs of plastic-W.
            Enough explosive to cripple a
            panzer.
                       (pointing to caps)
            Your detonators.
                    (pointing to cylinders)
            Your fuses. British time pencils.
            This acid capsule is your trigger.

     Stauffenberg carefully studies the items before him.

                                                    51.



                  MERTZ (CONT'D)
       When you're ready to arm, attach
       the detonator to the bottom of the
       time pencil, like so...
                   (demonstrating)
       ...Insert the entire device into
       either end of the plastic-W, crush
       the acid capsule and you're live.
       When the acid eats through the wire
       holding back the trigger spring...
       Well... You'll want to be very far
       away.

                     OLBRICHT
       What if they search your bag?

                   STAUFFENBERG
       I'm one of the inner circle now.
       They'll make sure I am who I am.
       Beyond that, they won't touch me.
                     (to Mertz)
       How much time do I have?

                      MERTZ
       Theoretically there's a 30-minute
       delay. But with the kind of heat
       you can expect at the Wolf's Lair,
       I'd give you 10, 15 minutes tops.

                     HAEFTEN
       That's... hardly precise.                            

                      MERTZ
       This is state of the art. You can
       have small or precise. Not both.

                     OLBRICHT
       Might this be just a little too
       small?

                      MERTZ
       The explosion won't do the killing.
       The air in the room will.

He points to the drawing - an overhead sketch of:

                  MERTZ (CONT'D)
       Hitler's bunker is constructed of
       reenforced concrete. A steel door,
       no windows. Just one of these
       explosives in a space like that
       will cause tremendous air pressure.

                                                   52.

                  MERTZ (CONT'D)
       Enough to instantly kill everyone
       present. The second charge will be
       entirely redundant.

                     OLBRICHT
       Of course, I'm all for redundancy.
       However... If, by some miracle,
       Hitler does survive, what then?

                   STAUFFENBERG
       We have an inside man at the Wolf's
       Lair in communications. He'll
       notify you immediately following
       the flash and then sever all
       contact with the outside world.

The others are stunned.

                     OLBRICHT
       Just how did you manage that?

                   STAUFFENBERG
       It's my job, isn't it? While
       Hitler's inner circle is still
       regrouping, you will initiate
       Valkyrie and seize control in Paris
       and Berlin. Even if Hitler
       survives, we'll have momentum.

                         MERTZ
                      (to Olbricht)
       But as   you said yourself it would
       take a   miracle. Anyone in that
       bunker   when just one of these goes
       off is   not coming out alive.

Haeften places the items back in the briefcases.

                    OLBRICHT
       Himmler is expected to be at the
       meeting as well. Don't proceed
       unless you can get them both.

                   STAUFFENBERG
       That could be difficult.

                     OLBRICHT
       Why kill a madman just to have a
       lunatic take his place?

                   STAUFFENBERG
       This is Goerdeler's idea, isn't it?

                                                      53.



                          OLBRICHT
            The members are in total agreement
            on this.                                               

     Stauffenberg chews on this, pissed. Then:                     

                        STAUFFENBERG                               
            Fucking politicians. I'll hold off                     
            if the decision is unanimous. And I                    
            want another man on the committee.                     
            A soldier.                                             

     A soldier himself, Olbricht is insulted.                      

                          OLBRICHT                                 
            And just who this soldier be?                          

     Stauffenberg glances at Mertz, sizing him, up.                

                        STAUFFENBERG                               
                      (pointing to Mertz)                          
            Him.                                                   

                           OLBRICHT                                
            Him?                                                   

     Mertz's eyes widen. "Me?" But Stauffenberg and                
     Haeften pick up their briefcases and leave without
     another word. Assassins.

     Olbricht reaches for the phone and dials.

                     OLBRICHT (CONT'D)                             
            This is General Olbricht. Order the
            Guard Battalion and all Army
            Schools near Berlin to take up
            march readiness. Stand by for
            Operation Valkyrie.

     CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK...


52   INT. CENTRAL COMMUNICATIONS - BERLIN - DAY             52

     A small, bunker-like room serves as the hub of all
     military communications. The walls are lined with
     chattering teletype machines and their OPERATORS.

     CLOSE ON: One teletype in particular. The words are
     clicking by quickly but we clearly make out:

     STAND BY FOR OPERATION VALKYRIE...

                                                       54.



     One SERGEANT HELM leans in, reading it, curious. He
     tears the sheet out of the teletype and takes it to:

     The officious LIEUTENANT HAANS - officer in charge.
     He likes his job and how well he does it.

                            HELM
                   (handing over the order)
            Lieutenant.

                             HAANS
            What about it?

            This order is calling the Reserve
            Army for some sort of stand-by
            action... in Berlin.

                           HAANS
                           (shrugs)
            Looks like a drill of some kind.

                            HELM
            Valkyrie? I've never heard of that.

                           HAANS
            Send the order through, Sergeant.

     A SHRILL WHISTLE and a WAILING SIREN take us to...             


     EXT. BERLIN - VARIOUS - DAY                                    

     Shots of scattered elements of the Reserve Army                
     coming together, taking shape:                                 

     RESERVISTS and CADETS, from all walks of life, rush            
     to their homes, hastily trading their civilian                 
     clothes for uniforms.                                          


54   EXT. AIRFIELD - RANGSDORF - DAY                         54

     TITLES: 15 JULY 1944.

     Stauffenberg and Haeften board a waiting courier
     plane, preparing for departure. Both are clutching
     their briefcases, faces like stone. Stauffenberg is
     dressed once again in his ornate, formal attire - his
     patch gone, glass eye in place.                                

                                                         55.




     EXT. DEUTSCHLAND GUARD BATTALION - BERLIN - DAY                  

     AIR SIRENS wail. A SCULPTED EAGLE AND SWASTIKA loom              
     over a large pillared stronghold.                                

     From out of the surrounding barracks, RESERVE                    
     SOLDIERS scramble to march readiness, assembling on              
     the center parade grounds, awaiting orders.                      

     Vehicles move into place along the perimeter. All in             
     all, a well-oiled machine.                                       

     CLOSE ON THE BERLIN COMMANDANT - GENERAL PAUL VON                
     HASE - issuing the alert signal. AIR SIRENS wail.                

     RESERVE SOLDIERS scramble into readiness. Vehicles               
     move into place - a well-oiled machine.                          

     We focus on two officers in particular: MAJOR OTTO               
     ERNST REMER, Commander of the Deutschland Guard                  
     Battalion, and SECOND LIEUTENANT DR. HANS HAGEN.                 
     Loyal Nazis both.                                                

                           REMER                                      
            What do you suppose this is all                           
            about?                                                    

                           HAGEN                                      
            Probably just a drill.                                    

     But Remer doesn't seem convinced. Remember him.                  


56   INT./EXT. VARIOUS - DAY                                   56

     Shots of Stauffenberg and Haeften deplaning/getting
     into a waiting car/slowly making their way to their
     destination. Finally, they arrive at:


57   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - DAY                                    57

     Est. A 625 acre compound hidden deep in the mosquito
     infested forests of Wilhelmsdorf. Security is tight -
     barbed wire fencing, checkpoints, flak towers,
     machine gun nests, trenches, land mines.                         

     TITLES: WOLFSCHANZE - "THE WOLF'S LAIR". HITLER'S
     BAVARIAN HEADQUARTERS.

                                                      56.




58   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - MAIN GATE - DAY                      58   

     The car carrying Stauffenberg and Haeften arrives at
     the first security checkpoint.                                 

     TWO GUARDS check identity papers and confiscate                
     pistols from Haeften and The Driver. Stauffenberg              
     boldly extends his valise to one of the Guards, but            
     rather than reach for it, the young soldier snaps to           
     attention and raises his hand in a Nazi salute, eyes           
     straight ahead, stone-like. A drone.                           

     After an awkward pause:                                        

                         STAUFFENBERG                               
                         (to the Driver)                            
            Drive on.                                               


     EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - VARIOUS - DAY                               

     CLOSE ON STAUFFENBERG'S BAG. A series of JUMP CUTS
     follow the bag through the extensive security layers
     one must endure before getting to the meeting. ID is
     checked frequently. The bags, not once. The men here
     are Hitler's inner circle, after all.


59   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - COMPOUND - DAY                       59

     Finally, Stauffenberg and Haeften are escorted toward
     the bunker where the meeting will be held. Pausing,
     Stauffenberg looks back over his shoulder to find:

     THE COMMUNICATIONS HUT - through the open door of the
     small shack we see a mass of radios and telegraphs. A
     LONE FIGURE stands outside, smoking a cigarette.

                           HAEFTEN
                    (whispering to Haeften)                         
            Your man?

     Yes. And it is none other than GENERAL ERICH
     FELLGIEBEL, the man Stauffenberg confronted in the
     bathroom at the Officers' Club so long ago.

     He and Stauffenberg share a long, intense stare.
     Finally, Fellgiebel nods, dropping his cigarette and
     crushing it with his boot. He's in.

     Stauffenberg and Haeften head inside the impervious
     bunker through the heavy steel door.

                                                         57.




60   INT. WOLF'S LAIR - BUNKER - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY           60

     Stauffenberg and Haeften find themselves in a
     cramped, hot, windowless room filled with VARIOUS
     OFFICERS waiting around a large conference table.

     Silence. A moment later, Hitler enters - Keitel and
     Fromm follow close behind. Heels click in unison.
     Keitel starts the meeting, but Stauffenberg isn't
     listening. While all eyes follow Hitler, Stauffenberg
     watches the door, scanning the faces in the room.

                        STAUFFENBERG
                         (whispering)
            Himmler. Where is Himmler?

     Haeften doesn't see him either. Shit.

                          KEITEL
            ...Now for the first order of
            business. Fromm, I believe you will
            brief us on blocking divisions for
            the Eastern Front...

     Stauffenberg silently excuses himself from the room.
     We hold on his briefcase. Remember where he left it.


61   INT. WAR MINISTRY - OLBRICHT'S OFFICE - DAY               61

     The phone rings. A waiting Mertz grabs it.

                            MERTZ
            General Olbricht's Office.
                      (suddenly nervous)
            Hold the line.
                         (to Olbricht)
            Stauffenberg says Himmler's not at
            the briefing. He wants to proceed.                        

     All color drains from Olbricht's face.

                           OLBRICHT
            Call Beck.

     He leaves. Mertz rolls his eyes and dials a second
     phone.

                                                         58.




62   INT. SMOKY ROOM - DAY                                     62

     Beck and Goerdeler sit impatiently by the telephone,
     waiting for any word on the assassination and
     impending coup. When the telephone RINGS:

                             BECK
            Beck.

     He presses the receiver tightly to his ear, a look of
     concern washing over his face. He turns to Goerdeler.

                       BECK (CONT'D)
            Himmler is not in the briefing.

     Goerdeler's reaction is vintage politician. Blank.


63   INT. WOLF'S LAIR - BUNKER - HALLWAY - DAY                 63

     CLOSE ON A CIGARETTE. We watch as Stauffenberg
     smokes, waits, looks at his watch - the sounds of the
     meeting going on behind him. He drops his cigarette
     and we see a pile of three more. He has been waiting
     while the others deliberate. Finally:

                      MERTZ (ON PHONE)
            They say no. Wait.

     (Note: Intercut between Mertz and Stauffenberg.)

     Stauffenberg is furious. He calms himself.

                        STAUFFENBERG
            What do you say?

     Pause. Mertz looks around, makes sure he is alone.

                             MERTZ
            I say do it.

     Stauffenberg hangs up the phone. The moment of truth.


64   INT. WOLF'S LAIR - BUNKER - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY           64

     Stauffenberg quietly slips back into the briefing
     unnoticed. He freezes:

     CLOSE ON: The spot where Stauffenberg left his
     briefcase. Remember? Well it's gone.

                                                         59.



     He looks around frantically. Some officers notice
     him. Tension mounts. He gets Haeften's attention.

                        STAUFFENBERG
                          (mouthing)
            My briefcase.

     Before Haeften can answer, Fromm shoots them both a
     glare. "What the hell are you doing?"

                           KEITEL
            ...Gentleman. You are dismissed.

     And like that, the briefing has ended. Stauffenberg
     is sickened - the opportunity lost. Hitler exits,
     walking right past him. Keitel and the rest file out.
     The last to leave is Fromm.

                           FROMM
            That call better have been
            important.

     Stauffenberg turns, coming face-to-face with Freyend,
     Keitel's hateful toady. He holds the missing
     briefcase. For a moment we're sure the jig is up.

                          FREYEND
            Your bag... Colonel.

     He hands it over and leaves.


65   EXT. DEUTSCHLAND GUARD BATTALION - BERLIN - DAY           65

     A military sedan skids to a stop outside the Guard
     Battalion headquarters. Olbricht jumps from the car,
     racing to get General Hase's attention.

     LARGE FORMATIONS of soldiers stand at attention in
     the hot sun, awaiting orders.

                            HASE
                         (whispering)
            What the hell is going on? My men
            have been standing here for an
            hour. I don't know what to tell
            them.

     CLOSE ON REMER (the officer we told you to remember)
     standing before the ranks. He eyes Hase and Olbricht
     suspiciously, trying to hear what they are saying.
     After a moment, Hase addresses the men.

                                                 60.



                  HASE (CONT'D)
       At ease, gentlemen.

Olbricht addresses the men, trying unsuccessfully to
hide his nerves.

                     OLBRICHT
       This has been a drill. You're all
       to be commended for your quick
       response. Dismissed.

Pause. The men linger, confused until:

                OLBRICHT (CONT'D)
       HEIL HITLER.

                      SOLDIERS
       HEIL HITLER.

And the men fall out, nowhere to go so they just
light up and shoot the shit. Hagen approaches Remer.

                      HAGEN
       What did I tell you? A drill.

But Remer is not so sure. The way he stares at
Olbricht makes us nervous.

CLOSE ON: Olbricht sees Remer looking at him, making
note of the esteemed KNIGHT'S CROSS pinned to Remer's     
uniform. Olbricht leans toward Hase.

                    OLBRICHT
       That man there. Who is he?

                       HASE
       Major Remer? He commands the
       Deutschland Guard Battalion. What
       about him?

                     OLBRICHT
       Get rid of him.

                      HASE
       Remer? Don't worry about him. He's
       an order taker. To the bone.

Ah yes... But whose orders?

                                                          61.




66   INT. WAR MINISTRY - OUTSIDE FROMM'S OFFICE - DAY           66

     As usual, Lt. Herber sits at his desk and, as usual,
     he tries to ignore:

     MUTED SHOUTS through Fromm's office door. PULL BACK
     TO REVEAL Stauffenberg and Olbricht waiting.

     They sit across from, Freyend. A beat later, Keitel
     storms out of Fromm's office, his face red with
     anger. Deja vu. When Keitel and Freyend are gone:

     Herber looks up from his desk with a nervous smile.

                           HERBER
            The General will see you now.

     Stauffenberg and Olbricht stand, hats in hand.


67   INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER         67

                           FROMM
            How dare you put the Reserve Army
            on standby without my knowledge.
            You damn near cost me my
            commission. What in God's name made
            you think you even had the
            authority?

                          OLBRICHT
            It was only a drill. An exercise.

                           FROMM
            DON'T LIE, OLBRICHT. Not to me. We
            both know it was no fucking drill.

                        STAUFFENBERG
            General, if I may-

                           FROMM
            You may not, Colonel. You may not
            do anything. Because now you've not
            only shown me you can't deliver,
            you've painted a target on my back.
            If I so much as sense you trying to
            move the Reserve Army again, I'll
            personally have you both arrested.
            Do I make myself abundantly clear?

                   STAUFFENBERG/OLBRICHT
            Yes, sir.

                                                         62.



                               FROMM
            Heil Hitler.

                           OLBRICHT
            Heil Hitler.

     But Stauffenberg turns to leave without answering.

                           FROMM
            I'll hear you say it, Colonel.

     Stauffenberg stops, glaring at Fromm with his one
     eye. He squares his shoulders, clicks his heels
     loudly and delivers a downright Nazi-like:

                        STAUFFENBERG
            HEIL HITLER.

     Still managing to make it sound spiteful. He leaves
     without being dismissed, slamming the door.


68   INT. SMOKY ROOM - NIGHT                                   68

     It has been a long day, the Resistance leaders are
     all exhausted. Beck, Olbricht, Witzleben, Haeften and
     Mertz watch Goerdeler circling a rigid Stauffenberg.

                         GOERDELER
            The point of your central solution
            is to replace Hitler so that we can
            negotiate a truce with the Allies.
            The Allies, I suspect, would be
            more amenable to a truce... IF WE
            OFFER IT TO THEM BEFORE THEY ARE IN
            FUCKING BERLIN.

                        STAUFFENBERG
            Today was a matter of indecision -
            nothing more. A military operation
            in the hands of a politician.

     Stauffenberg's lack of respect infuriates Goerdeler.

                         GOERDELER
            I don't think I am alone when I say
            your judgement is in question.
                        (to the others)
            I would like to take a vote.

                               BECK
            Carl.

                                                    63.



                     GOERDELER
       I DEMAND THAT WE RELIEVE COLONEL
       STAUFFENBERG.

                       BECK
       Carl, if I may have a word with you
       in private.

                    GOERDELER
       If you have something to say,
       Ludwig, say it here. Say it now.

                       BECK
       Very well. There's no need to vote.

Beck turns to the bar, pours two drinks. Stauffenberg
stiffens, ready for the axe.

                  BECK (CONT'D)
       I consider you a friend. And I look
       forward to the day when we can once
       again live as free men. But you've
       become a liability.

Goerdeler smiles smugly. But the smile fades when
Beck turns, offering a drink to him.

                  BECK (CONT'D)
       I'm sorry it has to be this way.

                    GOERDELER
       Wha... What are you saying?

                       BECK
       Fellgiebel informed me this
       evening... Himmler's issued an
       order for your arrest. You'll have
       to leave Germany. Tonight. When
       we've succeeded with the central
       solution you'll return as
       Chancellor. Until then-

Goerdeler stands, confronting Stauffenberg.

                    GOERDELER
       This is your doing, isn't it? ISN'T
       IT? You can't just get rid of me
       like this. I am the man Germany
       will follow. I'm... I...

Stauffenberg says nothing. He's too cool. Goerdeler
looks at the other conspirators, but no one is going
to speak for him. Finally, almost in tears:

                                                 64.



                GOERDELER (CONT'D)
       Ludwig, I-

Beck offers him an envelope.

                      BECK
       Disappear, Carl. Avoid contact with
       anyone.

Ugly pause. Goerdeler snatches the envelope and sulks
out. We could not be happier to see him go. Beck
coughs, turns to Stauffenberg.

                  BECK (CONT'D)
       No more indecision. From now on,
       Stauffenberg has discretion.                       

                     OLBRICHT
       I can't issue Valkyrie again unless
       we follow through. If he fails to-                 

                   STAUFFENBERG
       I'll do my job. You just take
       Berlin.                                            


INT. STAUFFENBERG'S BERLIN FLAT - NIGHT                   

CLOSE ON: A telephone. Stauffenberg's three fingered      
hand picks up the receiver and lifts it out of frame.     

               STAUFFENBERG (V.O.)                        
       I'd like to place a call to                        
       Bamberg, please.                                   


INT. STAUFFENBERG HOME - BAMBERG - NIGHT                  

Nina and her children eat supper around a single          
candle, Bamberg is experiencing a blackout. Though        
Nina manages a tranquil facade she is anything but.       

ANGLE ON: The silent telephone in the foreground. We      
wait for it to ring, but it never does.                   


INT. CHURCH - NIGHT                                       

Beck enters to find Stauffenberg in the front pew,        
staring at Christ on the cross.                           

                                                 65.



                       BECK                              
       Have you made your peace with God,                
       then?                                             

                   STAUFFENBERG                          
       As best I can.                                    

                       BECK                              
       Then you have nothing to fear.                    

Stauffenberg manages a smile as Beck sits.               

                  STAUFFENBERG                           
       I know the soldier inside me is a                 
       traitor. I wonder how I'll be                     
       judged as a man.                                  

                        BECK                             
       By history?                                       

                     STAUFFENBERG                        
       By God.                                           

                       BECK                              
       In the end, we answer only to                     
       ourselves.                                        

Stauffenberg fingers the cross and ring hanging from     
the chain around his neck.                               

                  BECK (CONT'D)                          
       Did you reach your wife?                          

                  STAUFFENBERG                           
       Bombing in Ebingen. I can't get                   
       through.                                          

                       BECK                              
       Ebingen is a long way from Bamberg.               
       They're safe. You've seen to that.                
                   (realizing...)                        
       To think... You came to us a                      
       wounded soldier from Africa. Now...               
       Now you are both the architect and                
       the assassin. I'm still trying to                 
       understand how this came to be.                   

                   STAUFFENBERG                          
                  (more to himself)                      
       Like a farmer watching the corn                   
       grow. One day it's over his head...               

                                                         66.



                             BECK                                     
            What's that?                                              

                         STAUFFENBERG                                 
            Nothing...                                                

     And the two men look up at the cross in silence.                 


71   EXT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - DAYBREAK                         71   

     In these waking hours Berlin appears quite peaceful.
     Only the distant sound of shelling reminds us that
     the city is surrounded by war.


72   INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS             72

     A tawny leather briefcase sits on a neatly made bed.

     Stauffenberg, freshly bathed and wrapped in a towel,
     shaves in front of the mirror. For the first time we
     see his scars and deformities in full. He looks
     himself over, finally focusing on the chain around
     his neck, contemplating the small cross and the ring -
     its engraving: finis-initium [end-beginning].

     Though his face is clean-shaven now, he continues,
     slowly running the razor down his throat. Then he
     stops, pressing the blade a little too hard and
     bringing blood. It almost seems intentional.

     CLOSE ON: The box that holds his glass eye, staring.


73   INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - BEDROOM - LATER                  73

     Stauffenberg has since mastered the process of
     dressing himself. JUMP CUTS take us from a wounded
     soldier to an officer of the General Staff.

     CLOSE ON: His crisp white collar, picking up a trace
     of blood from the cut on his throat.


74   EXT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - DAY                              74

     TITLES: 20 JULY 1944. 6:00 AM.

     Haeften holds the door for Stauffenberg, stepping                
     into a military sedan.                                           

                                                         67.




75   EXT. BERLIN - VARIOUS - DAY                               75

     For the first time we see Berlin in broad daylight -
     the city in ruins. The drive through the rubbled,
     smoky streets is particularly eerie today.                       


78   EXT. AIRFIELD - RANGSDORF - DAY                           78

     TITLES: 7:00 AM.

     Haeften and Stauffenberg board a three-engine courier
     plane - each carrying a leather briefcase. A moment
     later the plane is taking off.                                   


79   INT. SMOKY ROOM - DAY                                     79

     A group of 30 RESISTANCE OFFICERS talk quietly,
     smoking cigarettes and waiting anxiously. Many of the
     faces we recognize, some we see for the first time.
     We notice Witzleben has donned his old military
     uniform, looking a little too proud.

     Beck looks over the faces of these men, trying to
     contain his own fear. His eye catches the door
     opening and a MAN IN A DECORATED POLICE UNIFORM
     entering the room. We tense.

     One by one, the men in the room stop talking, staring
     at the police officer. Just as we think it's over:

                            BECK
            Gentlemen, may I introduce Chief
            Helldorf. He's guaranteed the full
            support of the Berlin Police.

     Helldorf nods. The men breathe a collective sigh of
     relief. Some laugh. Many shake Helldorf's hand.

                       BECK (CONT'D)
            We can begin.

     Beck moves to a table covered with maps of Berlin,
     Paris and the Wolf's Lair.

                       BECK (CONT'D)
            Hitler has scheduled a military
            briefing for today at one o'clock.
            Stauffenberg will strike regardless
            of who else is present.

                                                         68.



     As Beck speaks, we see how things should play out...


80   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - DAY                                    80

     Stauffenberg and Haeften are driven in a topless
     sedan. Each carries his leather briefcase.

                        BECK (V.O.)
            Once in position, he will signal us
            once to alert the troops and again
            after the flash...


81   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - BUNKER - DAY                           81

     Stauffenberg and Haeften quickly get in the sedan -
     the concrete bunker just behind him - its steel door
     closed. They speed out of frame a beat before a
     muffled explosion rocks the bunker - the steel door
     bulges but holds fast. Only a wisp of smoke escapes.


82   INT. WAR MINISTRY- FROMM'S OFFICE - DAY                   82

     SOLDIERS burst into Fromm's office and arrest the
     bewildered General without incident.

                        BECK (V.O.)
            Assuming Fromm refuses to join us,
            Olbricht will take Command of the
            Reserve Army and initiate Operation
            Valkyrie.

     Olbricht takes Fromm's place and starts making calls.
     At least this is how it should happen...


83   INT./EXT. BERLIN - VARIOUS - DAY                          83

     Establishing shots of the idle troops and equipment
     as they are once again called into action.

                        BECK (V.O.)
            Then he'll notify all district
            commanders between Paris and Berlin
            that the SS is attempting to seize
            power. The Reserve Army will arrest
            all SS, Gestapo and Nazi officials.

     The same soldiers are now storming government
     buildings and seizing personnel.

                                                         69.




84   INT. WAR MINISTRY - DAY                                   84

     Witzleben and Beck march in with ARMED SOLDIERS.

                        BECK (V.O.)
            When the time is right, Witzleben
            and I will arrive at the War
            Ministry and assume the roles of
            Commander of the Armed Forces and
            Head of State, respectively.


85   INT. RADIO STATION - DAY                                  85

     Goerdeler stands at a radio microphone, reading
     passionately from a prepared script with dramatic
     gestures painfully reminiscent of Hitler.

                        BECK (V.O.)
            With Berlin secured, Goerdeler will
            return and address the nation as
            our new Chancellor. Then, God
            willing, we can negotiate a truce
            with the Allies and spare Europe
            from total destruction.


86   INT. SMOKY ROOM - DAY                                     86

                            BECK
            Gentlemen, this is the most
            important day of your lives. Long
            live sacred Germany.                                      

     The conspirators salute and leave. Beck places both
     hands on the table to support himself, coughing and
     exhausted. Then he looks nervously at his watch...


87   INT. WAR MINISTRY - OLBRICHT'S OFFICE - DAY               87   

     Olbricht paces before his desk. Mertz watches him,               
     anxiously waiting for:

                           MERTZ
            Put the Reserve Army on standby                           
            alert.

                          OLBRICHT
            Not until I hear from Stauffenberg.
            Not until I'm sure.                                       

                                                         70.



                           MERTZ
            But that's not what he-

                          OLBRICHT
            Noted, Colonel. Thank you.


88   EXT. AIRFIELD - RASTENBURG - DAY                          88   

     The plane touches down and taxis to a stop.
     Stauffenberg and Haeften deplane and immediately step
     into a waiting courier car driven by a young, dutiful
     Nazi. SECOND LIEUTENANT KRETZ. Remember him.


89   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - DAY                                    89

     Even this early, the heat is oppressive.

     We watch from a distance as the courier car is
     stopped at the outer checkpoint. Once again, the
     GUARD carefully examines Stauffenberg and Haeften's
     identification and takes their pistols before
     allowing the car to pass. We follow.


90   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - KEITEL'S OFFICE - DAY                  90

     Est. Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel's office as the
     courier car arrives.                                             

     Stauffenberg and Haeften are greeted by Freyend who              
     shows them to:                                                   


91   INT. KEITEL'S OFFICE - WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS          91

     TWO OFFICERS are already waiting. They stand...

                          FREYEND
            Gentlemen, may I present Colonel
            Claus von Stauffenberg - Chief
            Officer of the Reserve Army.

                         OFFICER #1
            Colonel Stauffenberg. This is an
            honor. They say you're the man that
            will defend Berlin from the Red
            Army single-hand-

     The officer realizes what a faux pas he has made as
     soon as he says it. Unfazed, Stauffenberg smiles,
     raising his briefcase with his single hand.

                                                    71.



                   STAUFFENBERG
       Indeed. I've got the whole bag of
       tricks right here.

The officers laugh nervously, relieved he was not
insulted. Idiots. Meanwhile, Freyend steps toward
Haeften, reaching for the handle of his briefcase.

                     FREYEND
       Let me take that for you.

But Haeften snaps the case back. Freyend raises a
suspicious eye. Before he can press:                        

                   VOICE (O.S.)                             
       Colonel Stauffenberg?

Everyone turns to find General Fellgiebel standing at       
the door. Everyone stands at attention.                     

                    FELLGIEBEL                              
       At east, Gentlemen.                                  
                  (to Stauffenberg)                         
       General Fellgiebel, communications.                  
       I just wanted to meet the hero of                    
       Africa... And see if there's                         
       anything you need.                                   

                   STAUFFENBERG
       Yes, sir, there is. I'm expecting a                  
       call of the utmost importance. Even                  
       if it comes when I am in conference                  
       with the Führer I'd appreciate it                    
       if you had a man come and get me.                    

Beat. Fellgiebel and Stauffenberg share an instant
look of understanding.

                    FELLGIEBEL
       Of course, Colonel.

Fellgiebel salutes. Stauffenberg and the others             
return it as Fellgiebel departs. Just then, Keitel          
bursts from his office, fixing his tie.

                      KEITEL
       Gentlemen. The meeting has been
       pushed forward to 12:30. Mussolini
       is arriving on the afternoon train
       and Hitler wants to have lunch with
       him.

Stauffenberg is excited by a potential bonus.

                                                         72.



                        STAUFFENBERG
            Will Mussolini be in the briefing?

                           KEITEL
            I only wish he were. Then some
            ambitious officer might take the
            opportunity to shoot the dago
            bastard.

     Keitel makes a beeline for the door and the others
     follow like good sheep. Stauffenberg holds back,
     however, attracting Freyend's attention.

                        STAUFFENBERG
            I'll need a place to wash up -
            change my shirt.

     Stauffenberg points to the shaving cut on his throat
     and the tiny blood stain on his shirt. The cut was
     intentional after all.

     Annoyed, Freyend motions to the adjoining anteroom.

                          FREYEND
            Please, do be quick. You heard the
            General.

     Stauffenberg nods in appreciation. He motions for
     Haeften to follow him. Freyend watches, curious.


92   INT. KEITEL'S OFFICE - CHANGING ROOM - DAY                92

     Fast on Stauffenberg's heels, Haeften closes the
     door. A large portrait of Hitler looms, watching.
     Stauffenberg positions himself at a small desk with
     his back to the door. He removes a brick of plastic
     explosive from his briefcase.

                          HAEFTEN
                         (whispering)
            You're arming them... now?                                

     Stauffenberg quickly unbuttons his shirt, taking a
     clean one out of his bag and putting it on as:

     Haeften assembles a fuse.

                       STAUFFENBERG
            No room for error this time. Assume
            I have ten minutes in this heat.

                                                         73.

                   STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
            Two minutes for the walk, one for
            the security check and one to the
            bunker. Three minutes for the walk
            back. That's seven.

                          HAEFTEN
            Leaving just three minutes to place
            the bomb.

                        STAUFFENBERG
            Plenty of time.

                          HAEFTEN
            If the bomb goes off in ten.

     He carefully inserts the fuse into the explosive.

     The RING OF A TELEPHONE startles us.


93   INT. KEITEL'S OFFICE - WAITING ROOM - DAY                 93

     CLOSE ON THE TELEPHONE. Freyend answers.

                          FREYEND
            Major Freyend speaking.
                            (beat)
            Stauffenberg? Yes, he's arrived...
            They are on their way now.

     Freyend hangs up, glancing impatiently at his watch.


94   INT. KEITEL'S OFFICE - CHANGING ROOM - DAY                94

     Neatly dressed again, Stauffenberg carefully places
     the primed explosive back in his briefcase. He and
     Haeften turn their attention to the second explosive -
     assembling the fuse, about to insert it when:

     BANG. The door swings suddenly open - stopped short
     by Stauffenberg's backside. He nearly drops the fuse.

                        STAUFFENBERG
            Dammit man, what is it?

     It's Freyend, of course, trying to peer through the
     partially opened door. Stauffenberg hides the bombs
     with his body.

                          FREYEND
            General Keitel insists that the
            Colonel please hurry.

                                                         74.



     Haeften scoops the unarmed explosive into his
     briefcase. Stauffenberg motions for Haeften to leave.


95   INT. KEITEL'S OFFICE - HALLWAY - DAY                      95

     Haeften comes out, moving Freyend back with his body
     and shutting the door behind him - a charged moment.

                          HAEFTEN
            The Colonel is changing, Major. You
            understand this can be difficult.

     Freyend backs down. A little.


96   INT. KEITEL'S OFFICE - CHANGING ROOM - DAY                96

     Stauffenberg produces a pair of pliers (one handle
     specially bent for easier use by a man with only
     three fingers). With some effort, he manages to
     secure the pliers around the fuse.

     CLOSE ON THE ACID CAPSULE OF THE FUSE. The jaws of
     the pliers gently squeeze, crushing it. The bomb is
     live. There is no turning back now.

     Stauffenberg closes his briefcase and opens the door,
     greeted by Freyend and Haeften.


97   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - OUTSIDE KEITEL'S OFFICE - DAY          97

     Freyend scurries, trying to catch up with Keitel.
     Stauffenberg and Haeften lag behind.

                        STAUFFENBERG
                         (to Haeften)
            See that the car is ready.

     Haeften looks down at the briefcase in his hand - the
     second, unarmed explosive inside.

                           HAEFTEN
            But sir-

                        STAUFFENBERG
            I have everything I need,
            Lieutenant. Thank you.

     Haeften reluctantly takes his leave just as Freyend
     turns back, eager for Stauffenberg to pick up the
     pace. He reaches for the briefcase.

                                                         75.



                          FREYEND
            Please. Let me help you with that.

                        STAUFFENBERG
                       (pulling it away)
            I can manage, thank you.

     Freyend seems more than just a little peeved. But
     Stauffenberg doesn't notice. He is focused straight
     ahead, mentally calculating what time he has left.

     The bunker suddenly seems miles away.


98   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - OUTSIDE BUNKER - DAY                   98

     Security Perimeter I. Keitel and his men file through
     the heavily guarded entrance. Each man holds up his
     pass for the GUARDS to inspect. Stauffenberg is last.

     Keitel heads toward a wooden structure up ahead -
     AWAY FROM THE BUNKER. Stauffenberg is confused.

                        STAUFFENBERG
            Where are they going?

                          FREYEND
            It's too hot. The briefing has been
            moved to the conference hut.

     ANGLE ON: The conference hut. The door and many
     windows of the flimsy wooden structure are all open.
     Not ideal for generating the deadly air pressure
     vital to Stauffenberg's plan. But this obstacle only
     seems to strengthen his resolve. He is a soldier
     after all. And no military operation goes according
     to plan. Making matters worse:

                      FREYEND (CONT'D)
            Sir, your briefcase. I insist.

     Annoyed but not wanting to arouse suspicion,
     Stauffenberg finally acquiesces, handing it over. He
     watches Freyend carry the bomb into the hut. Pause.

     Stauffenberg looks back over his shoulder to:

     Fellgiebel - standing by the communications building.
     The man who will get Stauffenberg out of the room
     before the bomb goes off. They share a nod. Then
     Stauffenberg steps into the hut.                                 

                                                       76.




99    INT. CONFERENCE HUT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS               99

      In the room beyond we see Hitler at the end of a long
      table surrounded by RANKING OFFICERS. One by one,
      they present their individual briefings to the
      nodding Führer. Stauffenberg whispers to Freyend.

                         STAUFFENBERG
             My injuries left me a bit hard of
             hearing. See that you place me as
             near the Führer as possible.

      Freyend nods, but for now his concerns are elsewhere -
      wrangling everyone into the meeting.

      Like the other officers, Stauffenberg hangs up his
      belt and hat on hooks at the entrance to the briefing
      room. He catches sight of SERGEANT-MAJOR ADAM, the
      conference hut's young telephone operator.

                    STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
             Sergeant. I'm expecting an urgent
             call from Berlin...


100   INT. CONFERENCE HUT - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY                100

      A small room measuring 15 by 32 feet. Stifling heat.             
      We notice again that the windows are open to let in
      some air. Hitler and his officers hunch over a long,
      heavy table covered in detailed maps of Eastern
      Europe and the Soviet Union.

      LIEUTENANTS and SERGEANTS continually tiptoe in and
      out of the room. A GENERAL stands beside Hitler in
      the middle of his briefing:

                           GENERAL
             The Eastern Front forces are
             assured a victory... but they need
             reinforcements.

      In other words, they are getting pounded but he can't
      say that. The General is relived to be interrupted by
      Keitel's arrival. The briefing stops momentary as:

                            KEITEL
             Please pardon our tardiness... You
             remember Colonel Stauffenberg?

                                                   77.



Hitler makes a deliberate effort to shake
Stauffenberg's hand, their eyes lock - an unnerving
moment. Stauffenberg has come to kill this man
greeting him. The moment is broken when the General
clears his throat, continuing his presentation.

                     GENERAL
       As you can see, Mein Führer, the
       situation in the East Prussian
       sector is increasingly critical...
                 (and on and on...)

Freyend startles Stauffenberg slightly when he takes
him by the arm, moving him to his place at the table -
less than half a step from Hitler. He is squeezed in
between two other officers. We suck in wind when we
see who one of them is...

COLONEL HEINZ BRANDT - the same Brandt who carried
the bottles of Cointreau onto Hitler's plane so long
ago. He still scribbles in his damn datebook.

Freyend sets the briefcase beside Stauffenberg -
bumping Brandt's leg. Brandt looks down at the
briefcase - long enough to make us nervous.

He watches as Stauffenberg nonchalantly bends down,
sliding the briefcase as close to Hitler as possible,
leaning it against the heavy wooden table support
immediately to the right of Hitler's foot.                 

Stauffenberg looks back at the open door, glances at
his watch. He can clearly see Sergeant Adam, the
telephone operator. Where is his God-damn phone call?

Around him generals talk, Hitler nods, but we hear
nothing. Only the pulse of Stauffenberg's heartbeat
in his own ears - the only thing betraying his
otherwise outward calm.

He looks down at the briefcase - the bomb just under
his feet. He looks at Hitler nodding. The longer we
stay, the more excruciating it is. So we milk it.

Stauffenberg is startled when a hand touches his arm.
The annoying Freyend is there, whispering in his ear.
Keitel sees this, irritated by the interruption.
Stauffenberg makes a gesture to Keitel with his hand,
indicating a phone call. Keitel is not pleased.

                                                          78.




101   INT. CONFERENCE HUT - HALLWAY - DAY                       101

      Freyend leads Stauffenberg to Adam who offers the
      telephone receiver.

                             ADAM
             General Fellgiebel, sir. He says
             it's urgent.

      Stauffenberg takes the phone and stares at Freyend
      and Adam - they get the idea that this is a private
      call and leave. When they are gone, Stauffenberg
      simply lays the receiver down and walks out. Fast.

      A moment later, Adam returns to the room. He sees the
      receiver laying there. Odd. Looking down the hallway
      he sees Stauffenberg quickly exiting the building.

      Then he notices Stauffenberg's hat and belt still
      hanging outside the briefing room.

                        ADAM (CONT'D)
             Colonel... Colonel, you forgot your-


102   INT. CONFERENCE HUT - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY                 102

      Hitler leans on his elbows carefully studying the map
      before him as the General's presentation drags on.

      Brandt moves in closer, filling the void left by
      Stauffenberg. His foot hits something. He looks at:

      Stauffenberg's briefcase as it falls over.

      Slowly, Brandt reaches down, picking up the
      briefcase, looking around for Stauffenberg. He
      considers the bag for a moment and we are sure he is
      going to open it.

      But then he puts it back under the table. But now the
      heavy wooden support is BETWEEN Hitler and the bomb.

                           GENERAL
             ...And now I believe Colonel
             Stauffenberg will present us with
             his deployment for the Replacement
             Army should the unthinkable occur
             and the Russians reach-

      Where is Stauffenberg? Keitel shoots Freyend a look.

                                                          79.




103   INT. CONFERENCE HUT - HALLWAY - DAY                       103

      Freyend steps into the hall. No sign of Stauffenberg.
      Sergeant Adam approaches, looking confused.

                           FREYEND
             Where the hell is Stauffenberg?

      But Adam shrugs, holding out Stauffenberg's hat.


104   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - COMMUNICATIONS BUILDING - DAY          104   

      Fellgiebel and Haeften watch anxiously as
      Stauffenberg clears the security checkpoint and walks
      toward them, slow and deliberate - eerily calm.                   


      INT. CONFERENCE HUT - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY                         

      Hitler at the far end of the room, bent over the                  
      conference table, leaning on his elbows.                          

      A MASSIVE, EAR-SPLITTING EXPLOSION lifts the table                
      up, throwing Hitler back and simultaneously                       
      vaporizing the men standing on either side of him.                


      EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - CONFERENCE HUT - DAY                           

      The hut explodes outward like a house of cards.                   
      Bodies are thrown clear. Everyone hits the deck
      except Stauffenberg. He just keeps walking.                       

      A great cloud of smoke billows from the ruins. The                
      sky is alive with a swirl of burnt paper scraps and
      ash. STUNNED OFFICERS are running about. Shouting.
      Screaming. Absolute chaos.

      Even knowing it was coming, Haeften is stunned.
      Stauffenberg walks up to the communications building
      and takes him by the arm, turning to Fellgiebel.

                        STAUFFENBERG
             Contact General Olbricht in Berlin.
             Tell him Hitler is dead. Proceed
             with Operation Valkyrie. Then sever
             all communications.

      Fellgiebel nods and rushes to make the call.
      Stauffenberg leads Haeften to their waiting car -
      still driven by young Lt. Kretz.

                                                        80.


      He too is stunned by the explosion - so much so that
      he does not think to get out and open the door for
      his passengers. Stauffenberg climbs in next to Kretz,
      pushing Haeften in the back.

                      STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
                             (to Kretz)
             Drive.
                           (Kretz lingers)
             LIEUTENANT.

      Kretz snaps out of it and jams the car in gear,
      speeding off down the forested trail. Stauffenberg
      and Haeften look back for a clear view of the total
      destruction. Bodies are carried out of the demolished
      hut - the grounds littered with the wounded.

      Surly there is no way the Führer could have survived.


105   INT. COMMUNICATIONS HUT - DAY                           105

      Fellgiebel holds a phone to his ear.

                   FELLGIEBEL (INTO PHONE)
             I said Olbricht. General Olbricht
             at the War Ministry. The call is
             urgent.

      A breathless COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER enters, pointing
      in mute shock to the ruin outside.

                    COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
             What the hell just happened?

                          FELLGIEBEL
             What does it look like? The Führer
             is-

      Fellgiebel freezes, something catching his eye.

      COME AROUND TO HIS P.O.V. Share his horror. Through
      the window, Fellgiebel has a clear view of the
      conference hut, or rather what's left.

      HITLER - limping, dazed, his clothes in tatters - is
      being led from the smoldering ruins. He is very much:

                        FELLGIEBEL (CONT'D)
             Alive...

                                                           81.




106   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - INNER SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY         106

      Kretz brings the car to a sudden stop at the first
      checkpoint. A barricade is in place. A GUARD
      approaches. Stauffenberg and Haeften hold up passes.

                         STAUFFENBERG
             We have to get to the airfield at
             once. Orders form the Führer.

      The guard signals his men to remove the barricade.


107   INT. COMMUNICATIONS HUT - MOMENTS LATER                    107

      Fellgiebel waits to be connected to the War Ministry
      in Berlin. His Communications Officer awaits orders.
      This makes it hard for Fellgiebel to speak plainly.
      He plays up his distress for his audience.

                   FELLGIEBEL (INTO PHONE)
             I am calling from The Wolf's Lair
             with urgent news for the General.
             Something terrible has happened...

      Then he turns his back, lowers his voice.

                     FELLGIEBEL (CONT'D)
                          (whispering)
             The Führer is still alive.

                       VOICE (ON PHONE)
             I'm sorry. Please come again.

      But Fellgiebel's officer is watching him, trying to
      hear. Fellgiebel has no choice but to hang up.

                          FELLGIEBEL
             Sever all communications.

                     COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
             Sir?

                          FELLGIEBEL
             DON'T ARGUE WITH ME, DAMMIT. JUST
             DO IT.


108   INT. WAR MINISTRY - OLBRICHT'S OFFICE - DAY                108

      Olbricht anxiously hovers over Mertz who shouts into
      the phone.

                                                    82.



                      MERTZ
       I didn't hear you. Come again.
       Fellgiebel. FELLGIEBEL.

But it's no use. Mertz slowly hangs up the phone.

                     OLBRICHT
       Well, what did he say?

                      MERTZ
       I... couldn't be sure. It sounded
       as though he said... Hitler is
       still alive.

Olbricht clinches his teeth and starts sweating.

                     OLBRICHT
       Get him back on the line.

                      MERTZ
       Sir... The bomb did go off. That
       much was clear. Fellgiebel's next
       step will be to sever all
       communications.

Olbricht is confused. Frozen.                               

                  MERTZ (CONT'D)
       Colonel Stauffenberg was explicit.
       We initiate Valkyrie regardless.

                     OLBRICHT
       Only Fromm can initiate. You know
       that.

                      MERTZ
       Then lie. Tell him Hitler's dead.
       Or arrest him. But do it now.                        

But Olbricht is frozen.

                  MERTZ (CONT'D)
       Sir... Did you hear me? You have to
       give the order to initiate
       Valkyrie. This is our only-

                     OLBRICHT
       I'm not doing anything until I talk
       to Fellgiebel. Get him back on the
       phone. NOW.

Mertz shakes his head bitterly and dials, but he'll
never get through.

                                                           83.




109   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - OUTER SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY         109

      Stauffenberg's car presses on through the woods
      toward the last security checkpoint, but numerous new
      road barriers are in place. This is not good.

      One SERGEANT KOLBE and TWO ARMED SOLDIERS step from
      the guardhouse, signalling Kretz to stop.

                            KOLBE
             No one gets in or out.

                         STAUFFENBERG
             We're on orders from the Führer. We
             have to get to the airfield
             immediately. You will step aside.

                            KOLBE
             I'm sorry, sir, but my orders are-

      Stauffenberg steps out of the vehicle and makes a
      beeline for the guardroom. Kolbe races after him.


110   INT. GUARDROOM - CONTINUOUS                                110

      Stauffenberg snatches up the telephone before Kolbe
      and his men can stop him.

                         STAUFFENBERG
             Get me General Keitel.

      Stauffenberg wipes a single bead of sweat from his
      brow. With the guards hovering over him, he turns and
      casually sits on the desk, blocking the phone with
      his body. He surreptitiously rests his hand on the
      telephone cradle, hanging up. He talks to no one.

                    STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
             Yes... General Keitel. Stauffenberg
             here. I can't get past the outer
             gate. A Sergeant...

      He looks at Kolbe. Kolbe swallows.

                             KOLBE
             Kolbe.

                         STAUFFENBERG
             Sergeant Kolbe says no one is
             getting out... Yes. Yes. Maybe you
             can explain it to him.

                                                        84.



      Stauffenberg holds out the phone - staring hard,
      bluffing harder. Kolbe considers the phone. Finally:

                             KOLBE
              That won't be necessary, Colonel.


111   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - OUTER SECURITY CHECKPOINT - LATER    111

      A humiliated Kolbe watches Stauffenberg's car speed
      away from the open barriers. Free.


112   INT. CAR - DAY                                          112

      Silence but for the chattering engine. Kretz is
      distracted by movement in the rearview mirror.

      P.O.V. IN REARVIEW MIRROR. Haeften rummages through
      his briefcase, removing objects Kretz can't make out
      - tossing them, one by one, into the woods. Haeften
      realizes he is being watched by Kretz in the mirror
      and shoots him a look. "Mind your own business."

      Kretz returns his attention to the road. But
      something just isn't sitting right with him...


113   EXT. AIRFIELD - RASTENBURG - DAY                        113

      TITLES: 1:15 PM.

      Stauffenberg and Haeften climb aboard a waiting
      plane. A beat later it is rolling down the runway.

                          MERTZ (V.O.)
              Every second we stand here arguing
              is a second lost.


114   INT. WAR MINISTRY - OLBRICHT'S OFFICE - DAY             114

      Olbricht is calm - in full denial. He straightens his
      tie in the mirror as Mertz paces the room, flustered.

                            OLBRICHT
              I can't initiate Valkyrie without
              confirmation that Hitler's dead.
              It's too great a risk.

                                                       85.



                            MERTZ
             What about Stauffenberg? What about
             his risk? He did his part and now
             you're abandoning him.

                           OLBRICHT
             Watch yourself, Colonel.

                            MERTZ
             Shouldn't you be consulting Beck?

                           OLBRICHT
             I know just what Beck will say.
             He's a dying man. What does he have                     
             to lose?

      He puts on his hat and coat now, turning to leave.

                            MERTZ
             At least put the Reserve Army on
             alert.

                          OLBRICHT
             I can't cover up another false
             alarm. When Stauffenberg returns,
             when he gives me confirmation. Then                     
             we'll proceed.                                          

      Mertz is speechless. As Olbricht walks out:

                            MERTZ
             And where are you going?

                           OLBRICHT
             The same place you are. Lunch.


115   INT. KEITEL'S OFFICE - DAY                             115

      Keitel sits at his desk, listening intently to
      someone O.S. Although his wounds are superficial, he
      certainly took a beating in the blast.

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

                             ADAM
             The one-eyed Colonel...

                             KEITEL
             Stauffenberg.

                                                          86.



                             ADAM
             He left the building very abruptly -
             just before the explosion.

                            KEITEL
             Several men left the building
             before the explosion.

                             ADAM
             Yes, sir. Of course. But...

                            KEITEL
             But what? Spit it out, man.

                             ADAM
             Well. The Colonel left his hat.

      Keitel's expression sours. "Is that all you've got
      for me?" He is about to say so when that prick
      Freyend barges in, also banged up. With him is Kretz -
      Stauffenberg's driver.

                           FREYEND
             Pardon the intrusion, sir, but I
             think you will be most interested
             to hear what this man has to say.


116   INT. WAR MINISTRY - OLBRICHT'S OFFICE - DAY               116

      TITLES: 2:00 PM.

      Forty-five precious minutes have slipped away.

      Mertz sits alone at Olbricht's desk, lighting a fresh
      cigarette with the remains of another. The ashtray
      says he's been at this for quite a while. He stares
      at the clock, as if attempting to will time forward.

      His eyes sweep across Olbricht's desk, past his
      files, his stationery, framed photographs of his
      family. Then he looks up at a portrait of Hitler.

      Mertz is struck suddenly with a notion. He looks
      again at Olbricht's desk. His stationery...

      "Fuck it."

      He grabs the stationery and feeds it into a
      typewriter.

                                                        87.




117   INT. WAR MINISTRY - COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - DAY         117

      Mertz approaches a LOWLY TELECOMMUNICATIONS OPERATOR.
      Awkward pause. A struggle with the soul. Then he
      hands over a sheet of paper.

                            MERTZ
             Orders from General Olbricht.

      CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK...


118   INT. CENTRAL COMMUNICATIONS - BERLIN - DAY              118

      Again we are inside the nerve center of Nazi
      communications. Again the teletypes busily chatter
      away. And again, Sgt. Helm is curious, watching:

      STANDBY FOR OPERATION VALKYRIE...

      The TELETYPE OPERATOR looks up at Helm. "What do I
      do?" Helm glances over his shoulder to the uptight
      Lt. Haan - oblivious. Helm shrugs.

                             HELM
             Send it through. But keep me
             informed.

      A SHRILL WHISTLE takes us to...


      EXT. BERLIN - VARIOUS - DAY                                     

      Once again RESERVISTS and CADETS rush to their homes            
      and scramble to put on their uniforms.                          


119   EXT. DEUTSCHLAND GUARD BATTALION - DAY                  119

      The siren, the sculpted eagle and swastika, the                 
      pillared stronghold. Tanks and heavy equipment are              
      once again made ready.                                          

      General Hase issues the alert signal just as he did
      before, watching the men of the Reserve Army
      scramble. In the melee we find Lieutenant Hagen.

                            HAGEN
             Here we go again.

      He says this to:

                                                         88.



      Major Remer, the man who was so suspicious last time
      is even more suspicious now.                                     


121   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - CONFERENCE HUT - DAY                  121

      A light drizzle. A man jabbering in Italian O.S.

      We get our first good look at the demolished briefing
      hut. That anyone survived is a miracle. Officers
      crowd around the smoldering ruins, the Führer himself
      heading this procession. He wears new clothes,
      nodding, smiling politely to the jabbering Italian
      O.S. A slight wince is the only indication that he
      was damn near blown to bits just hours ago.

      COME AROUND TO REVEAL none other than BENITO
      MUSSOLINI speaking an incessant stream of Italian.

      HITLER'S P.O.V. Blissful silence. Mussolini's
      blathering falls literally on deaf ears.


122   EXT. AIRFIELD - RANGSDORF - DAY                          122

      TITLES: 3:15 PM.

      Three hours have passed since the explosion.
      Stauffenberg and Haeften alight from the plane. The
      airfield is surprisingly calm. No car to meet them.

                          STAUFFENBERG
              Quiet, isn't it?

      Too quiet.

                            HAEFTEN
              I'll see where our driver is.

      Haeften walks over to the office. Stauffenberg looks
      around the airfield. The silence slowly becomes
      unnerving. He goes after Haeften.


123   INT. AIRFIELD OFFICE - DAY                               123

      Stauffenberg enters just in time to hear:

                      HAEFTEN (INTO PHONE)
              You mean to tell me that the alert
              is only just going out-

      Stauffenberg swipes the phone from Haeften.

                                                       89.



                  STAUFFENBERG (INTO PHONE)
             This is Stauffenberg. Get me
             General Olbricht.


124   INT. WAR MINISTRY - OLBRICHT'S OFFICE - DAY            124

      Olbricht storms in, furious. He stands over Mertz,
      waving a document in his face - the very same
      document Mertz typed on Olbricht's stationery.

                             OLBRICHT
             Explain this.

                            MERTZ
             Someone had to do something while
             you were playing dead.

                           OLBRICHT
             We don't know that the Führer is
             not alive. We don't know any-

                            MERTZ
             THIS IS ABOUT GERMANY, FOR GOD'S
             SAKE. NOT YOU. BE A MAN.

      Before a fuming Olbricht can respond, the phone
      rings. Both men look at it - Olbricht is afraid to
      answer. Mertz shakes his head and picks up.

                        MERTZ (CONT'D)
             General Olbricht's office.

      He looks at Olbricht grimly, holding out the phone.

                        MERTZ (CONT'D)
             Stauffenberg for you, sir.

      Olbricht would rather take a live cobra than handle
      the phone right now. But take it he does.


125   INT. AIRFIELD OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                      125

      (Note: Intercut between Olbricht and Stauffenberg.)

                         STAUFFENBERG
             It's been three hours, Olbricht.                        
             What the hell have you been doing?                      

                           OLBRICHT
             We've had no confirmation that-                         

                                                 90.



                   STAUFFENBERG
       Dammit man, I saw the explosion                    
       myself. Nothing else matters now.
       We are committed.

Olbricht sits, color draining from his face. A real
"what have I done" moment.

                       OLBRICHT
       Dear God.

                   STAUFFENBERG
       Now where is Fromm? Is he with us
       or did you-

                     OLBRICHT
       I- No one has spoken to him yet.

Stauffenberg pounds his fist on the wall, furious -       
for the first and only time showing us a crack in his     
ultra-cool exterior. He collects himself and looks at     
his watch.

                   STAUFFENBERG
       Listen to me, Olbricht. Never mind
       Germany. Never mind Europe. Your
       life is at stake now, do you
       understand? If you want to live
       through the night you'll do exactly
       as I say.

                       OLBRICHT
       I understand.

                   STAUFFENBERG
       The second you hang up the phone,
       initiate Operation Valkyrie in
       Fromm's name. Then go over to his
       office in force, give him the
       choice to join us or place him
       under immediate arrest. Do I make
       myself perfectly clear?

                       OLBRICHT
       I understand.

                  STAUFFENBERG
       I am at the airfield now. I will be
       in Fromm's office in fifteen
       minutes. Be there when I arrive.                   

He slams the phone down, taking us to:                    

                                                       91.




126   INT. WAR MINISTRY - OLBRICHT'S OFFICE - DAY             126

      Silence. With shaking hands, Olbricht moves the
      portrait of Hitler, exposing a hidden wall safe from
      which he removes, at last, a thick folder marked:

      VALKYRIE

      He looks at Mertz.

                           OLBRICHT
             Get Beck and the others. Tell them                       
             it's time.

      Relieved, Mertz nods and rushes out. Olbricht picks
      up the phone and dials. After a beat, he reads from
      the first page of the Valkyrie order.

                      OLBRICHT (CONT'D)
             This is General Olbricht calling on
             behalf of General Fromm - Commander
             of the Home Army. Adolf Hitler, is                       
             dead. A group of radicals from the                       
             SS are attempting to seize control
             of the government. Operation
             Valkyrie is in effect. All military
             districts, training schools and
             replacement troops are to take
             control of essential government
             offices at once...

      CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK...


127   INT. CENTRAL COMMUNICATIONS - BERLIN - DAY              127

      Lt. Haans sits at his desk, sensing someone over his
      shoulder. He turns to find Sgt. Helm, a sheet of
      paper in his trembling hands.

                             HELM
             The Führer is dead.

      Skeptical, Haans snatches the paper from Helm. When
      he looks up, the entire staff is looking at him, some
      with tears in their eyes - others perhaps hiding a
      sense of relief.

      A phone rings. Then another. The chattering teletypes
      seem to surge into another gear as news of Hitler's
      death starts to spread.

                                                       92.



      Long pause. Haans struggles with the sheer size of
      the moment.

                            HAANS
             You all know your jobs. Get to
             work.

      Zombie-like, the Operators go back to their
      teletypes, passing orders along.

      But one Operator - the one Helm asked to keep him
      informed - notices something strange about one order            
      in a stack of many he is sifting through.                       

                           OPERATOR
             Sergeant. This order is signed by
             Witzleben.                                               

                             HELM
                       (taking the paper)
             That's ridiculous. He`s not even in
             the army anymore.

      But sure enough, there is Witzleben's name. Strange.
      Helm looks over at the devastated Haans, wondering
      how to handle this. Then, like a good little Nazi:

                        HELM (CONT'D)
             Pass the order along.


128   EXT. DEUTSCHLAND GUARD BATTALION - DAY                  128

      RESERVE SOLDIERS are marched into readiness. Vehicles
      moved into place. As they await further orders...

                         FROMM (V.O.)
             Who told you the Führer was dead?


129   INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S OFFICE - DAY                129

      Mertz and a sheepish Olbricht stand before Fromm. A
      stunned Lt. Herber hovers by the door.

                           OLBRICHT
             General Fellgiebel. At the Wolf's
             Lair.

      Fromm is at a loss for words. This just can't be so.
      He picks up the phone.

                                                         93.



                     FROMM (INTO PHONE)
             This is Fromm. Put me through to
             The Wolf's Lair.

                           OLBRICHT
             There's no use calling, all
             communication lines are-

                      FROMM (INTO PHONE)
             Yes. General Fromm for Field
             Marshal Keitel. Urgent.

      Mertz and Olbricht are shocked that he got through.              


130   INT. WOLF'S LAIR - KEITEL'S OFFICE - DAY                 130

      Keitel is still nursing a few wounds.

                       FROMM (ON PHONE)
             What's going on up there? The most
             incredible rumors are circulating
             in Berlin.

      Immediately suspicious, Keitel plays dumb, leading...

                            KEITEL
             I don't know what you mean.
             Everything's in order here.

      Keitel looks out the window at the still smoldering
      ruins of the conference hut in the distance.

                            FROMM
             There's talk the Führer's been
             assassinated.

                            KEITEL
             Another failed attempt. The Führer
             was never in danger.
                             (beat)
             By the way, where is your man
             Colonel Stauffenberg?


131   INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S OFFICE - DAY                 131

                            FROMM
             Stauffenberg? On his way back to
             Berlin, I should think.

      At the very mention of his name, Olbricht starts
      squirming.

                                                 94.



                KEITEL (ON PHONE)
       Let me know when he arrives. I'd
       like a word with him.

                       FROMM
       Certainly.

Click. After a beat, Fromm hangs up, smug.

                  FROMM (CONT'D)
       A false alarm. The Führer is fine.

Herber's outward relief stands in sharp contrast to
Olbricht's barely contained dread. Then:

                   VOICE (O.S.)
       That's a lie.

All eyes turn to see Stauffenberg and Haeften appear
in the doorway. Mertz lets out a sigh of relief as
they push their way past Herber and march into the
room.

                   STAUFFENBERG
       Hitler is dead. Operation Valkyrie
       is in effect.

Fromm stands, pounding his fist on the desk.

                      FROMM
       OPERATION VAL- WHO GAVE THE ORDER?

                    STAUFFENBERG
       You did.

                      FROMM
       THIS IS NOTHING LESS THAN TREASON.

                   STAUFFENBERG
       Be that as it may, the Reserve Army
       is assuming control here in Berlin.
       We trust you'll join us.

                      FROMM
       Dammit, man. Do you realize what
       you've done? The Führer is a-

                   STAUFFENBERG
       I delivered the bomb myself. I saw
       the blast. He is dead.

Fromm is stunned on several levels. He slowly sits
back in his chair.

                                                       95.



      CLOSE ON: Lt. Herber, who sees Stauffenberg as the
      model Nazi, is more shocked by this than the news of
      Hitler's death.

                            FROMM
             This can't be happening. It's some
             kind of joke.

                         STAUFFENBERG
             Are you with us or not?

                            FROMM
             Colonel, if what you say is true
             you should shoot yourself at once.
                         (to the others)
             The rest of you are under arrest.

                         STAUFFENBERG
             No, General. You are.

      And with those words, Haeften and Mertz draw their
      pistols, training them on the confused Fromm. Herber
      is paralyzed - unsure of what to do.

                            FROMM                                    
             I don't know where you think this                       
             is going, but I suggest you men                         
             change into civilian clothes and                        
             find a place to hide.                                   

                         STAUFFENBERG
                          (to Haeften)
             Lock him upstairs in his private
             quarters. Make sure his phone lines
             are cut.


132   INT. WAR MINISTRY- HALLWAY - DAY                       132

      Stauffenberg, Mertz and Olbricht march with great
      purpose. They are joined by Beck, coming the other
      way, wearing a plain dark suit. It is moving to see
      the old man manage the long walk.

                         STAUFFENBERG
             You're not in uniform.

                             BECK
             This has to be seen as a movement
             of the people.                                          

      Then he takes Stauffenberg's arm, letting Mertz and            
      Olbricht walk on, lowering his voice.                          

                                                       96.



                        BECK (CONT'D)                                 
             You're certain he's dead.                                

      Certain? Stauffenberg can see the private fear in               
      beck's eyes. But before he can answer, he is                    
      interrupted by a gasp O.S. as Olbricht opens the door           
      to his office, stepping back in shock. The others
      turn to see what it is...


133   INT. WAR MINISTRY - OLBRICHT'S OFFICE - DAY             133

      Looking out at the shocked faces of Olbricht, Mertz,
      Beck and Stauffenberg. PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

      Olbricht's office is packed to the four walls with
      GERMAN OFFICERS - all of them standing in silence,
      looking at the leaders of the Resistance with great
      respect. Stauffenberg walks in and the crowd parts,
      solemn and silent, nodding and whispering thanks.

      A YOUNG OFFICER steps forward. He looks hauntingly
      like the Lieutenant who drove Stauffenberg in Africa.

                        YOUNG OFFICER
             Colonel Stauffenberg, sir. We're
             reporting for duty.

      Stauffenberg is moved beyond words. Suddenly, what
      was once a small clutch of discarded generals and
      politicians is now a movement of motivated men.
      Stauffenberg nods, collects himself. In the crowd he
      finds Helldorf, the head of the Berlin Police, whom
      we met earlier. At first he speaks quietly, humbled.

                        STAUFFENBERG
                         (shaking hands)
             Helldorf, I'm... glad to see you.
             We're getting a late start and we
             need all of the manpower we can
             muster. Can we count on the police?                      

                          HELLDORF
             There's a lot of talk that Hitler                        
             isn't really dead. Is this true?                         

      Awkward pause. Good question. The men in the room               
      share nervous glances. Then all eyes on Stauffenberg.           

                         STAUFFENBERG
             I can't offer you any guarantees.                        
             The decision is yours and yours
             alone. Can we count on you?

                                                         97.



      Long pause. PAN ACROSS the uneasy faces of the men in
      the room, perhaps all of them waiting to see what
      Helldorf does before making their decisions. Finally:

                             HELLDORF
             I'm with you.

      Stauffenberg can barely hide his relief. There is a
      palpable shift in the room. One by one, the officers
      in the room reaffirm their commitment to the coup.

                         STAUFFENBERG
             Have your men surround the
             building. No one gets in or out of                        
             here without my permission.                               
                         (to the others)
             I want every available soldier on
             task - we need simultaneous control
             of every government building in the
             city. Dismissed.

      The soldiers move, but Beck's voice stops them -
      surprisingly loud and clear for a sick old man.

                             BECK
             Acts of vengeance will not be
             tolerated. We represent a different
             form of government. We represent
             what is good and just in Germany.                         

      AN EXPLOSION OF ACTIVITY:                                        


135   INT. WAR MINISTRY - STAUFFENBERG'S OFFICE - DAY          135

      Stauffenberg stands at his cluttered desk, a flurry
      of activity surrounding him. He is frantically
      speaking into the phone and to those present.

                        STAUFFENBERG
             ...Deploy troops to seize and
             protect all Reich agencies. Of most
             importance are communication
             centers - newspapers, radio
             stations, telephone and telegraph
             offices. All Nazi officials and
             government leaders are to be
             arrested at once...                                       

                                                         98.




136   INT. MILITARY COMMANDANT'S OFFICE - BERLIN - DAY         136

      General Hase, the Berlin Commandant, stands before a             
      giant map of Berlin, addressing a roomful of NAZI
      OFFICERS.

                             HASE
             ... Completely blockade the                               
             government quarters. Everything
             from the Brandenburg Gate to
             Potsdamer Platz. Nobody, not even
             generals or ministers, should be
             allowed to pass.
                              (beat)
             You have your orders, gentlemen.

      Again, we focus on Major Remer, Commander of the
      Deutschland Guard Battalion and always suspicious.

                        HASE (CONT'D)
             Is there a problem, Major?

                            REMER
             It just all seems very... vague,
             sir. Protocol dictates we should
             receive orders in writing-

                            HASE
             These are the orders as they were
             presented to me, Major. Now move.

      Pause. Just before the pause becomes insolent, Remer
      clicks his heels and salutes, leaving. But the look
      on his face tells us he's hatching a plan of his own.

      You are right to be nervous.


137   EXT. GOVERNMENT QUARTERS - BERLIN - VARIOUS - LATER      137

      The city center is abuzz with soldiers and military
      vehicles as they frantically cordon off the streets.

      SOLDIERS come out of various government buildings
      with SEVERAL NAZI GENERALS in custody, hands bound.
      They push them into waiting trucks.

      Meanwhile, PASSING CIVILIANS walk quickly by, trying
      to pretend they don't see anything. Years of Nazi
      rule have told them to mind their own business.

                                                          99.



      ANGLE ON: A staff car - Major Remer in the back,
      watching the entire scene with cold eyes. Lt. Hagen
      emerges from the chaos on the streets.

                            HAGEN
             Major Remer. We've just had orders
             from the War Ministry. The
             battalion is to blockade the
             government quarter and place
             Minister Goebbels under arrest.

      Remer does not move. He just thinks.

                        HAGEN (CONT'D)
             What is it, Major?

                            REMER
             Something just doesn't feel right
             about this. I would hate to find
             out I'm being taken advantage of.

                             HAGEN
                           (realizing)
             A coup you think?

                            REMER
             Of that I am certain. What I can't
             say is which side we're on. Get in.

      As Hagen does, Remer turns to his DRIVER.

                        REMER (CONT'D)
             Take us to the Reichministry. Be
             quick about it.                                            


140   INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S OFFICE - DAY                  140

      Stauffenberg, Beck and Olbricht lead a continued
      effort to manage the coup. Each man shouts orders
      into the phone, all the while signing dispatches sent
      by a steady flow of RUNNERS.                                      

      FRAULEIN VON OVEN (the secretary who worked with                  
      Stauffenberg and Tresckow to compile the Valkyrie
      orders) rushes in, whispering to Stauffenberg.                    

                        STAUFFENBERG                                    
             Send him in.
                        (Oven hesitates)
             It's all right. Send him in.

                                                100.



She opens the door and motions to someone outside.
After a beat, the door is filled with an almost
classic looking Nazi - A FAT GENERAL bristling with
medals. He enters the room, confused when he sees
Olbricht at Fromm's desk.

                   FAT GENERAL
       Begging your pardon, but I have
       orders to report to General Fromm.

                     OLBRICHT
       General Fromm is no longer in
       command. I am.

                    FAT GENERAL
       I...
                    (seeing Beck)
       Beck? What are you- What is going
       on here?

                   STAUFFENBERG
       The Führer is dead. The SS is
       staging a coup. We've initiated
       Operation Valkyrie to crush the
       uprising and save Hitler's Germany.

The Fat General assesses the scene with suspicion.

                   FAT GENERAL
       I'd say there is a coup all right,
       but it's not the SS.

Olbricht offers a sheet of paper.

                     OLBRICHT
       You will present these orders to
       your troops.

                   FAT GENERAL
       I will do no such thing without
       speaking to General Fromm. I swore
       an oath-

                   STAUFFENBERG                           
       You have your orders. Join us or                   
       face the consequences.

Stauffenberg and Olbricht take an imposing step in
the Fat General's direction. He carefully backs away.

                                                        101.



                          FAT GENERAL
             This is treason. I won't take part.
             The Führer is not dead. THE FÜHRER
             IS NOT DEAD.

      The Fat General makes a break for it. The
      conspirators chase him out into...


141   INT. WAR MINISTRY - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                 141

      The Fat General pushes past ONLOOKING OFFICERS.

                           OLBRICHT
             STOP THAT MAN.

      But they just watch the commotion, stunned. A ranking
      general being chased like a common criminal. Surreal.

      Haeften and Mertz appear at the other end of the hall
      - pistols raised, blocking the General's path. With
      Stauffenberg and Olbricht they overpower the Fat
      General who screams wildly to the amazement of the
      gawking officers.

                         FAT GENERAL
             THE FÜHRER IS NOT DEAD. I'VE SWORN
             AN OATH. YOU ALL HAVE...

      When they have him under control, Stauffenberg turns
      to the onlookers. He finds a familiar face in the
      crowd. A face he can trust. He finds:

                         STAUFFENBERG
             Lt. Herber. Come here.

      ANGLE ON: Lt. Herber. "Who, me?" He reluctantly steps
      forward.

                    STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
             Lock him up with Fromm.

      Herber hesitantly takes hold of the General, but the             
      act of taking a General into custody is a strange                
      one. Herber is clearly conflicted.                               


142   EXT. REICHMINISTRY - DAY                                 142

      Est. Remer arrives, followed by a wave of trucks.
      Soldiers deploy, surrounding the building.

                                                      102.




143   INT. REICHMINISTRY - GOEBBELS' OFFICE - DAY             143

      Propaganda Minister Goebbels - the most ghoulish of
      Hitler's Big Six. His spooky, deep-set eyes watch the
      action on the street below. Already he can hear
      troops coming down the hallway. He takes a pistol
      from his desk drawer and leaves it within reach. Then
      he picks up the phone and dials. After a beat.

                           GOEBBELS
             I am ready to be connected.

      The sound of footsteps outside his door. It bursts
      open. Remer enters, followed by ARMED SOLDIERS.

                      GOEBBELS (CONT'D)
             What can I do for you, Major?

                            REMER
             Minister Goebbels, my battalion has
             an order to blockade the government
             quarter and place you under arrest.

      Remer sees the pistol on Goebbels desk. But Goebbels
      makes no attempt to grab for it. Instead:

                           GOEBBELS
             Are you a dedicated Nazi, Major?

      Remer is caught off guard.

                             REMER
             Yes, sir.

      With that Goebbels turns his attention to the phone
      in his hand. We hear a faint voice: "Hello?"

      With an eerie smile, Goebbels simply extends his arm,
      offering the phone to a confused Remer. Silence as
      the Major takes it, holding it to his ear...

                         REMER (CONT'D)
             Hello?

                       VOICE (ON PHONE)
             Do you recognize my voice?

      Remer is in awe, for a moment unable to speak. Then:

                            REMER
             Of course, Mein Führer.

                                                      103.



                      HITLER (ON PHONE)
             Then listen to me very carefully...


144   INT. CENTRAL COMMUNICATIONS - BERLIN - DAY              144

      The communications staff busily connects calls and
      transmits orders. Sgt. Helm gingerly approaches Lt.
      Haans with two sheets of paper.

                            HAANS
             What is it now, Sergeant?

                             HELM
             It's just that now we're getting
             conflicting orders, sir. The Wolf's
             Lair says one thing, Stauffenberg
             another.

      Haans sighs, genuinely irritated now.

                            HAANS
             Our job is not to interpret the
             orders. Our job is to pass them
             along. Regardless.

                              HELM
             Yes, but sir-

                            HAANS
             Is that perfectly clear, Sergeant?

      Haans thrusts the orders back at Helm who sheepishly
      walks back to his pool of radio operators.


145   EXT. REICHMINISTRY - DUSK                               145

      As day turns to night, the soldiers surrounding the
      government quarters wait for further orders.

      Major Remer comes out a new man - invigorated and
      focused. He walks over to a truck loaded with RANKING
      PRISONERS, turning to the soldiers guarding them.

                             REMER
                         (re: prisoners)                              
             Release these men at once.                               

                            HAGEN
             But these men are part of a coup.                        

                                                      104.



                            REMER
             I've just been on the phone with
             Hitler himself. We are the coup,
             you idiot. We've been duped.


146   INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S QUARTERS - NIGHT            146

      Fromm is a prisoner in his own quarters - staring at
      a portrait of Hitler with equal parts disdain and
      reverence. The door suddenly opens.

      Herber enters, leading the handcuffed Fat General.
      Avoiding Fromm's gaze, he removes the restraints and
      turns to leave. But the wily Fromm can see the look
      in Herber's eyes.

                             FROMM
             Well, Lieutenant. What do you make
             of all of this?

      Herber freezes. Beat.

                            HERBER
             I... I don't know...                                     

                            FROMM
             I won't ask you to make a choice.
             That's for you and you alone. All I
             ask is that you observe and think
             for yourself. In time you'll see
             things for what they truly are. You
             know where to find me when you do.

      Herber nods hesitantly, then turns to leave, but:

                        FROMM (CONT'D)
             Lieutenant.
                     (as Herber turns back)
             Heil Hitler.

      Herber raises his right arm, just managing:

                              HERBER
             Heil Hitler.


147   INT. REICHMINISTRY - GOEBBELS' OFFICE - NIGHT           147

      Goebbels' office is now the scene of great activity.
      Soldiers rush in and out carrying orders. Goebbels is
      on two phones at the same time.

                                                      105.



      Through the melee comes none other than Heinrich
      Himmler - the bespectacled villain whose appearance
      is unmatched in fiction. His arrival cannot be good.

                           GOEBBELS
             Have you seen the Führer? Is he-

                           HIMMLER
             It seems the conference table
             shielded him from the blast. He's
             lucky to be alive.
                        (looking around)
             Do you want to tell me what's going
             on?

                           GOEBBELS
             Everything is under control. I've
             taken charge of the Guard Battalion
             and given them new orders. We're
             turning the tables on these
             cowards.

                           HIMMLER
             I've been sent here personally by
             the Führer to collect the
             conspirators. He insists they be
             taken alive.

      Goebbels and Himmler, two of the most evil men who
      ever lived, smile coldly. Being taken alive by this
      mob is obviously a fate worse than death.

      Goebbels turns to a nearby AIDE.

                           GOEBBELS
             Take this down. By order of Adolf
             Hitler...

      CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK...


148   INT. CENTRAL COMMUNICATIONS - BERLIN - NIGHT           148

      Once again the operators are frozen, looking at Lt.
      Haans. He in turn looks at two orders in his hands.
      He is deeply confused. Sgt. Helm is not.

                             HELM
             It's a coup all right... And when
             it's over, we'd better wind up on
             the right side. Now we can't afford
             to remain neutral any longer. We
             have to make a decision.

                                                      106.



      CLOSE ON: Haans. All eyes watch him weigh the
      decision of his life, of many lives. Millions in
      fact. Finally he relents, handing one paper to Helm.

                            HAANS
             Very well. Send all communications
             from the Wolf's Lair. Stop all
             communications from Stauffenberg.

      The operators spring into action.

      CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK...

                   RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
             Today an attempt was made on the
             Führer's life...


149   INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S OFFICE - NIGHT             149   

      Stauffenberg works frantically in a room full of
      officers - the energy here being the antithesis of
      Goebbels' office - the morale quickly waning.

      He ignores the radio, writing orders, making phone
      calls, fighting to keep the coup alive. But we know
      now his orders are hitting a dead end.

                       RADIO ANNOUNCER
             ...The Führer himself suffered no
             major injuries and resumed his work
             immediately...

      Stauffenberg turns off the radio, grabbing Haeften
      just as he is coming in.

                         STAUFFENBERG
             Send the following teleprint to all
             Army Commanders... `Broadcast
             communique not correct. The Führer
             is dead. Orders to be carried out
             with utmost dispatch.'

      Haeften nods and leaves. Stauffenberg turns back to
      his work, coming face to face with a deeply troubled
      Beck. Stauffenberg whispers, frustrated...                  

                    STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
             I saw the blast...                                   

                         VOICE (O.S.)
             What the hell kind of coup is this?

                                                   107.



All eyes turn to find Witzleben. Hours ago he was a
civilian, now he is a pompous, know-it-all General.

                     WITZLEBEN
       The military districts are
       receiving contradictory reports.
       I've got men sitting around joking
       about whose turn it is to arrest
       whom. Neither the capital nor the
       radio network are under our
       control. And where are the troops?
       You'd think there would be some
       activity going on in this city.
                  (to Stauffenberg)
       The word is all over the street
       that Hitler is still alive. We
       trusted you and you failed us. You                   
       should have stayed. To be sure.                      

                 OLBRICHT (O.S.)
       And who would have led the men here                  
       in Berlin? You?                                      

Finding his balls, Olbricht confronts Witzleben.

                OLBRICHT (CONT'D)
       The Colonel did more than any man                    
       could have hoped. If anyone is to                    
       blame it's-                                          

                   STAUFFENBERG                             
       Field Marshal Witzleben is right. I                  
       am the officer in charge. I am the                   
       man responsible. No one else.                        

Olbricht is moved and rightly so. Meanwhile:                

                    WITZLEBEN
       I'm going home to await my                           
       inevitable arrest.                                   

Witzleben turns, marching out. The room remains ill         
at ease, everyone having just witnessed a serious
blow to the Resistance. Those anonymous soldiers
present exchange glances of concern.                        

                    OLBRICHT                                
       I'm sorry, Colonel.                                  

After a beat, Olbricht turns and leaves.

CLOSE ON LIEUTENANT HERBER, tucked away in a corner
of the office.

                                                         108.


      He looks at Stauffenberg in a new light now,
      something darker - no longer the admirer. He shares a
      look with TWO OTHER OFFICERS. A wordless
      understanding. He leaves and they follow.


150   INT. WAR MINISTRY - HALLWAY - NIGHT                       150

      Herber and company march down the hallway in silence.
      They stop for Herber to unlock the door to...


151   INT. WAR MINISTRY - MUNITIONS STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT        151

      The officers file in, making a beeline for a locker
      in the corner of the room. Inside are all manner of
      sub-machine guns, pistols, grenades...

                            HERBER
             Arm yourselves.


152   EXT. WAR MINISTRY - NIGHT                                 152

      Under Remer's direction the Deutschland Guard
      Battalion quickly surrounds the War Ministry.

      We see a figure moving behind the windows up above...


153   INT. WAR MINISTRY - OLBRICHT'S OFFICE - NIGHT             153

      Olbricht helplessly watches troops surround the
      building below. It is only a matter of time now.

      He sits at his desk. With a long trembling sigh, he
      puts pen to paper and writes:

      "My dearest wife..."

      A commotion from the anteroom startles Olbricht and
      he drops the pen. A loud, shrill scream follows.

      The door bursts open to reveal Herber and his TWO
      COHORTS. They are supported by A HALF DOZEN ARMED
      SOLDIERS, all training their weapons on Olbricht.                 

      In the anteroom behind the soldiers we see Fraulein
      Oven quietly slipping out into the hallway.

                                                         109.




154   INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S OFFICE - NIGHT                154

      Beck, Stauffenberg and Haeften are still making calls
      and writing orders - doing all they can to keep the
      coup alive. They are startled when Fraulein Oven
      bursts in. It is written on her face.


155   INT. WAR MINISTRY - HALLWAY - NIGHT                       155

      Stauffenberg and Haeften rush toward Olbricht's
      office, stopping when they see a MASS OF SOLDIERS
      surrounding the doorway. A chill runs down our spines
      when we see Herber talking to none other than Major
      Remer. Just then, he spots Stauffenberg and Haeften.

                              REMER
             YOU THERE.

      Stauffenberg and Haeften turn and run.

                          REMER (CONT'D)
             HALT.

      BANG. A shot is fired. Stauffenberg and Haeften take
      cover in a nearby doorway. Haeften returns fire.
      Stauffenberg clamps his pistol under the stump of his
      right arm, managing to cock it with the three fingers
      of his left hand. Awkward. Then he aims and fires.                

      Stauffenberg takes a bullet in the shoulder of his
      good arm. He drops his gun, bleeding badly.                       

      But MORE SOLDIERS appear at the opposite end of the
      corridor. The loyal Haeften covers Stauffenberg with              
      his body, aiming to fire. But Stauffenberg stops him,             
      shaking his head. It's over. They toss down their                 
      guns. Boot-steps approach loudly O.S.                             

      As Stauffenberg looks down at the cross and ring                  
      around his neck:                                                  

                           HAEFTEN                                      
             Thank you, Colonel.                                        

      Stauffenberg is genuinely confused. "For what?"                   

                       HAEFTEN (CONT'D)                                 
             Better I die for Germany than for                          
             Hitler.                                                    

                                                         110.



                         VOICE (O.S.)
             Colonel Stauffenberg.

      Stauffenberg turns to find Remer standing there.                  

                            REMER
             You're under arrest.                                       


160   INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S OFFICE - LATER                160

      Stauffenberg, Olbricht, Beck, Mertz and Haeften, the
      last of the conspiracy, are held at gunpoint. A smug
      Fromm enters, followed by Herber, the Fat General,
      Remer and numerous GUN-TOTING OFFICERS.                           

                            FROMM                                       
             If you have any last messages,                             
             you'd better write them now.                               

                         STAUFFENBERG                                   
             My actions speak for me.                                   
                          (to his men)                                  
             I'd rather my wife and children                            
             remember our last time together.                           

      The others bravely nod in agreement. But then:                    

                             BECK
             I'd like a pistol, please.

      Stauffenberg looks at Beck with surprise.

                        BECK (CONT'D)
             For personal reasons.

      Fromm thinks about it, then matter-of-factly hands
      Beck a pistol. Remer quickly steps forward.

                            REMER
             General, my orders are to deliver
             the prisoners alive.

                             FROMM
             Noted, Major.
                            (to Beck)
             Get on with it then.

                             REMER
             But, sir-

                            FROMM
             THAT WILL BE ALL, MAJOR.

                                                  111.



Fromm glares at Remer who angrily backs down. Then he
turns to Beck and with a casual wave of the hand:

                    FROMM (CONT'D)
        Continue.

The moment is surreal. Beck, seated at the desk,
looks at each of his fellow conspirators. A look of
thanks, goodbye. With a badly trembling hand he
places the gun to his temple.

                        BECK
        I'm thinking of earlier times...

CLOSE ON: The conspirators turn away, unable to            
watch. Except Stauffenberg.                                

BANG.                                                      

And as if none of the last minute has even occurred,       
Fromm turns to the other conspirators.

                        FROMM                              
        Very well then... A court martial,
        convened by me in the Führer's
        absence, has pronounced sentence:
        Colonel Mertz von Quernheim,
        General Olbricht, Lieutenant
        Haeften...
               (glaring at Stauffenberg)
        And the Colonel, whose name I will
        not mention, are condemned to
        death.
                      (to his men)
        Take them outside.

Remer is clearly upset by this. Herber, on the other
hand, seems clearer than ever. He nods to his men who
drag the conspirators out. Herber personally takes
Stauffenberg by the arm. The two men share a look.
Nothing needs to be said. Each has found his place.

Stauffenberg turns to confront Fromm. He is weak,
white from fatigue and loss of blood.                      

                    STAUFFENBERG                           
        The Führer will want to put us on                  
        trial, make an example of us. This                 
        won't win you any favor. And it                    
        won't hide you're involvement.                     

                       FROMM                               
        Involvement. I don't know what you-                

                                                   112.



                   STAUFFENBERG                             
       You knew and you did nothing.                        
       You're just as guilty as we are.                     
       Even more so.                                        

                      FROMM                                 
       Spare me, Stauffenberg.                              

And those words bring a genuine smile to                    
Stauffenberg's face. He almost pities Fromm now.            

                   STAUFFENBERG                             
       No one will be spared.                               

And as Fromm motions for Herber to take Stauffenberg        
away, we hear music, faintly at first - accompanied         
by the subtle hiss and crackles of a phonograph... It       
is the piece Stauffenberg and Nina were dancing to          
one night long ago... Over this:                            

A voice. A man speaking in German - faint at first,         
crackling over the radio.                                   

                  HITLER (V.O.)                             
       My comrades. Once again - I don't                    
       know how many times it has been now                  
       - an attempt has been made on my                     
       life.                                                


INT./EXT. BERLIN - VARIOUS - NIGHT                          

A series of images of the coup being reversed as the        
Nazis take back power, made all the more poignant by        
the lonely sound of the phonograph, the music slowly        
rising, growing clearer and eventually becoming score       
over the silent images of:                                  

Conspirators being rounded up and arrested. Among           
them are faces we recognize...                              

Goerdeler, dragged from a hotel bed by SS OFFICERS as       
his informing INNKEEPER watches from the doorway.

161   EXT. WAR MINISTRY - NIGHT                                 161   

      Military vehicles are hastily arranged in a semi-              
      circle - headlamps marking the scene in stark white
      light and long black shadows.

      Stauffenberg, Haeften, Olbricht and Mertz are marched          
      into the courtyard, squinting in the harsh light as            
      they are placed against the wall of the War Ministry.          

                        HITLER (V.O.)                                
             I speak to you tonight for two                          
             reasons. First, so that you can                         
             hear my voice and know that I am                        
             unhurt. And second, so that you may                     
             know the details of a crime without

      TEN SOLDIERS of the Deutschland Guard Battalion                
      scramble to form a line opposite Stauffenberg and his          
      conspirators. We can clearly read Fromm's lips,                
      shouting: "MAKE READY..."                                      

      Stauffenberg and Haeften share a reassuring smile.             

      Remer watches bitterly from the shadows, focusing his
      hatred not on the conspirators... but on Fromm.

              for a few bruises and burns, I was                        
              completely untouched.                                     

      Fromm raises his arm, his lips reading: "TAKE AIM..."             

      TITLES: GENERAL FRIEDRICH FROMM - TRIED, 7 MARCH
      1945. EXECUTED, 12 MARCH 1945.

      Stauffenberg takes a breath and shouts defiantly, his             
      lips reading: "Long live sacred German-"                          

      Fromm drops his hand. Ten rifles open fire.                       

      CRANE UP and away as the music swells, as what is                 
      left of Berlin comes into view, as the few lights                 
      that remain suddenly go out as if a dark shadow were              
      passing over the land.                                            

                     HITLER (V.O.) (CONT'D)                             
              I see in this the hand of                                 
              Providence... directing me to                             
              complete my work.                                         

      And the last strains   of music resolve in a single,              
      sustained note as we   CRANE UP FURTHER, looking at               
      last to the overcast   darkness of the night sky. The             
      last note goes on as   if it might play forever...                

      Until suddenly it dips and we realize we are no                   
      longer hearing music at all, but the urgent wailing               
      of an air-raid siren - the warning of allied bombers              
      coming to deliver their nightly assault on Berlin.                

      Hitler's gift to Germany.

               INT. FIRST FUNERAL PARLOR - DAY

               A working-class funeral in progress. THIRTY PEOPLE and an 
               inexpensive bier SEEN from the back of the hall.

               ANGLE

               A MAN's back FILLS the SCREEN. He is dressed in a black suit; 
               his hands are clasped behind him. ANOTHER MAN stands next to 
               him. The Second Man reaches behind the First Man's back and 
               puts a discreetly folded ten-dollar bill into his hands.

               ANGLE

               These Two Men from the front. Both somber, in their early 
               fifties. They begin to walk down the aisle of the funeral 
               parlor.

               ANGLE

               The WIDOW. A woman in her late fifties sitting by the bier 
               receiving condolences. The Two Men approach her. The First 
               Man (the recipient of the money) speaks:

                                     FUNERAL DIRECTOR
                         Mrs. Dee, this is Frank Galvin -- a 
                         very good friend of ours, and a very 
                         fine attorney.

                                     GALVIN
                         It's a shame about your husband, 
                         Mrs. Dee.

               The Widow nods.

                                     GALVIN
                         I knew him vaguely through the Lodge. 
                         He was a wonderful man.
                              (shakes head in 
                              sympathy)
                         It was a crime what happened to him. 
                         A crime. If there's anything that I 
                         could do to help...

               GALVIN removes a business card from his jacket pocket and 
               hands it to her as if he were giving her money. (i.e., "Take 
               it. Really. I want you to have it..." She takes the card.

               Beat.

                                     GALVIN
                              (thoughtfully realizes 
                              he is usurping her 
                              time)
                         Well... 

               He shakes her hand and moves on.

               INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

               Galvin sitting in the deserted coffee shop in his raincoat.

               Reading a section of the paper. He picks up his teacup, 
               drinks. Lowers it to the table.

               ANGLE - INSERT

               Galvin twists tea bag around a spoon to extract last drops 
               of tea. His hand moves to his felt pen lying on the table.

               He moves his hand to the paper, open at the obituary section.

               We SEE several names crossed out. He circles one funeral 
               listing.

               ANGLE

               Galvin sitting, raises cup of tea to his lips. Looks around 
               deserted coffee shop. Sighs.

               INT. SECOND FUNERAL HOME AND STREET - AFTERNOON

               Galvin outside a second funeral home. WORKING-CLASS PEOPLE 
               entering, Galvin enters the home.

               ANGLE

               Galvin, coming down the aisle toward the front, shrugging 
               himself out of his overcoat, he approaches the BEREAVED WIDOW 
               sitting by the front of the home, he extracts his card from 
               his pocket, starts to speak. He is stopped by the WIDOW'S 
               SON, a hefty man in his mid-forties, who interjects himself 
               between Galvin and the widow.

                                     SON
                              (of the card)
                         What is that...?

                                     GALVIN
                         I...

                                     SON
                         What the hell is that...

                                     GALVIN
                         ...I was a friend of your fa...

                                     SON
                         You never knew my father.
                              (hits card out of 
                              Galvin's hand)
                         You get out of here, who the hell do 
                         you think you are...

               The FUNERAL MANAGER hurries down the aisle, and starts 
               extricating Galvin from the commotion.

                                     GALVIN
                              (to Funeral Manager)
                         I'm talking to this man...

                                     FUNERAL MANAGER
                         Excuse me, Mrs. Cleary...

               He is manhandling Galvin toward the back of the funeral 
               parlor. The Son calls after him:

                                     SON
                         Who the hell do you think you are?

               EXT. SECOND FUNERAL PARLOR - AFTERNOON

               The Funeral Manager and Galvin standing in the cold.

                                     FUNERAL MANAGER
                         I don't want you coming back here. 
                         Ever. Do you understand?

                                     GALVIN
                         I was just talking to...

                                     FUNERAL MANAGER
                         Those are bereaved people in there.

               The Funeral Manager gives Galvin a small shove, and goes 
               back to his post at the door, greeting the entering mourners.

               "Good evening..."

               ANGLE

               Galvin, the ground cut out from under him. Standing watching 
               the mourners enter.

               EXT. SECOND FUNERAL STREET - DUSK

               Galvin walking down a residential street. He has been walking 
               a while in the cold, snowy night. He stops for a stoplight 
               at a corner, waits for the light although there is no traffic.

               Lights a cigarette. The light changes. He looks both ways 
               and irresolutely starts across the street. He stops. He checks 
               his watch. He sighs, and starts back in the opposite 
               direction.

               INT. O'ROURKE'S BAR - NIGHT

               Galvin holding forth at the bar of a seedy drinking-man's 
               establishment, THREE DRINKERS, acquaintances, standing around 
               him, appreciative.

                                     GALVIN
                         Pat says, 'Mike... there's a new 
                         bar, you go in, for a half a buck 
                         you get a beer, a free lunch, and 
                         then take you in the back room and 
                         they get you laid.'

               The bartender, JIMMY, comes up to Galvin.

                                     JIMMY
                         Another, Frank...?

                                     GALVIN
                              (gestures to include 
                              group)
                         ...everybody. Mike says, 'Pat, you 
                         mean to tell me for a buck you get a 
                         free lunch and a beer, and then you 
                         go in the back and get laid?' 'That's 
                         correct.' Mike says, 'Pat. Have you 
                         been in this bar ?' Pat says, 'No, 
                         but my sister has...'
                              (gestures to Jimmy)
                         Everyone. Buy yourself one too.

               INT. GALVIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               The seedy, disorganized small office, Galvin in shirt-sleeves 
               opening a file cabinet. He takes out an armload of files, 
               carries them to a wastebasket and throws them in. He sits on 
               his desk, as if exhausted by his effort, pours from a whiskey 
               bottle into a large water glass, downs the glass.

               He has been drinking for some time. He starts stumbling back 
               to the file cabinet. On the way his eye is caught by his 
               degrees hanging on the wall. He stumbles to them, picks them 
               up and walks over to the wastebasket and throws them in. He 
               goes back to the file cabinet, the phone starts ringing. 
               Galvin lets it ring, continues emptying the files into the 
               wastebasket, tearing some of them up as he does so.

               He repeats softly to himself, as a litany, "It doesn't make 
               a bit of difference, it doesn't make a bit of difference..." 
               He starts back to the desk for the bottle, knocks the still-
               ringing phone off the desk. He pours himself a drink.

               As he downs it we hear -- softly -- from the phone on the 
               floor: a MAN'S VOICE. "Frank. Frank. Frank. Goddamnit. Are 
               you there...? Frank..." Galvin pays no attention.

               Drinks his drink and gazes at the wall -- now empty of 
               degrees.

               ANGLE - P.O.V.

               The empty wall. Galvin's P.O.V. The telephone heard Voice 
               Over insisting, "Frank..."

               INT. GALVIN'S OFFICE ANTEROOM - NIGHT

               MICKEY MORRISSEY, a man in his late sixties, dressed in suit 
               and overcoat, looking worried, unlocks the door to the dark 
               anteroom. Looks around. Sees something in the next room.

               ANGLE - P.O.V.

               Galvin asleep on his couch, clothed as before. Covered in 
               his overcoat, the bottle and glass next to the couch on the 
               floor, the sound of the phone off the hook.

               ANGLE

               Mickey walks into the office. Stands looking at Galvin.

                                     MICKEY
                              (harshly)
                         Get up.
                              (beat, more harshly)
                         Get up.

               Galvin wakes up. Looks around. Swings his legs over the couch. 
               Drinks from the glass. Vacantly:

                                     GALVIN
                         Hi, Mickey...

                                     MICKEY
                         What the hell do you think you're 
                         doing...?
                              (surveys the wrecked 
                              office)
                         What's going on here...?

                                     GALVIN
                         Uh...

                                     MICKEY
                         Fuck you. I got a call today from 
                         Sally Doneghy...

                                     GALVIN
                         ...now who is that...?

                                     MICKEY
                         ...You're 'sposed to be in court in 
                         ten days and she's telling me you 
                         haven't even met with them...

                                     GALVIN
                         Sally Doneghy, now who is that?

                                     MICKEY
                         One lousy letter eighteen months 
                         ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case 
                         your way...

                                     GALVIN
                         ...hey, I don't need your charity...

                                     MICKEY
                         ...I get these people to trust you -- 
                         they're coming here tomorrow by the 
                         way -- I get this expert doctor to 
                         talk to you. I'm doing all your 
                         fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen 
                         months. You're 'sposed to be in court. 
                         I bet you haven't even seen the file.

               Galvin pours himself a drink.

                                     GALVIN
                         Hey, what are you, my nanny?

               Mickey walks to him, knocks the drink out of his hand and 
               slaps him several times in the face.

                                     MICKEY
                         Listen to me. Listen to me... listen 
                         to me, Frank, 'cause I'm done fuckin' 
                         with you. I can't do it any more. 
                         Look around you: You think that you're 
                         going to change? What's going to 
                         change it? You think it's going to 
                         be different next month? It's going 
                         to be the same. And I have to stop. 
                         This is it. I got you a good case, 
                         it's a moneymaker. You do it right 
                         and it will take care of you. But 
                         I'm through. I'm sorry, Frank, this 
                         is the end.
                              (beat)
                         Life is too short, and I'm too old.
                              (beat)

               Mickey walks out of the office. Slams the door. Beat.

               Galvin looks around the office. Goes to his sofa. Sits, 
               reaches to side table.

               ANGLE - INSERT

               The side table, a pack of Luckies. Galvin taking one, his 
               hand shaking a little. Also on side table a pile of change 
               containing a small rosary and a wedding ring.

               INT. GALVIN'S OFFICE ANTEROOM - INSERT - DAY

               The carriage of a typewriter. A sheet of paper. Its letterhead 
               reads "Frank P. Galvin. Attorney at Law, 124 State Street, 
               Boston, Mass. 02981. Cable FRAGAL." Someone is typing, "Sorry 
               I had to go out. Back at 10. Judge Geary called. Are you 
               available for lunch Wednesday University Club?" A hand takes 
               a paper from carriage and puts it on desk. Takes a pen and 
               signs, "Claire."

               ANGLE

               Galvin in the anteroom, dressed in his suit, unshaved, having 
               just signed the paper. He takes a piece of Scotch tape from 
               the dispenser on the desk, picks up a file folder from the 
               coffee table. It is torn in several places and rudely Scotch-
               taped.

               ANGLE - P.O.V. - INSERT

               The file headed Deborah Ann Kaye v. St. Catherine Laboure 
               Hospital et. al.

               ANGLE

               Galvin surveys the anteroom, opens door to corridor, Scotch 
               tapes the note he has just typewritten to the outside of the 
               door.

               INT. O'ROURKE'S BAR - DAY

               Dark paneling, clean, simple. A drinkers' bar. OLD BARTENDER 
               and THREE CUSTOMERS spaced widely, Galvin in his overcoat 
               downing a shot, the file open before him. He is reading.

               He checks his watch, scoops the file together under his arm, 
               throws a dollar on the bar, and heads for the door.

               INT. NORTHERN NURSING HOME CORRIDOR - DAY

               Galvin walking tentatively down the corridor of a very rundown 
               nursing home. He receives suspicious looks from the 
               Attendants. He is checking numbers on the doors against a 
               notation in the file. He finds the correct door and enters.

               INT. NURSING HOME WARD - DAY

               The door to the ward from the inside. Galvin opening the 
               door to the dark ward, backlit, tentative, a little unsteadied 
               from his drinking. He puts his back against the door, puts 
               down file and briefcase, extracts a small cheap Polaroid 
               camera from the briefcase, readies it to shoot, picks up his 
               paraphernalia, and starts off down the ward. As he walks 
               down the ward he checks the file hung at the foot of each 
               bed. Galvin stops at the foot of one bed and reads the chart.

               ANGLE - P.O.V.

               The chart held by Galvin. DEBORAH ANN KAYE, various medical 
               notations. He lowers the chart and we SEE in the bed beyond 
               it a shriveled, tiny form stuck with needles and tubes.

               ANGLE

               Galvin replaces the chart, puts his file, briefcase, etc. on 
               the foot of the bed, takes a flash photo of the figure in 
               the bed. Takes another one. Puts down camera, sits on the 
               end of the bed gazing at the unseen form. He lights a 
               cigarette, and sits looking at her.

               INT. CORRIDOR - GALVIN'S OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

               SALLY DONEGHY. A mousy woman in her forties is standing by a 
               door on which is written, "Frank P. Galvin. Attorney at Law."

                                     GALVIN
                         I'm... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank 
                         Galvin... why didn't you go in?

                         It's locked.

                              (astonished)
                         It's locked?

               Sally Doneghy points to the note on the door. Galvin takes 
               it from the door. Reads. "Back at 10, Judge Geary. Lunch..."

                                     GALVIN
                         I'm terribly sorry... I hope we didn't 
                         put you out. Won't you come in...?
                              (motions Sally into 
                              inner office, gestures 
                              with note)
                         I'd offer you some coffee, but it 
                         looks like my girl just went out.

               INT. OFFICE ANTEROOM - DAY

               Galvin is perched at his secretary's desk. Sally Doneghy 
               across from him by the coffee table listening intently.

                                     GALVIN
                         It's not a good case. It's a very 
                         good case.

                                     GALVIN
                         A healthy young woman goes into the

                         she's given the wrong anesthetic...

                         But what can we do? She don't know 
                         who's visiting her...

                         Her husband left her, and he took 
                         her kids... They, they, they'd let 
                         you die in there. They don't care. 
                         Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the 
                         Chronic Care... in Arlington...? 
                         They'd take her in. Perpetual care. 
                         They'd take her. Fifty thousand 
                         dollars they want. An endowment.

                         My doctor told me that I got to move 
                         out West... that's when we filed in 
                         court. We didn't want to sue...

                         years in Tucson... and they called 
                         him up and said to come out. He's a 
                         good man. He's only trying to do 
                         what's right.

               The door to the corridor opens and DICK DONEGHY, a workingman 
               in his forties, comes into the room. Sally and Galvin stand.

                                     SALLY
                         This is my husband.

               Donegy and Galvin shake hands uncomfortably. He motions the 
               two to sit.

                                     GALVIN
                         Please sit down. I told your wife. 
                         I'm sorry that we have to meet out 
                         here. I've got a case coming in two 
                         days in the Superior Court and my 
                         office is a mess of papers.

                         I was telling your wife, we have a 
                         very good case here.

                         doctors, experts in the field... 
                         there is, of course, a problem getting 
                         a doctor to testify that another 
                         doctor's negligent...

                         ...the Archdiocese called up, they 
                         said who was our attorney, 'cause 
                         the case is coming to trial...

                         I doubt we'll have to go to trial...

                         ...we told them we didn't want it to 
                         come out this way.

                                     GALVIN
                         I completely understand...

                         We just can't do it anymore.
                              (beat)
                         This is our chance to get away.

                                     GALVIN
                         I'm going to see you get that chance.

                                     DONEGHY
                         What is this going to cost?

                                     GALVIN
                         It's completely done on a contingency 
                         basis. That means whatever the 
                         settlement is I retain one-third... 
                         that is, of course, the usual

                         Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey 
                         until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-
                         eight. Since then he's been on his 
                         own. Four cases before the Circuit 
                         Court. He lost them all. He drinks.

                                     BISHOP
                         Four cases in three years...

                                     ALITO
                         The man's an ambulance chaser...

                                     BISHOP
                         ...tell me about this case.

                                     ALITO
                         This is a nuisance suit. He's looking 
                         for small change. He's asking for 
                         six hundred thousand and betting we 
                         don't want to go to court.

                                     BISHOP
                         No -- we don't want this case in 
                         court.

                                     ALITO
                         Neither does he. That's where he 
                         loses. This man's scared to death to 
                         go to court. We only have to call 
                         his bluff.

                                     BISHOP
                         I want to settle this thing and be 
                         done with it. I don't want the 
                         Archdiocese exposed.

                                     ALITO
                         No. Absolutely, and we're going to 
                         see that it is not.

                                     BISHOP
                         So what I want to do is stop it here. 
                         I'm going to make him an offer. I 
                         want to do it myself. I want it to 
                         come from me.

                                     ALITO
                         All right. But let's keep the price 
                         down. I've called Ed Concannon. He 
                         recommends that we continue to respond 
                         as if we're going to trial.

               The Bishop nods, meaning, "You are dismissed." As an 
               afterthought:

                                     BISHOP
                         If we were to go to trial, would we 
                         win the case?

                                     ALITO
                         Well, of course, it's always 
                         dangerous...

                                     BISHOP
                         I know that answer. If we went to 
                         trial would we win?

                                     ALITO
                              (in an "of course" 
                              tone)
                         Yes.

               Alito, preparing to leave, reaches to the Bishop's desk, 
               where he has laid his leather folder.

               ANGLE

               The clipping in the folder, confused Galvin being led into 
               jail, "Boston Lawyer Held in Jury Tampering Case." Alito's 
               hand snaps the folder shut.

               INT. GALVIN'S OFFICE BUILDING CORRIDOR - DAY

               A man's arms full of textbooks. Prominently displayed:

               "Methodology and Practice in Anesthesiology." The man stops, 
               fumbles for a key in his pocket.

               ANGLE

               Galvin, in his overcoat, arms full of books, reading from a 
               textbook and trying to unlock his office door.

               INT. OFFICE

               Galvin entering. CLAIRE PAVONE, a woman in her fifties, at 
               the secretary's desk, hanging up the phone.

                                     CLAIRE
                              (to phone)
                         Thank you very much.

               Galvin looks up at her in surprise.

                                     GALVIN
                         What are you doing here?

                                     CLAIRE
                         Mickey told me to come back to work.

               Galvin nods, proceeds into his office, reading from the 
               textbook. Claire follows him into the office.

                                     CLAIRE
                         ...here's your mail, call Mrs. 
                         Doneghy...

                                     GALVIN
                         ...yes. Get her on the phone...

                                     CLAIRE
                         ...that was a Dr. David Gruber's 
                         office...

                                     GALVIN
                              (putting down books)
                         Gruber...

                                     CLAIRE
                         Mickey told him to call.
                              (reading from notes)
                         'He's some very hotshot surgeon at 
                         Mass. Commonwealth. He wants to meet 
                         with you at seven tonight re testimony 
                         in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye. You 
                         meet him at the hospital.'

               She hands him typed memo slip.

                                     GALVIN
                              (surprised)
                         ...he wants to testify...?

                                     CLAIRE
                         It looks that way.

                                     GALVIN
                         You know what that would mean?

                                     GALVIN
                         To get somebody from a Boston hospital 
                         to say he'll testify?

                                     CLAIRE
                         ...a Mrs. Doneghy called... I told 
                         you that.

               Phone rings. Claire moves to it.

                                     GALVIN
                              (delighted)
                         This is going to drive the ante up.

                                     CLAIRE
                              (into phone)
                         Frank Galvin's... who's calling 
                         please? Bishop Brophy's office...

               She gestures to Galvin, "Do you want to talk to them?" Galvin 
               gestures back, "No. I'm not in..."

                                     CLAIRE
                         I'm sorry, he's not in... may I take 
                         a mess... tomorrow when, two 
                         o'clock... I'll check my book...

               She looks to Galvin, who nods, "yes."

                                     CLAIRE
                         Yes. Mr. Galvin's clear at that 
                         time... the Bishop's office, tomorrow, 
                         the fifth at two p.m. Thank you...

               She hangs up.

                                     GALVIN
                         That's the call that I'm waiting 
                         for.

                                     CLAIRE
                         What does it mean?

                                     GALVIN
                         They want to settle.
                              (beat)
                         It means a lot of money.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Does that mean I'm back for awhile?

               INT. GRUBER'S HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - INSERT - NIGHT

               Man's wrist. WWII GI watch reads: 6:56.

               ANGLE

               Galvin in overcoat standing outside door marked "Doctors 
               Only" in bustling hospital corridor. He glances at memo slip 
               in his hand. He opens door. CAMERA FOLLOWS him onto:

               INT. GRUBER'S DOCTORS LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

               Carpeted, small, comfortable, lined in lockers. A DOCTOR, on 
               the phone in greens, smoking a cigarette, talking on the 
               phone softly, a couple of DOCTORS sitting, drinking coffee, 
               chatting. Galvin, a trifle nervous, to Doctor ON PHONE:

                                     GALVIN
                         Dr. Gruber...?

               The Doctor on the phone gestures behind him to a thirty-ish 
               MAN in blue jeans smoking a cigar, changing at his locker.

               Galvin walks over to him.

                                     GALVIN
                         Dr. Gruber...

                                     GRUBER
                              (turning)
                         Yes? Galvin, right?

               He checks his watch, continues changing into suede jacket, 
               checks next appointment on a leather appointment book, locks 
               the locker, pockets key.

                                     GALVIN
                         I appreciate -- a man as busy as --

                                     GRUBER
                         That's perfectly all right. I'm kind 
                         of rushed. Do you mind if we walk 
                         while we talk?

               Gruber, Galvin following, talk while exiting locker room.

               INT. GRUBER'S HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

                         I read the hospital report on your 
                         client.

                                     GALVIN

               They walk hurriedly through a hospital corridor, to an EXIT 
               door and down concrete stairs.

                         They called, they're going to settle, 
                         what I want to do is build up as 
                         much...

                                     GRUBER
                         Right. Who called?

                                     GALVIN
                         The Archdiocese called, they want to 
                         settle... her estate...

                                     GRUBER
                         ...and you're going to do that?

                                     GALVIN
                              (surprised, of course)
                         Yes.

                                     GRUBER
                         You're going to settle out of court?

               Gruber stops at the bottom of the stairs, beside an exit to 
               the outside.

                                     GALVIN
                         Yes.

                                     GRUBER
                         Why?

               A beat.

                                     GALVIN
                              (it's a meaningless 
                              question to him, as 
                              if to a child)
                         Uh... in the, well, in the interests 
                         of her family... you, Dr. Gruber, 
                         you know, you can never tell what a 
                         jury is going to do. St. Catherine's 
                         a very well thought of institution. 
                         Her doctors...

                         Her doctors murdered her. They gave 
                         her the wrong anesthetic and they 
                         put her in the hospital for life.

                         The most respected...

                                     GRUBER
                              (smiling)
                         Whose side are you arguing...? I 
                         thought that you wanted to do 
                         something. I don't have any interest 
                         in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, 
                         but we all know where the money's 
                         going to... I have an interest in 
                         the Hospital; and I don't want those 
                         bozos working in the same shop as 
                         me. They gave her the wrong 
                         anesthetic. They turned the girl 
                         into a vegetable. They killed her 
                         and they killed her kid. You caught 
                         'em. Now: how many others did they 
                         kill?

               A beat. Gruber discards end of a cigar. Takes a leather case 
               from his suede jacket, extracts a new cigar. Offers one to 
               Galvin.

                                     GRUBER
                         You want a cigar?

               Galvin takes one absently.

                                     GALVIN
                         The hospital is owned by the 
                         Archdioceses of...

                                     GRUBER
                         What are they going to do? Not invite 
                         me to their Birthday party...?
                              (checks watch)
                         Look, I gotta go. I have to be in 
                         Cambridge...

               Galvin, excited, is trying to light the cigar. His hand shakes 
               badly. He has forgotten to bite off the end. He bites it, 
               lights the cigar.

                                     GALVIN
                         Well, well, when can we meet again.

               I'd like to get a deposition..

                                     GRUBER
                         Okay. I'll meet you here. Tuesday 
                         night... I gotta go. You going my 
                         way?

               Galvin shakes his head.

               EXT. GRUBER'S HOSPITAL PARKING AREA - NIGHT

               Gruber opens door and walks out into the cold, into the 
               parking lot, followed by Galvin, who is lighting his cigar.

                                     GALVIN
                         We have to... we... we have to keep 
                         you under wraps. Please don't, don't 
                         discuss...

                                     GRUBER
                         I understand.

                                     GALVIN
                         ...the case with anyone. And I'll 
                         meet you Tuesday, and we'll go over 
                         your testimony...

               They stop before a 1950s very beautiful small Mercedes Sedan.

               Gruber opens the door, gets into the plush red leather 
               interior, starts car, leaves door open, still talking to 
               Galvin.

                                     GRUBER
                         Right. Seven o'clock. Here.

               Galvin scribbles information in his appointment book.

                                     GALVIN
                         Thank you...

                                     GRUBER
                         ...that's perfectly all right.

                                     GALVIN
                              (beat)
                         Uh, why, why are you doing this?

                                     GRUBER
                              (thinks a second)
                         To do right. Isn't that why you're 
                         doing it?

               INT. O'ROURKE'S TAVERN - NIGHT

               Galvin is at the bar, smiling to himself. His drink is being 
               refilled. To BARTENDER:

                                     GALVIN
                         I want to buy you a drink.

                                     JIMMY (THE BARTENDER)
                         Thanks, Franky.

               Galvin looks around. A very attractive self-possessed YOUNG 
               WOMAN is sitting in the crook of the bar across from him; 
               she is intently perusing the newspaper and circling items 
               with a felt pen. Galvin speaks to her:

                                     GALVIN
                         Would you like a drink?

               She looks up. Smiles.

                                     WOMAN
                         I'd like an apartment.

                                     GALVIN
                         Settle for a drink?

               She gestures at her own full glass in front of her.

                                     WOMAN
                         No. Thank you.

               Galvin shrugs.

                                     GALVIN
                         I had a very good day today.

                                     WOMAN
                              (beat, smiles, downs 
                              drink, gets up off 
                              the stool, sincerely)
                         I'm glad you did. Thank you. Good 
                         night.

                                     GALVIN
                         You're very welcome.

               He watches her as she leaves the bar. He turns back to his 
               drink.

                                     GALVIN
                         Well, well, well. Huh?

                                     JIMMY
                         Yeah.

                                     GALVIN
                              (sighs)
                         It's a long road that has no turning.

                                     JIMMY
                         That's for sure, Frank.

               INT. GALVIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               A shoddy one-and-a-half room bachelor apartment. Galvin, 
               beer and cigarettes on the table beside him. He is sitting 
               on an armchair in the bedroom. A yellow legal pad in his 
               lap.

               He is talking on the phone softly, soothingly.

                                     GALVIN
                         I'm going to the Archdiocese tomorrow 
                         at two. I know you don't. I know you 
                         don't... no, you're just following 
                         your life. You have a life too... 
                         you have to move out West. It doesn't 
                         help you to stay here. Well... I'm 
                         sure she knows you care for her.

               His attention wanders to the legal pad in his lap.

               ANGLE - P.O.V.

               The legal pad. Spread on it a couple of Polaroids of Deborah 
               Ann in the nursing home. Below them, written on the pad, 
               large, "Dr. David Gruber. Ass't. Chief Anesthesiology, Mass. 
               Commonwealth. 'They killed her. And they killed her kid -- 
               Her doctors murdered her.'"

               The following figures are written on the pad: $150,000.00 
               written very large, circled, crossed out. $250,000.00 
               similarly circled and crossed out. $225,000.00 circled many 
               times.

                                     GALVIN
                              (voice over; on phone)
                         Well. Well. Well. Finally we're none 
                         of us protected... we... we just 
                         have to go on. To seek help where we 
                         can... and go on... I know that you 
                         love her... I know you're acting out 
                         of love.

               ANGLE - GALVIN ON THE PHONE

                                     GALVIN
                              (into phone)
                         As soon as I know... you give him my 
                         respects too. Not at all. Not at 
                         all... Good night.
                              (beat)
                         Well, bless you, too. Good night.

               He hangs up phone, sighs. Lights a cigarette. Rotates his 
               neck to loosen it up. Reaches to the table next to his bed 
               for the bottle to pour a drink.

               ANGLE - INSERT

               His hand reaching for the bottle. On the table the photo of 
               a very beautiful blonde woman in a silver frame. She is the 
               same woman we saw earlier in the news clip. She is on the 
               deck of a sailboat, laughing. A pile of change on the table, 
               a money clip, a rosary, and the wedding ring in the pile of 
               change.

               ANGLE

               Galvin looking at the photo in the silver frame next to his 
               bed. He sighs deeply. Beat. Reaches up to the lamp above his 
               head and turns it off. He sits stiffly in the dark a moment, 
               then lets his head fall back to the chair.

               INT. NORTHERN NURSING HOME WARD - DAY

               Galvin, spruced up a bit, sitting on a bed, his briefcase on 
               his lap. Gazing at the unseen Deborah Ann Kaye in the dark 
               ward. Silent. Beat. He looks in his briefcase, takes out a 
               file.

               ANGLE - P.O.V. - INSERT

               The file, labeled Deborah Ann Kaye. Galvin extracting the 
               photo of the young mother romping with her two children; he 
               takes the yellow legal pad from his briefcase and puts it on 
               top of the picture (the figures crossed out; "Her doctors 
               murdered her," etc.).

               We hear the door to the ward open and TWO IRISH WOMEN 
               gossiping.

                                     IRISH NURSE #1 (V.O.)
                         Jimmy, I said, don't you go in your 
                         pocket if there's nothing there...

                                     IRISH NURSE #2 (V.O.)
                         ...and what did he say...?

                                     IRISH NURSE #1 (V.O.)
                              (spies Galvin, her 
                              tone changes)
                         ...Sir, you aren't allowed to be in 
                         here...

               ANGLE

               Galvin sitting on the bed looking at Deborah Ann. He looks 
               up to the speaker. A slovenly Irish Nurse, who has come into 
               the room and is standing by him. The other Nurse is framed 
               in the doorway. Galvin is lost in thought.

                                     NURSE
                         You can't be in here.

                                     GALVIN
                              (as if remembering 
                              something, simply)
                         I'm her attorney.

               INT. BISHOP BROPHY'S OFFICE - DAY

               The Bishop from the waist up, sitting behind his beautiful 
               desk. Compassionately:

                                     BISHOP
                         It's a question of continuing values. 
                         St. Catherine's -- to do the good 
                         that she must do in the community 
                         has to maintain the position that 
                         she holds in the community. So we 
                         have a question of balance. On the 
                         one hand, the reputation, and, so, 
                         the effectiveness of our hospital, 
                         and two of her important doctors -- 
                         and, on the other hand, the rights 
                         of your client.

               ANGLE

               Galvin seated across from the Bishop. A YOUNG PRIEST seated, 
               discreetly, attentively, across the room. Sherry glasses in 
               front of Galvin and the Bishop. Galvin drinking from his.

                                     BISHOP
                         A young woman. In her prime... 
                         deprived of...
                              (searches for a word)
                         ...life... sight... her family... 
                         It's tragic. It's a tragic accident.

               Galvin has been dreaming.

                                     BISHOP
                         ...nothing, of course, can begin to 
                         make it right. But we must do what 
                         we can. We must do all that we can.

               He gestures to the Young Priest, who crosses the room, 
               extracts a sheet from a file folder, and places it before 
               Galvin, who is sitting as if in a dream. The Bishop waits a 
               beat, not wanting to interrupt Galvin's reverie, then catches 
               his eye and gestures down at the paper. Galvin glances down.

               INSERT

               The sheet: "I, Frank P. Galvin, duly appointed conservator 
               for Deborah Ann Kaye, in consideration of Two Hundred Ten 
               Thousand Dollars ($210,000.00) paid in hand to me this day 
               by St. Catherine Laboure Hospital do hereby release from any 
               and all claims..."

               Galvin and the Bishop as before. Galvin finishes reading, 
               looks up.

                                     BISHOP
                         Yes. We must try to make it right.

               Beat. Galvin nods. Beat. Bishop nods discreetly to the Young 
               Priest who extracts Mount Blanc fountain pen from his pocket, 
               holds it out to Galvin.

                                     BISHOP
                         It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin...
                              (beat)
                         ...nothing can make the woman well... 
                         but we try to compensate... to make 
                         a gesture...

                                     GALVIN
                         How did you settle on the amount?

                                     BISHOP
                         We thought it was just.

                                     GALVIN
                         You thought it was just.

                                     BISHOP
                         Yes.

                                     GALVIN
                         Because it struck me how neatly 
                         'three' went into the amount. Two 
                         Hundred Ten Thousand. That would 
                         mean I keep seventy.

                                     BISHOP
                         That was our insurance company's 
                         recommendation.

                                     GALVIN
                         Yes. It would be.

               A beat.

                                     BISHOP
                         Nothing that we can do can make that 
                         woman well.

                                     GALVIN
                         And no one will know the truth.

                                     BISHOP
                         What is the truth?

                                     GALVIN
                         That that poor girl put her trust in 
                         the hands of two men who took her 
                         life, she's in a coma, her life is 
                         gone. She has no family, she has no 
                         home, she's tied to a machine, she 
                         has no friends -- and the people who 
                         should care for her: her Doctors, 
                         and you, and me, have been bought 
                         off to look the other way. We have 
                         been paid to look the other way. I 
                         came in here to take your money.
                              (beat)
                         I brought snapshots to show you. So 
                         I could get your money.
                              (to Young Priest, 
                              waving away document)
                         I can't take it. If I take it. If I 
                         take that money I'm lost. I'm just 
                         going to be a rich ambulance chaser.
                              (beat; pleading for 
                              understanding)
                         I can't do it. I can't take it.

                                     YOUNG PRIEST
                         If we may discuss money, Mr. Galvin. 
                         How is your law practice?

                                     GALVIN
                         It's not too good. I've only got one 
                         client.

               HOLD.

               INT. LAWYERS ROOM AND CORRIDOR - DAY

               Galvin, determined, coming down a corridor in the Courthouse, 
               opens a door. CAMERA FOLLOWS him IN. The Lawyers Room.

               Ten or twelve AMBULANCE CHASERS waiting for clients. They 
               all look up as he enters, then return to their reading, 
               phones, card games. CAMERA FOLLOWS him TO the corner of the 
               room where MICKEY MORRISSEY is playing Gin with a CRONY.

                                     GALVIN
                         I have to talk to you.

                                     MICKEY
                         What do you want?

                                     GALVIN
                              (dragging him up)
                         Come on. Let's get a drink.

                                     MICKEY
                              (sighs, to partner)
                         Don't touch anything.

               Galvin leads Mickey out of the room.

               INT. FIRST CORRIDOR COURTHOUSE - DAY

               Mickey and Galvin silhouetted against a window at the end of 
               the dark corridor, arguing.

                                     MICKEY
                              (enraged)
                         Are you out of your mind...?

                                     GALVIN
                         ...I'm going to need your help...

                                     MICKEY
                         You need my help...? You need a 
                         goddamn keeper... are you telling me 
                         that you turned down two-hundred-ten 
                         grand?
                              (beat)
                         Huh...? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you 
                         nuts. What are you going to do, bring 
                         her back to life?

                                     GALVIN
                         I'm going to help her.

                                     MICKEY
                         To do what...? To do what, for 
                         chrissake...? To help her to do what? 
                         She's dead...

                                     GALVIN
                         They killed her. And they're trying 
                         to buy it...

                                     MICKEY
                         That's the point, you stupid fuck. 
                         Let them buy it. We let them buy the 
                         case. That's what I took it for. You 
                         let this drop -- we'll go up to New 
                         Hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer...

               He turns away.

                                     GALVIN

                         What?

                                     GALVIN
                         You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if 
                         not now, when...'

                                     MICKEY
                         I know what I said but not now. You 
                         won it. Franky. You won it. When 
                         they give you the money, that means 
                         that you won. We don't want to go to 
                         court -- is this getting to you...?

               You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie 
               Concannon.

                         ...he's a good man...? He's the Prince 
                         of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have 
                         people in there testifying that the 
                         broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday 
                         on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't 
                         fuck with this case.

                                     MICKEY
                         Frank, but not now. Frank. You're 
                         trying to wipe out some old business. 
                         But not now. I understand. But you 
                         go call 'em back. You call the Bishop 
                         back.

                                     GALVIN
                         I have to try this case. I have to 
                         do it, Mick. I've got to stand up 
                         for that girl. I need your help.
                              (beat)
                         Mick, will you help me...?
                              (beat)
                         Will you help me...?

               INT. CONCANNON OFFICES CORRIDOR --DAY

               A young ATTORNEY in shirt-sleeves and vest racing through a 
               huge, ultra-modern, ultra-successful legal office. The office 
               is near empty. A couple of secretaries are at their desks, a 
               couple of lawyers in their cubicles. The CAMERA FOLLOWS the 
               Attorney tearing through the corridors of the office, up a 
               spiral staircase, through yet more office space, into:

               INT. CONCANNON CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

               ...a conference room. Mahogany, tinted glass, a panoramic 
               view of Boston. Twenty-five attorneys, male and female, mostly 
               young, gaze at the young Attorney as he enters the room. He 
               stops running. He approaches the front of the room 
               tentatively. Standing at the blackboard in front of the 
               conference room is EDWARD CONCANNON. Senior partner of the 
               firm, late fifties, imposing, he radiates success. As the 
               young Attorney approaches Concannon he is stopped with a 
               gesture. Concannon addresses the room.

                                     CONCANNON
                              (smiling)
                         Anybody ever hear, 'For want of a 
                         shoe a horse was lost?' Who's going 
                         on vacation tomorrow?

               A young MAN raises his hand.

                                     CONCANNON
                         Friedman. St. Barts. is that right?

                         tomorrow morning please, Sal. I tell 
                         you what, send her a sunlamp.
                              (smiles, there is 
                              laughter from the 
                              room; to Friedman, 
                              sympathetic)
                         I'm sorry, but you'll have to stay. 
                         No vacations till this thing is 
                         cleared.

               Concannon motions to the young Attorney who has run in. The 
               young Attorney goes to Concannon and hands him a box of chalk.

               Concannon takes a piece and writes on the blackboard "Jan. 
               12th." He underlines it heavily.

                                     CONCANNON
                         Our court date is January twelfth. 
                         You're all acquainted with this case. 
                         It's been scheduled for eighteen 
                         months. We have the attorney for the 
                         Plaintiff, Frank Galvin -- and I 
                         trust you are all familiar with his 
                         record -- and we have been expecting 
                         him to call us to negotiate. As he 
                         did not, and five days before we're 
                         supposed to go to court we made him 
                         a rather generous offer, which he 
                         refused. Five days before the trial. 
                         What does this mean? I want to find 
                         out.
                              (writes on the 
                              blackboard, "1) 
                              Research")
                              (writes "2) Homework")
                         Acquaint yourselves again with the 
                         depositions. Don't rely on the fact 
                         that we did it last year. Do it again. 
                         We're going to review them here, and 
                         you do it at home. You each have a 
                         full file. Know the deps, and I want 
                         you all to be here when we work with 
                         the defendants... when is that, 
                         Billy...?

               The young Attorney responds.

                         I want an article in the Globe As

                         files. I want something in Monday's

                         Our clients are: the Archdiocese of 
                         Boston; St. Catherine Laboure 
                         Hospital, and Drs. Marx and Towler, 
                         two of the most respected men in 
                         their profession. The thrust of this 
                         defense will be to answer in court, 
                         in the press and in the public mind -- 
                         to answer the accusation of negligence 
                         this completely: not only that we 
                         win the case, but that we win the 
                         case so that it's seen that the attack 
                         on these men and this institution 
                         was a rank obscenity.

               INT. LAW LIBRARY - NIGHT

               Galvin and Mickey at a library table piled with books. A 
               dingy, dusty law library. They are smoking, speak in 
               undertones, referring to the yellow legal pads in front of 
               them. Rehashing material.

                                     MICKEY
                         Who have we got?

                                     GALVIN
                         We've got her sister. Testifies she 
                         had a meal one hour before she was 
                         admitted to the hospital. This is 
                         the point.

                                     MICKEY
                         You got the admittance form says 
                         patient ate nine hours prior to 
                         admittance.

                                     GALVIN
                         Admittance form is wrong.

                                     MICKEY
                         Forget it. You can't prove it. 
                         Sister's testimony is no good. Jury 
                         knows we win she gets the cash.

                                     GALVIN
                         I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her 
                         heart condition means they gave her 
                         the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus 
                         she came in complaining of stomach 
                         pains...

                         Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, 
                         the jury's going to love him, Mick... 
                         And you calm down, all right? Their

                         ...and they got depositions from the

                         They had an obstetrical nurse in 
                         there. We got a deposition from the 
                         obstetrical nurse?

                              (checking list)
                         No.

                                     GALVIN

                         How come she isn't speaking up.

                         Right.

               INT. O'ROURKE'S PUB - NIGHT

               Galvin and Mickey entering the bar, walk over to the bar.

               Galvin sees something O.S. Call to the bartender.

                                     GALVIN
                         Jimmy? Bushmills.
                              (turns to Mickey, 
                              whispers)
                         Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you 
                         a drink tomorrow.

                                     MICKEY
                         Yeah? And what are you going to do 
                         tonight?

                                     GALVIN
                         I'm going to get laid.

               Galvin motions with his head down at the end of the bar.

               ANGLE - P.O.V.

               The Woman from last night, sitting in her same place at the 
               end of the bar. Mickey looks at her. Shrugs. Gets up off 
               stool.

                                     MICKEY
                         Don't leave your best work in the 
                         sheets.

               He salutes, walks off.

               Galvin takes his drink and moves down to her.

                                     GALVIN
                         D'you find an apartment?

                         Still looking.

                                     GALVIN
                         I changed my life today. What did 
                         you do?

                                     LAURA
                         I changed my room at the Hotel.

                                     GALVIN
                         Why?

                                     LAURA
                         The TV didn't work.

                                     GALVIN

                                     LAURA
                         And what are you? A cop?

                                     GALVIN
                         I'm a lawyer.

                                     LAURA
                         My ex-husband was a lawyer.

                                     GALVIN
                         Really. How wonderful for you.

                                     LAURA
                         Yes. It was, actually.

                                     GALVIN
                         Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you 
                         call it off?

                                     LAURA
                         Who says I'm the one that called it 
                         off?

                                     GALVIN
                         A brick house says you divorced him. 
                         I'll put you on your honor. Bet you 
                         a hundred dollars against you join 
                         me for dinner. And I'll take your 
                         word for it. Now you tell me the 
                         truth. Because you cannot lie to me. 
                         What's your name?

                                     LAURA
                         Laura.

                                     GALVIN
                         My name's Frank. And furthermore, 
                         you came back to see me tonight.

                                     LAURA
                         What if it wasn't you that I came 
                         back to see?

                                     GALVIN
                         You just got lucky.
                              (gets up off stool)
                         D'you eat yet? Come on.

               She gets up from the stool and starts following him in spite 
               of herself.

                                     GALVIN
                         Jesus, you are one beautiful woman.

               INT. O'ROURKE'S - NIGHT (LATER)

               Galvin and Laura are in a booth. The remains of a dinner and 
               drinks around them. They are both smoking cigarettes, intent 
               on each other. Both a little drunk.

                                     GALVIN
                         The weak, the weak have got to have 
                         somebody to fight for them. Isn't 
                         that the truth? You want another 
                         drink?

                                     LAURA
                         I think I will.

               Galvin motions "another round" to the bartender.

                                     GALVIN
                         Jimmy!
                              (beat)
                         That's why the court exists. The 
                         court doesn't exist to give them 
                         justice, eh? But to give them a chance 
                         at justice.

                                     LAURA
                         And are they going to get it?

                                     GALVIN
                         They might. Yes. That's the point... 
                         is that they might... you see, the 
                         jury wants to believe. They're all 
                         cynics, sure, because they want to 
                         believe. I have to go in there 
                         tomorrow to find twelve people to 
                         hear this case. I'm going to see a 
                         hundred people and pick twelve. And 
                         every one of them it's written on 
                         their face, 'This is a sham. There 
                         is no justice...' but in their heart 
                         they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'

                                     LAURA
                         Maybe what?

                                     GALVIN
                              (beat)
                         Maybe I can do something right.

                                     LAURA
                         And is that what you're going to do?
                              (a beat)
                         Is that what you're going to do...?

                                     GALVIN
                         That's what I'm going to try to do.

               INT. GALVIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               The bedroom, dark, sound of people moving, the bedside light 
               is flicked on. We SEE Galvin in shirt-sleeves, holding a 
               whiskey glass a little unsettled, turning on the light, Laura, 
               with a glass, also a bit unsteady, standing beside him.

               Both awkward. He looks at her, turns back to the bed, turns 
               down the bed, sees the silver-framed picture of his wife, he 
               looks back at Laura, starts to take the picture to turn it 
               down.

                                     LAURA
                         That's all right.

               She starts taking off her blouse.

               INT. COURTHOUSE BAR-INSERT - DAY

               A half-full old-fashioned glass.

               ANGLE

               Galvin sitting at the fairly well-equipped bar, still. He 
               looks out of the window at a building across the street.

               EXT. COURTHOUSE - P.O.V. SHOT - DAY

               The courthouse across the street.

               INT. COURTHOUSE BAR - DAY

               Galvin glances at bar clock.

               ANGLE - P.O.V.

               The clock reads 10:12.

               ANGLE

               Galvin downs his drink, picks his briefcase off of the bar 
               and starts for the door.

               INT. JUDGE SWEENEY'S CHAMBERS-DAY

               JUDGE SWEENEY, a florid man in his sixties, sitting in 
               shirtsleeves eating bacon and eggs off of a hotel service on 
               a tray, talking conspiratorially with Ed Concannon, who is 
               drinking coffee, seated across the desk. They are obviously 
               old friends. The sound of a door opening. They turn their 
               heads to the door.

               ANGLE - P.O.V.

               Galvin standing in the door.

                                     JUDGE (V.O.)
                         You're late, Mr. Galvin.

               He enters the room. CAMERA FOLLOWS him as he sits next to 
               Concannon.

                                     GALVIN
                         Yessir. I'm sorry.

                                     JUDGE
                         Why is that?

                                     GALVIN
                         I was held up.

               Concannon smiles and extends his hand.

                                     CONCANNON
                         Ed Concannon.

                                     GALVIN
                              (shaking his head)
                         Frank Galvin. We've met before.

               As the Judge starts to speak Galvin cannot help looking at 
               Concannon out of the corner of his eye.

                                     JUDGE
                         Let's do some business.

               ANGLE - P.O.V. GALVIN

               Concannon, brisk, expensive-looking, tanned, huge gold watch, 
               custom-made suit.

                                     JUDGE (V.O.)
                         They tell me that no bargain ever 
                         was completed other than quickly 
                         when both parties really cared to 
                         make a deal.

               Concannon feels Galvin's eye on him, half-turns, smiles.

               ANGLE - THE JUDGE, CONCANNON, GALVIN

                                     JUDGE
                         Now, have you boys tried to resolve 
                         your little difficulty because that 
                         certainly would save the Commonwealth 
                         a lot of time and bother.

                                     GALVIN
                         This is a complicated case, your 
                         Honor...

                                     JUDGE
                         I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me 
                         tell you something. If we find it so 
                         complex, how in the hell you think 
                         you're going to make a jury understand 
                         it?
                              (smiles at Galvin)
                         See my point? Let's talk a minute. 
                         Frank: what will you and your client 
                         take right now this very minute to 
                         walk out of here and let this damn 
                         thing drop?

                                     GALVIN
                         My client can't walk, your Honor.

                                     JUDGE
                         I know full well she can't, Frank. 
                         You see the Padre on your way out 
                         and he'll punch your ticket. You 
                         follow me? I'm trying to help you.

                                     CONCANNON
                         Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the 
                         Archdiocese have offered plaintiff 
                         two hundred and ten thousand dollars.

                                     JUDGE
                         Huh!

                                     CONCANNON
                         My doctors didn't want a settlement 
                         at any price. They wanted this cleared 
                         up in court. They want their 
                         vindication. I agree with them. But 
                         for today the offer stands. Before 
                         we begin the publicity of a trial. 
                         For today only.
                              (beat)
                         When I walk out that door the offer 
                         is withdrawn.
                              (turns to Galvin)
                         As long as you understand that.
                              (beat)
                         It's got to be that way.

                                     GALVIN
                         We are going to try the case.

               A beat. Galvin fumbles for a cigarette. The three sit in 
               silence.

                                     JUDGE
                              (incredulous)
                         That's it...?
                              (beat)
                         Come on, guys... life is too short...
                              (beat)
                         You tell me if you're playing 
                         'chicken,' or you mean it.
                              (beat; turns to Galvin)
                         Frank: I don't think I'm talking out 
                         of school, but I just heard someone 
                         offer you two hundred grand... and 
                         that's a lot of money... and if I 
                         may say, you haven't got the best of 
                         records.

                                     GALVIN
                         ...things change.

                                     JUDGE
                         ...that's true. Sometimes they change, 
                         sometimes they don't. Now, I remember 
                         back to when you were disbarred...

                                     GALVIN
                         I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the 
                         pro...

                                     JUDGE
                         And it seems to me, a fella's trying 
                         to come back, he'd take this 
                         settlement, and get a record for 
                         himself.
                              (beat)
                         I myself would take it and run like 
                         a thief.

                                     GALVIN
                         I'm sure you would.

               The Judge turns, unbelieving that Galvin has patronized and 
               insulted him. He controls himself.

                                     JUDGE
                         Hm.
                              (beat; checking book)
                         We have the date set? Next Thursday. 
                         Good.
                              (smiles)
                         See you boys in court.

               ANGLE

               Galvin, seated at the conference table intent on the form in 
               front of him. He crosses out something with a pen. Galvin 
               takes the form, rises, walks across the room, walks by the 
               defense table with Concannon and an Aide at it. Approaches 
               the Jury Box, which has several prospective JURORS in it.

               He is very nervous. He addresses a man.

                                     GALVIN
                         Mr. Abraham...

                         I'm fine.

                         Good.
                              (beat)
                         You ever been inside a hospital?

                         Yes.

                                     GALVIN
                         Ah. How did they treat you?

               Galvin has flop sweat, Abrams is becoming intractable.

                                     ABRAMS
                         I don't know what you mean.

               Mickey standing by the door to the courtroom, looking through 
               the glass panel, a newspaper under his arm, smoking. Galvin 
               comes out.

                                     MICKEY
                         Been a long time, huh...?

                                     GALVIN
                         I'm getting it back. Don't worry 
                         about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find 
                         the obstetric nurse?

                         Mary Rooney. She won't talk to me. I 
                         tried her at the hospital. I'm going 
                         to try her back at home. Read this.

               He hands Galvin the newspaper. Galvin takes it, reads.

               ANGLE - P.O.V.

               The newspaper, folded to Page Two. A full-page photo of 
               smiling doctors clustered around an operating table. Huge 
               caption: "International Honors to St. Catherine Laboure 
               Hospital. The faculte Internationale de la Chirurgerie today 
               announced St. Catherine's as this year's recipient of the

               ANGLE

               Galvin reading. Looks up.

                                     GALVIN
                         So what?

                                     MICKEY
                         So what...? The best is yet to come. 
                         Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. 
                         Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 
                         'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'

                                     GALVIN
                         They still have to take it to a jury.

               Looks back at his form.

                                     MICKEY
                         What I'm saying, they're getting 
                         some help.

                                     GALVIN
                              (looks annoyed)
                         So what do you want me to do? 
                         Concannon's going to try the case 
                         his way, I'm going to try it mine. 
                         You want me to go wee wee wee all 
                         the time because he's got some flack, 
                         got stories in the newspaper. I'm 
                         going to win this case.

               They start walking across the Courthouse corridor. Mickey 
               veers off and stops at a Cigar Stand.

               To the STAND OPERATOR:

                         Oh shit, what's today?

                                     MICKEY
                         Today is Tuesday. What?

                                     GALVIN
                         I've got to go see Gruber.
                              (to Cigar Stand 
                              Operator)
                         What's the best cigars you have?

                                     MICKEY
                         Give 'em a box of Macanudos.

                                     GALVIN
                         Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody 
                         at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.

                                     JOHN
                         Here you are, Franky.

                                     GALVIN
                              (takes box)
                         Thanks. Can you go over and meet 
                         her...? Tell her I'll stop by when 
                         I'm through... Laura Fischer...

                                     MICKEY
                         Sure. Who is she?

                                     JOHN
                         That's thirty-three bucks. Can you 
                         believe that...?

                                     MICKEY
                         Oh, yeah. Your broad from last night.

               Galvin pays the Cigar Stand Operator.

                                     JOHN
                         Thanks, Franky.

                                     GALVIN
                         Tell her that I'll meet her there, 
                         okay? See you tomorrow in the office.

               Mickey shrugs.

                                     GALVIN
                         We're doing fine.

               ANGLE

               The two of them crossing the lobby.

               Dick Doneghy, looking around the lobby, spies them, starts 
               across, and accosts Galvin.

                                     DONEGHY
                         You said you're gonna call me up. 
                         You didn't call me up. Who do you 
                         think you are?
                              (pushes Galvin into a 
                              wall; advances; pushes 
                              him again)
                         Who do you think you are...?

                                     GALVIN
                         Hold on a second.

                                     DONEGHY
                         I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm 
                         going to have your ticket. You know 
                         what you did? Do you know what you 
                         did?

               He pushes Galvin again. Galvin waves Mickey off.

                                     GALVIN
                         It's all right, Mickey.

                                     DONEGHY
                         You ruined my life, Mister... Me and 
                         my wife... and I am going to ruin 
                         yours...
                              (pushes Galvin again)
                         You don't have to go out there to 
                         see that girl. We been going four 
                         years.
                              (beat)
                         Four years... my wife's been crying 
                         herself to sleep what they, what, 
                         what they did to her sister.

                                     GALVIN
                         I swear to you I wouldn't have turned 
                         the offer down unless I thought that 
                         I could win the case...

                                     DONEGHY
                         What you thought!? What you thought... 
                         I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get 
                         my wife out of town, we hired you, 
                         we're paying you, I got to find out 
                         from the other side they offered two 
                         hundred...

                                     GALVIN
                         I'm going to win this case... Mist... 
                         Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury 
                         with a solid case, a famous doctor 
                         as an expert witness, and I'm going 
                         to win eight hundred thousand dollars.

                                     DONEGHY
                         You guys, you guys, you're all the 
                         same. The Doctors at the hospital, 
                         you... it's 'What I'm going to do 
                         for you'; but you screw up it's 'We 
                         did the best that we could. I'm 
                         dreadfully sorry...' And people like 
                         me live with your mistakes the rest 
                         of our lives.

               He nods sadly to himself. Beat.

                                     GALVIN
                         If I could accept the offer right 
                         now, I would.
                              (beat)
                         They took it back.

                                     DONEGHY
                         I understand.
                              (starts to walk away 
                              from Galvin; stops)
                         I went to the Bar Association. They 
                         tell me you're going to be disbarred.

               INT. O'ROURKE'S PUB - NIGHT

               Laura is sitting in the same place at the bar. Mickey comes 
               up to her.

                                     MICKEY
                         Franky can't make it. He had an 
                         appointment he forgot, he's going to 
                         see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, 
                         we're supposed to get to know each 
                         other.

                                     LAURA
                         How'm I doing so far?

                                     MICKEY
                         So far you're great. You got a 
                         cigarette?

               Laura opens her purse, starts hunting for a cigarette.

                                     LAURA
                         What are you drinking?
                              (hands him cigarettes, 
                              smiles, calls the 
                              Bartender)
                         Jimmy...?

               INT. GRUBER'S HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Galvin walks up to a door marked Doctors Only. He opens his 
               briefcase, takes out the box of Macanudo Cigars, smiles to 
               himself, walks inside.

               INT. DOCTORS' LOCKER ROOM - GRUBER'S LOCKER

               Galvin enters, looks around, it is empty. He looks at the 
               clock, takes out his appointment book, turns to appropriate 
               page.

               ANGLE - P.O.V.

               The book, written very large: "Dr. Gruber. 7:00 P.M. 
               Hospital."

               ANGLE

               Galvin standing, he waits a beat. Starts out of locker room.

               INT. GRUBER'S HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NURSES' STATION - NIGHT

               CAMERA FOLLOWS him TO Nurses' Station. He speaks to the NURSE 
               behind the desk.

                                     GALVIN
                         Dr. Gruber.

                                     NURSE
                         Dr. Gruber's not here today, Sir.

                                     GALVIN
                         No... No...

               She glances down, checks a sheet.

                                     NURSE
                         Yes, Sir. He hasn't been in all day... 
                         He's not on the chart...

               EXT. GRUBER'S OFFICE BUILDING AND STREET - NIGHT

               Galvin walking in the snow. Stops outside of a very lovely 
               brownstone with a small brass plaque. The plaque: Dr. David 
               C. Gruber. M.D. P.C.

               ANGLE

               Galvin looking in through the window of the dark, deserted 
               ground-floor office. He knocks on the door. Nothing. He knocks 
               again. Nothing. He stands unbelieving.

               EXT. GRUBER'S HOUSE & STREET - NIGHT

               Galvin getting out of a taxi, rushing up the steps of a 
               brownstone. Peeps through the window on the side of the house. 
               Dark. He grabs the brass knocker. Pounds. Nothing, he pounds 
               again. Nothing. He is beaten. He is without resource. He 
               starts vacantly down the stairs. The door behind him is 
               opened. He turns.

               ANGLE - P.O.V.

               A middle-aged black WOMAN in livery.

                                     MAID
                         What is it?

               Galvin in the steps speaking with her.

                                     GALVIN
                         Dr. Gruber.

                                     MAID
                         Dr. Gruber's not in.

                                     GALVIN
                         I had an appointment at his office, 
                         I think I must have got it wrong. We 
                         had a meeting...

                                     MAID
                         He's not in, Sir.

                                     GALVIN
                         Where is he?

               She hesitates. She has been instructed not to say. Galvin 
               starts up the steps.

                                     GALVIN
                         I... please. My wife... my wife's 
                         prescription has run out. If I can 
                         call him...

                                     MAID
                         Dr. Halpern's taking all his...

                                     GALVIN
                         No, no, no. I have to talk to him. 
                         If I can only call him...

                                     MAID
                              (beat)
                         He's... you can't reach him, Sir. 
                         He's in the, on some island in the 
                         Caribbean, they don't have a phone.
                              (beat)
                         He'll be back in a week...
                              (beat)
                         If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...

               Galvin turns away from the door. He is still clutching the 
               box of cigars unconsciously.

               INT. O'ROURKE'S - NIGHT

               Mickey and Laura. Positions unchanged, at the bar. Somewhat 
               progressed toward a convivial drunkenness

                                     MICKEY
                         Stearns, Harrington, you know who

                         everything's superb. Franky, he's 
                         starting to talk like he comes from 
                         Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 
                         'You must drop by with Pat and me...' 
                         Okay...?

                                     LAURA
                         Yes.

                         ...and he's making a billion dollars 
                         every minute working for Stearns, 
                         Harrington, and he bought a dog, and

                         Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a

                         That Frank was working on. Yeah. He 
                         thought Franky needed some help, so 
                         they bribed a juror. So Franky finds 
                         out. He comes to me in tears. He 
                         thinks that anybody who knows what a 
                         'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I 
                         told him 'Franky, wake up. These 
                         people are sharks. What do you think 
                         they got so rich from? Doing good?' 
                         He can't be comforted. He tells the 
                         boys at Stearns and Harrington they've 
                         disappointed him, he's going to the 
                         Judge to rat them out.

                                     LAURA
                         Huh.

                                     MICKEY
                         Before he can get there here comes 
                         this Federal Marshal, and Franky's 
                         indicted for Jury tampering, they 
                         throw him in jail, he's gonna be 
                         disbarred, his life is over.
                              (beat)
                         Jimmy, gimme another drink.
                              (to Laura)
                         How are you?

                                     LAURA
                              (to Jimmy)
                         Me, too.

                                     MICKEY
                         Okay. Now, so he's in jail. He, 
                         finally, he gets to see the light, 
                         he calls up Harrington, he says he 
                         thinks he made a mistake. As if by 
                         magic, charges against him are 
                         dropped, he's released from jail.
                              (beat)
                         P.S. He's fired from the firm, his 
                         wife divorces him, he turns to drink 
                         and mopes around three and a half 
                         years.
                              (beat)

               She looks at him. HOLD.

               EXT. JUDGE SWEENEY'S HOUSE-NIGHT

               Snow falling. Galvin standing outside, having just rung the 
               bell. The door is opened by a gangly teen-age boy. CAMERA 
               FOLLOWS Galvin into...

               INT. JUDGE SWEENEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               ...the hall of the house. The boy motions toward a closed 
               sliding door and then goes into the living room opposite.

               Galvin hangs up his coat on the hall coat rack, we hear the 
               boy resume the practice of a passage of Chopin on the piano.

               Galvin knocks on the sliding door.

                                     JUDGE (O.S.)
                         Yes?

               Galvin opens the door and goes into the Judge's darkened 
               study. The Judge is watching a basketball game on TV, drinking 
               a beer. CAMERA FOLLOWS Galvin into the room.

                                     JUDGE
                         What is it?

                                     GALVIN
                         Thank you for seeing me.

                                     JUDGE
                         That's perfectly all right.

               Judge turns down the volume of the game, but keeps watching 
               it.

                                     GALVIN
                         I need an extension for my case.

                                     JUDGE
                         You should have taken their offer. 
                         Especially if you were unprepared.

                                     GALVIN
                         I had a witness disappear on me.

                                     JUDGE
                         That happens.

                                     GALVIN
                         I could subpoena him if I had a week.

                                     JUDGE
                         I don't have a week. This case never 
                         should have come to trial. You know 
                         better. You're Mr. Independent. You 
                         want to be independent? Be independent 
                         now. I've got no sympathy for you.

               Judge leans forward, turns up the volume on the game.

               EXT. STREET - GALVIN - PHONE - NIGHT

               LONG SHOT of cars whooshing in the snow past a lonely street 
               corner. A MAN at an open telephone stand. The sound of the 
               telephone on the far end ringing.

               ANGLE

               Galvin at the stand, shivering in the cold, talking on the 
               phone. An open note pad in his bare hand.

                         I have to reach him. This is an 
                         emergency. Could you give me his

                         I'll give you my number, and ask

                         I understand. Thank you, my name is 
                         Galvin. I'll be at the following 
                         number in a half an hour. It's urgent.

               INT. GALVIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Galvin is sitting at his desk, a stack of files piled on his 
               desk, he is sorting through them looking for something. The 
               phone rings, he snatches it up.

                                     GALVIN
                              (into phone)
                         Hello. Yes. Thank you for calling. 
                         Frank Galvin... I'm representing 
                         Deborah Ann Kaye...? I'd like to 
                         discuss your firm's offer of the two 
                         hundred th... In the sense that I 
                         feel that we'd like to accept it.
                              (beat)
                         Well, it's rather a shock to me, 
                         too; but it's my client's wishes... 
                         She's changed her mind as of this 
                         evening... I must say that I tried 
                         to dissuade her...

               He wipes his sweating forehead, he hears the sound of his 
               office door opening, he looks up.

               ANGLE - P.O.V.

               Mickey opening the front door to the office, carrying an 
               armful of lawbooks, and a couple of files, he turns on the 
               lights in the anteroom, and we SEE that he is surprised to 
               see Galvin in the office.

               ANGLE - GALVIN

               On the phone.

                                     GALVIN
                         ...Well, she, on the eve of the 
                         case... You understand... I think 
                         quite frankly she's come down with 
                         nerves and she'd like...

               A beat. Mickey comes tentatively into the room and sits at 
               the desk across from Galvin.

                                     GALVIN
                         When was that arrived at...?
                              (beat)
                         I, I know what Mr. Concannon said, 
                         but... I... Well, I think you're 
                         making a mistake... I think that you 
                         should reconsider; why don't you 
                         check with your principals, and I'll 
                         call you in the...

                         No?... you... uh. All right. No. 
                         That's fine. I understand. Sorry to 
                         bother you at home.

               He hangs up the phone. Sits rock still. Beat.

                                     MICKEY
                         What happened...?

               Galvin starts searching through his files again.

                                     MICKEY
                         What happened, Joey...?

                                     GALVIN
                         I can't talk now.

                                     MICKEY
                         D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...?

               Galvin has found the sheet he is looking for, he extracts it 
               from the file.

               ANGLE - P.O.V.

               The sheet of yellowing paper. Headed "DEBORAH ANN KAYE Poss. 
               Drs. to testify: Contact: Dr. Lucien Thompson, Mineola Long 
               Island; Dr. Duane Litchey..." He turns to second sheet.

               It is a letter-headed sheet, "Lucien Thompson, M.D." "Dear 
               Mr. Galvin, after studying the case material on Deborah Ann 
               Kaye, I would be glad..." Galvin turns back to first sheet, 
               underlines THOMPSON in red.

                         had some correspondence some time 
                         ago...? That's right. I'm sorry that 
                         we never got back, the case was 
                         postponed, and I've had a changeover 
                         in staff... I'm sorry to call you so

               ANGLE

               Mickey, looking pityingly at Galvin. Mickey sees the box of 
               Macanudo Cigars on the desk, picks them up, starts to open 
               them -- throws them across the room in disgust.

                                     GALVIN (V.O.)
                         ...but we have had a change of

               Galvin in pants and shirt carrying a drink, distraught, 
               frightened. Standing in the doorway of his sitting room.

               ANGLE

               Laura in slacks and sweater coming out of the kitchen with 
               her drink. She sits at worktable on which are Galvin's

                         We, we... No... we just had a small

                         ...and is that serious?

               Galvin, suddenly focuses, starts for worktable.

                         I've got to work.

                                     LAURA
                         You can't work if you can't think. 
                         You get in bed. It's all right. I'll 
                         stay here with you. It's all right. 
                         Come on...

                                     GALVIN
                         You're going to stay here...?

                                     LAURA
                         Yes.

               A beat.

                                     GALVIN
                         I'm only going to rest a little while.

               She leads him into the bedroom.

               ANGLE - LATER

               Same room, Laura, dressed in Galvin's bathrobe, sitting in 
               the easy chair next to his worktable, smoking a cigarette, 
               reading an old hard-cover novel. She looks up across the 
               room.

               ANGLE - P.O.V.

               The door to the bedroom, closed.

               ANGLE

               Laura sighs, takes a drag. Puts the book down on her lap.

               Sits, thinking.

               INT. CONCANNON'S CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

               Witness stand. DR. TOWLER, a distinguished man in his fifties, 
               sitting on the stand. Concannon o.s. The doctor is ill-at- 
               ease; smiles nervously.

                                     CONCANNON (V.O.)
                         What is your name, please?

                                     TOWLER
                         Dr. Robert Towler.

                                     CONCANNON (V.O.)
                         You were Deborah Ann Kaye's doctor...?

                                     DR. TOWLER
                         No, actually, she was referred to 
                         me. She was Dr. Hagman's patient...

                                     CONCANNON
                         Don't equivocate. Be positive. Just 
                         tell the truth.

               ANGLE

               The conference room. WIDE. Concannon's young lawyers taking 
               notes as Concannon rehearses Dr. Towler, a Sony VTR being 
               operated by one of them.

                                     CONCANNON
                         Whatever the 'truth' is, let's hear 
                         that. You were her doctor.

                                     DR. TOWLER
                         Yes.

                                     CONCANNON
                         Say it.

                                     DR. TOWLER
                         I was her doctor.

                                     CONCANNON
                         You were the anesthesiologist at her 
                         delivery May twelfth, nineteen 
                         seventy...

                                     DR. TOWLER
                         ...I was one of a group of...

                                     CONCANNON
                         Answer affirmatively. Simply. Keep 
                         those answers to three words. You 
                         weren't 'part of a group,' you were 
                         her anesthesiologist. Isn't that 
                         right?

                                     DR. TOWLER
                         Yes.

                                     CONCANNON
                         You were there to help Dr. Marx 
                         deliver her baby. Were you not?

                                     DR. TOWLER
                         Yes.

               ANGLE

               Concannon starts to stroll a bit around the conference room, 
               in back of the assembled assistants, by the large windows, 
               which offer a panoramic view of Boston.

                                     CONCANNON
                         Anything special about the case?

                                     DR. TOWLER
                         When she...

               The young lawyer (BILLY), Concannon's right-hand assistant, 
               raises his hand to get Concannon's attention.

                                     CONCANNON
                              (to Dr. Towler, 
                              correcting him)
                         When 'Debby'...
                              (to Young Lawyer)
                         Thank you.

               Young Lawyer nods, makes a notation in his pad.

                                     DR. TOWLER
                         Thank you. When Debby...

                                     CONCANNON
                              (switching his tack)
                         Dr. Towler, who was in the operating 
                         room with you?

                                     DR. TOWLER
                         Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr. 
                         Marx, of course...

               He nods toward Dr. Marx who is in the audience, who nods 
               back.

                                     DR. TOWLER
                         Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...

                                     CONCANNON
                         What did these people do when her 
                         heart stopped?

                                     DR. TOWLER
                         We went to Code Blue...

                                     CONCANNON
                         'Code Blue,' what does that mean...?

                                     DR. TOWLER
                         It's a common medical expression, 
                         it's a crash program to restore the 
                         heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in 
                         her trachea, to get her oxygen, her 
                         and the baby... Ms. Nevins...

                                     CONCANNON
                         Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?

                                     DR. TOWLER
                         Well, many reasons, actually...

                                     CONCANNON
                         Tell me one?

                                     DR. TOWLER
                         She'd aspirated vomitus into her 
                         mask...

                                     CONCANNON
                         She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Let's cut 
                         the bullshit. Say it: She THREW UP 
                         IN HER MASK.

               A beat.

                                     DR. TOWLER
                         She threw up in her mask.

               Concannon nods to the Young Lawyer, who is conscientiously 
               taking notes.

                                     CONCANNON
                         ...and her heart stopped and she 
                         wasn't getting oxygen.

                                     DR. TOWLER
                         That's right.

                                     CONCANNON
                         And what did your team do...

                                     DR. TOWLER
                         Well, we...

                         ...You brought thirty years of medical 
                         experience to bear. Isn't that what

                         You reached down into death. Now, 
                         isn't that right?

                                     DR. TOWLER
                              (getting overcome)
                         My God, we tried to save her... You 
                         can't know... You can't know...

                              soothing)
                         Tell us.

               Beat. Dr. Towler sighs. He begins to speak.

               EXT. SOUTH STREET STATION - BOSTON - DAY

               People coming out of a just-arrived train.

               ANGLE

               Galvin watching them, he has a large boutonniere on his lapel.

               The departing PASSENGERS stream past him. An elderly BLACK

                         Mr. Galvin?

               Galvin turns. He is taken aback. He registers who it must 
               be.

                                     GALVIN

                         It was good of you to meet...

               Galvin cuts him off, takes his bag.

                                     GALVIN
                         Thank you for coming.

               They shake hands. They start...

               INT. SOUTH STREET STATION - DAY

               into the station. The CAMERA TRACKING BEFORE them. As Galvin 
               passes a wastebasket, he deposits his boutonniere.

                                     GALVIN
                         I have some errands to run, and then

                         These people play very rough. They 
                         don't want to lose this case. There's 
                         a lot of pressure they can bring to 
                         bear, I...

               Galvin starts them walking again.

                         Please, Sir. Please. Humor me.

                         I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing 
                         Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. 
                         Catherine Laboure.

                         I told the guy I didn't want to talk 
                         to...

                                     GALVIN
                         I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann 
                         Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. 
                         The case is going to trial. Our chief 
                         witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you 
                         know who he is?

                                     MARY ROONEY
                         No.

                         Anesthesiology, Massachusetts 
                         Commonwealth. He says your doctors, 
                         Towler and Marx, put my girl in the 
                         hospital for life. And we can prove 
                         that. What we don't know is why. 
                         What went on in there? In the O.R. 
                         That's what we'd like to know. 
                         Something went wrong. And you know 
                         what it was. They gave her the wrong 
                         anesthetic. What happened? The phone 
                         rang... someone got distracted... 
                         what?

                                     MARY ROONEY
                         ...you got your doctor's testimony. 
                         Why do you need me?

                         I want someone who was in the O.R. 
                         We're going to win the case, there's 
                         no question of that. It's just a 
                         matter of how big...

                         I've got nothing to say to you.

                         You know what happened.

                                     MARY ROONEY
                         Nothing happened.

                         Then why aren't you testifying for 
                         their side?

               She starts to close the door. He stops her.

                         I can subpoena you, you know. I can 
                         get you up there on the stand.

                                     MARY ROONEY

                         I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What 
                         do you owe them?

                                     MARY ROONEY
                         I don't owe them a goddamn thing.

                         Then why don't you testify?

                         Well, maybe you better do that, then.

                         You don't care who gets hurt. You're 
                         a bunch of whores. You'd do anything 
                         for a dollar. You got no loyalty...

                         I'm going to tell you how you handle 
                         the fact that he's black. You don't 
                         touch it. You don't mention it. You 
                         treat him like anybody else. Neither 
                         better or worse.

                         tell you something, Doctor, those

                         Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, 
                         I...

                                     MICKEY
                              (grilling him again)
                         Then what good would it do to ruin 
                         the reputation of two men, to help a 
                         girl whose life's not going to be 
                         changed in the least? You know what 
                         CODE BLUE means?

                                     DR. THOMPSON
                         'Code Blue'...

                                     MICKEY
                         It's a common medical term.

               Mickey half-turns to Galvin, shrugs minutely, meaning, "We're 
               in trouble."

               INT. LAURA'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Hotel room door SEEN from the inside.

               The handle starts to turn.

               ANGLE

               Galvin coming through the door.

               He looks at Laura, tiredly closes the door behind him, hangs 
               up his coat in the closet, moves into the room. As Galvin 
               walks into the room, the CAMERA PRECEDES him and TURNS so 
               that WE NOW SEE them BOTH.

                                     GALVIN
                         We're going to lose.

               A beat. Galvin looks out the window and then looks back to 
               Laura.

                                     GALVIN
                         Do you think it's my fault?

                                     LAURA
                         Isn't there something you...

                                     GALVIN
                         That's not the question. It's over.
                              (beat)
                         Do you think that it's my fault? If 
                         I'd... if I'd... I never should have 
                         taken it. There was no way that I 
                         was going to win.

                                     LAURA
                         You're talking like a drunk.

                                     GALVIN
                         That's what I am.

               Beat.

                                     LAURA
                         And it's over...?

                                     GALVIN
                         Yes.

                                     LAURA
                         Well, then what are you doing here?

                                     GALVIN
                         I... do you want me to leave?

                                     LAURA
                         You do what you want. You want to 
                         leave... You want to go kill yourself?

                                     GALVIN
                         I...

                                     LAURA
                         You want me to tell you it's your 
                         fault? It probably is. What are you 
                         going to do about it?
                              (beat)
                         I thought it's not over till the 
                         jury comes in.

                                     GALVIN
                         Who told you that?

                                     LAURA
                         You told me so. Maybe you'd get some 
                         sympathy. You came to the wrong place.

                                     GALVIN
                         And what makes you so tough?

                                     LAURA
                         Maybe I'll tell you later.

                                     GALVIN
                         Is there going to be a later...?

                                     LAURA
                         Not if you don't grow up...

                                     GALVIN
                         If I don't 'grow up...'

                                     LAURA
                         You're like a kid, you're coming in 
                         here like it's Saturday night, you 
                         want me to say that you've got a 
                         fever -- you don't have to go to 
                         school...

                                     GALVIN
                              (shakes head sadly)
                         You, you don't under...

                                     LAURA
                         Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You 
                         say you're going to lose. Is it my 
                         fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't 
                         start until tomorrow and already 
                         it's over for you!

                                     GALVIN
                         It's over!

                                     LAURA
                         What is your wife's picture doing by 
                         the side of your...

                                     GALVIN
                         What is that to you...?

                                     LAURA
                         What would you like it to be to me...? 
                         I, I, I can't invest in failure.

               Galvin gets up hurriedly.

                                     GALVIN
                         Excuse me, I've...

               He hurries out of the room. CAMERA FOLLOWS him into the 
               bathroom, he shuts the door, his chest heaves convulsively.

               He can't catch his breath... Beat. We hear a knock on the 
               door.

                                     LAURA (V.O.)
                         Joe...
                              (beat)
                         Joe...

                                     GALVIN
                              (screaming)
                         Stop pressuring me...

               The door opens, Galvin is still trying to catch his breath.

               Laura enters.

                                     LAURA
                         You're pressuring yourself...

                                     GALVIN
                              (shaking head, utterly 
                              denying her)
                         No... no...

                                     LAURA
                         Yes.
                              (beat)
                         We've all got to let go.

               INT. "D. KAYE" SIGN - COURTROOM CORRIDOR - DAY

               Galvin coming down the corridor with Sally Doneghy. They 
               stop by a door on which the card reads: "PART III. DEBORAH 
               ANN KAYE V. ST. CATHERINE LABOURE HOSPITAL ET AL."

               INT. COURTROOM - DAY

               They enter the courtroom. CAMERA FOLLOWS them in. The room 
               one-quarter filled. Concannon at the defense table with the 
               Defendants, a Black Lawyer, entourage. Galvin stops.

                                     GALVIN
                              (to Sally)
                         I'm going to do the best I can for 
                         you and your sister. I know what it 
                         means to you. Believe me...
                              (beat)
                         It means that much to me.

               He turns away, walks toward the front of the courtroom, 
               glances toward the jury box.

               ANGLE - P.O.V.

               The Jury, somber, controlled, dignified.

               ANGLE

               Galvin continuing to the defense table, Mickey Morrissey 
               already seated, studying notes on a yellow legal pad. Galvin 
               sits. Mickey looks up.

                                     MICKEY
                         How are you holding up?

                                     GALVIN
                         I'm swell.

                                     MICKEY
                         And all we've got is a witch doctor!

                                     GALVIN
                         Yeah.

               The BAILIFF enters, some SPECTATORS, knowing the routine, 
               start getting to their feet.

                                     MICKEY
                         Look at it this way: it's refreshing 
                         every time a Doctor takes the stand 
                         he's not a Jew.

               We hear the Bailiff's "All rise."

               The COURTROOM getting to its feet as JUDGE WILLIAM B. HOYLE 
               enters.

               The Bailiff, as the Judge sits:

                                     JUDGE
                         Let's begin.

               Galvin gets to his feet. Walks over to the JURY. Looks at 
               them, appraising. He pauses as before a great effort. Takes 
               a breath. Exhales.

                                     GALVIN
                         It's a terrible thing to sit in 
                         judgment. So much rides on it. I 
                         know that you've thought, 'How can I 
                         be pure. How can I be impartial 
                         without being cold. How can I be 
                         merciful and still be just?' And I 
                         know that most of you have said some 
                         sort of prayer this morning to be 
                         helped. To judge correctly. We have 
                         the reputation of two men. Two well 
                         respected doctors and a renowned 
                         hospital before us. And with those 
                         two respected men we have my client, 
                         Deborah Ann Kaye...
                              (beat)
                         ...who was deprived of sight, of 
                         locomotion, hearing, speech, of 
                         everything, in short, which 
                         constitutes her life.
                              (beat)
                         We are going to prove she was deprived 
                         through negligence.
                              (beat)
                         Through the negligence of those 
                         respected men. We will show: One...

               INT. ARCHBISHOP'S HOUSE - CORRIDOR-DAY

               A lavishly appointed corridor. Alito and BILLY, the YOUNG 
               LAWYER from Concannon's office, walking slowly down the 
               corridor.

                                     ALITO
                         Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?

                                     YOUNG LAWYER
                         She's the only nurse who isn't 
                         testifying for the Doctors.

                                     ALITO
                         What did he find?

                                     YOUNG LAWYER
                         Nothing.

                                     ALITO
                         How good's your intelligence?

                                     YOUNG LAWYER
                         Very good.

                                     ALITO
                         And so what is the rest of his case 
                         aside from Dr. Thompson?

                                     YOUNG LAWYER
                         As far as we know, nothing.

               Alito nods, they stop outside a large double door.

                                     ALITO
                         Thank Mr. Concannon for me. Please 
                         tell him I'll see him at his office.

               Alito knocks on the door. The door is opened by a YOUNG 
               PRIEST.

               Alito nods to the Young Lawyer, enters the Bishop's study.

               The door is closed behind him.

               INT. COURTROOM - DAY

               The jury box. One JUROR leans over and makes a whispered 
               comment to another. The SECOND JUROR nods, inclines his head 
               toward the witness box.

               ANGLE

               DR. Thompson on the stand. Composed, waiting. Concannon 
               consulting his notes.

                                     CONCANNON
                         Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, 
                         you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye. 
                         Is that correct?

                                     DR. THOMPSON
                         That is correct. I was engaged to 
                         render an opinion.

                                     CONCANNON
                         Engaged to render an opinion. For a 
                         price. Is that correct? You're being 
                         paid to be here today?

                                     DR. THOMPSON
                         Just as you are, Sir...

                                     CONCANNON
                         Are you board-certified in 
                         anesthesiology, Doctor?

                                     DR. THOMPSON
                         No, I am not. It's quite common in 
                         New York State...

                                     CONCANNON
                         ...I'm sure it is, but this is 
                         Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in 
                         Internal Medicine?

                                     DR. THOMPSON
                         No.

                                     DR. THOMPSON
                         No.

                                     DR. THOMPSON
                         I'm just an M.D.

                                     CONCANNON
                         Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?

                                     DR. THOMPSON
                         I know of him.

                                     CONCANNON
                         How is that?

                                     DR. THOMPSON
                         Through, through his book.

                                     CONCANNON
                         What book is that?

                                     DR. THOMPSON
                         Meth... Methodology and Technique...

                                     CONCANNON
                         ...of Anesthesiology?

                                     DR. THOMPSON
                         'Methodology and Techniques of 
                         Anesthesiology.' Yes.

                                     CONCANNON
                         How old are you?

                                     DR. THOMPSON
                         I am seventy-four years old.

                                     CONCANNON
                         Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of 
                         medicine?

                                     DR. THOMPSON
                         I'm on the staff of...

                                     CONCANNON
                         Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you 
                         testify quite a bit against other 
                         physicians? Isn't that right? You, 
                         you're available for that? When you're 
                         paid to be there?

                                     DR. THOMPSON
                         Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong... 
                         as in this case, I am available. I 
                         am seventy-four years old, I am not 
                         board-certified.

                                     DR. THOMPSON
                         I have been practicing medicine for 
                         forty-six years and I know when an 
                         injustice has been done.

                                     CONCANNON
                         Do you, indeed. I'll bet you do. 
                         Fine. Fine. We'll save the court the 
                         time. We will admit the Doctor as an 
                         'expert witness,' fine.

               Concannon sits.

                                     JUDGE
                              (in undertone, to 
                              Bailiff)
                         Do we have time this morning to...
                              (glances at watch, 
                              Bailiff nods to him)
                         All right. Mr. Galvin, you want to 
                         continue now, or we can resume with 
                         Dr. Thompson this afternoon.

                                     GALVIN
                              (rising)
                         Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue. 
                         Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah 
                         Ann Kaye last night at The Northern 
                         Chronic Care Facility?

                                     DR. THOMPSON
                         I did.

                                     CONCANNON
                         Objection.

                                     JUDGE
                         Sustained. Yes. The witness will 
                         confine his testimony to review of 
                         the hospital records.

                                     GALVIN
                         What?

                                     JUDGE
                              (patronizing)
                         I believe that's the law... is it 
                         not, Mr. Galvin...?

               A beat.

                                     GALVIN
                         Dr. Thompson. From your review of 
                         the hospital records of May twelfth 
                         nineteen seventy-six.

                                     GALVIN
                         In your opinion, what happened to 
                         Deborah Ann Kaye?

                                     DR. THOMPSON
                         Cardiac arrest. During delivery her 
                         heart stopped. When the heart stops 
                         the brain's deprived of oxygen. You 
                         get brain damage. That is why she's 
                         in the state she's in today.

                                     GALVIN
                         Now, Dr. Towler's testified that 
                         they restored the heartbeat within 
                         three or four minutes. In your opinion 
                         is his estimate correct?

                                     DR. THOMPSON
                         It's my opinion it took him much 
                         longer. Nine... ten minutes. There's 
                         too much brain damage.

               The Judge leans over.

                                     JUDGE
                              (to Dr. Thompson)
                         Are you saying that a failure to 
                         restore the heartbeat within nine 
                         minutes in itself constitutes bad 
                         medical practice?

                                     DR. THOMPSON
                         Well...

                                     GALVIN
                         Your Honor!

               He has shouted unconsciously; the whole Courtroom turns to 
               look at him.

                                     JUDGE
                         Yes, Mr. Galvin?

                                     GALVIN
                         If I may be permitted to question my 
                         own witness in my own way...

                                     JUDGE
                         I'd just like to get to the point, 
                         Mr. Galvin. Let's not waste these 
                         people's time. Answer the question, 
                         Mr. Witness. Please. Would a nine 
                         minute lapse in restoring the 
                         heartbeat in and of itself be 
                         negligence?

                                     DR. THOMPSON
                         I... in that small context I would 
                         have... I would have to say 'no.'

                                     JUDGE
                         Then you're saying there's no 
                         negligence, based on my question?

                                     DR. THOMPSON
                         I... given the limits of your 
                         question, that's correct.

                                     JUDGE
                         The Doctors were not negligent.

                                     DR. THOMPSON
                              (beat)
                         I... um...

               The Judge shrugs, meaning, "Well then what in the hell are 
               we doing here?"

               ANGLE

               Galvin, furious.

               ANGLE

               The Judge and Witness.

                                     JUDGE
                         Thank you.

               The Witness starts to step down. Galvin strides over to him 
               and speaks to the Judge.

                                     GALVIN
                         I'm not through with the witness, 
                         your Honor. With all due respect if 
                         you are going to try my case for me 
                         I would appreciate it if you wouldn't 
                         lose it.

               The Judge stands, furious.

                                     JUDGE
                         Thank you. I think that's enough for 
                         this morning. I'll see the Plaintiff's 
                         Counsel in my chambers. Now, please.

               The Courtroom rises. The Bailiff is heard, "All rise, court 
               is adjourned until one o'clock."

               INT. JUDGE SWEENEY'S CHAMBERS - DAY

               Galvin, furious, standing against the wall. The Judge comes 
               in from his own entrance, shucking his robe. Equally angry.

                                     JUDGE
                         I got a letter from the Judge 
                         Advocate's office on you today, fella, 
                         you're on your way out... They should 
                         have kicked you out on that 
                         Lillibridge case. Now this is it 
                         today.

                                     GALVIN
                         I'm an attorney on trial before the 
                         bar. Representing my client. My 
                         client, do you understand? You open 
                         your mouth and you're losing my case 
                         for me.

                                     JUDGE
                         Listen to me, fella...

                         No, no, you listen to me. All I wanted 
                         in this case is an even shake. You 
                         rushed me into court in five days... 
                         my star witness disappears, I can't 
                         get a continuance, and I don't give 
                         a damn. I'm going up there and I'm 
                         going to try it. Let the Jury decide. 
                         They told me Sweeney he's a hard-
                         ass, he's a defendant's judge. I 
                         don't care. I said, the hell with 
                         it. The hell with it. I'll take my 
                         chances he'll be fair.

               Galvin is pacing. Beat.

                                     JUDGE
                              (conciliatory)
                         Galvin, look, many years ago...

                                     GALVIN
                         And don't give me this shit, 'I was 
                         a lawyer, too.' 'Cause I know who 
                         you were. You couldn't hack it as a 
                         lawyer. You were Bag Man for the 
                         Boys and you still are. I know who 
                         you are.

                                     JUDGE
                              (beat; barely 
                              controlling anger)
                         Are you done?

                                     GALVIN
                         Damn right I'm done. I'm going to 
                         ask for a mistrial and I'm going to 
                         request that you disqualify yourself 
                         from sitting on this case. I'm going 
                         to take a transcript to the State 
                         and ask that they impeach your ass.

                                     JUDGE
                         You aren't going to get a mistrial, 
                         boy. We're going back this afternoon, 
                         we're going to try this case to an 
                         end. Now you get out of here before 
                         I call the Bailiff and have you thrown 
                         in jail.

               INT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS CORRIDOR-DAY

               Galvin walking down the corridor, having just come from the 
               Judge's Chambers. Sally Doneghy comes up to him.

                                     SALLY
                         What does it mean?
                              (beat)
                         I... I mean we, you have other 
                         tactics...

                                     GALVIN
                         We, yes. Yes. They, they present 
                         their side, and I get the same chance. 
                         To cross-examine... to... to...

                                     SALLY
                         Are we going to win?
                              (beat, desperately 
                              needing to trust)
                         We have, you know, other tactics, 
                         though...

                                     GALVIN
                         Yes.

               She nods. Beat. Walks off. Galvin turns to the open door to 
               the Courtroom, through which the SPECTATORS are reentering 
               for the afternoon session. Mickey is standing by the door, 
               he catches Galvin's eye. They look at each other a moment.

               INT. COURTROOM - DAY

               Dr. Towler on the witness stand. Concannon walking away from 
               him.

                                     CONCANNON
                         No further questions.

               ANGLE

               Galvin at the Plaintiff's table, hastily scribbling notes, 
               he looks up. Gets to his feet, walks over to Dr. Towler in 
               the witness box, the CAMERA MOVES WITH him.

                                     GALVIN
                         Dr. Towler...

                                     TOWLER
                         Yes.

                                     GALVIN
                         You have a record of what happened 
                         in the operating room...

                                     TOWLER
                         Yes, that's correct.

                                     GALVIN
                         ...there are notations every thirty 
                         seconds...

                                     TOWLER
                         Yes.

                                     GALVIN
                         ...of the procedures...

                                     TOWLER
                         Yes, the roving nurse...

                                     GALVIN
                         But those notations stop...
                              (consults notes)
                         ...Four-and-one-half minutes after 
                         Deborah Ann Kaye's...

                                     TOWLER
                         We, we were rather busy...

                                     GALVIN
                         Four-and-one-half minutes after her 
                         heart stopped.
                              (beat)
                         And they resume seven minutes...

                                     TOWLER
                         As I've said we had some more...

                                     GALVIN
                         ...they start again three minutes 
                         earlier...

                                     TOWLER
                         We had rather more important things 
                         on our mind than taking notes.
                              (beat)
                         We were trying to restore her...

                         What happened in those three...

                                     TOWLER
                         ...we were trying to restore her 
                         heartbeat.

                                     GALVIN
                         What happened in those three 
                         minutes...?

                                     TOWLER
                              (beat; controls himself)

                         Why did it take that long to get her 
                         heartbeat...

                                     CONCANNON (V.O.)
                         Objection, we've...

                                     GALVIN
                         ...to get her heartbeat back...?

                                     CONCANNON (V.O.)
                         We've touched on this, his own witness 
                         has said...

                                     GALVIN
                              (overriding him)
                         ...almost nine minutes... causing 
                         brain damage.

                                     CONCANNON
                         Your Honor...! Your Honor...

                                     TOWLER
                         Brain damage could have been... it 
                         didn't necessarily take nine minutes, 
                         it could have been caused in two...

                                     GALVIN
                         Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that 
                         her brain damage could have been 
                         caused by her being deprived of oxygen 
                         for two minutes...?

                                     TOWLER
                         Yes.

                                     GALVIN
                              (contemptuous)
                         Huh. And why is that?

                                     TOWLER
                         Because she was anemic.
                              (beat)
                         It's right there on her chart. Her 
                         brain was getting less oxygen 
                         anyway...

               Galvin is struck dumb. He has just made a terrible error.

               He looks at Mickey.

               ANGLE - P.O.V. Mickey looks at Galvin. He shakes his head 
               sadly.

               INT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - DR. THOMPSON - DUSK

               The last of the spectators coming out of the court. Galvin 
               and Dr. Thompson are standing there.

                                     DR. THOMPSON
                         I didn't do too well for you.

                                     GALVIN
                         No, you did fine.

                                     DR. THOMPSON
                         I'm afraid that's not true.
                              (beat)
                         Will you want me to stay on till 
                         Monday?

                                     GALVIN
                         No. No thank you, Doctor. You go 
                         home.

                                     DR. THOMPSON
                         You know... sometimes people can 
                         surprise you. Sometimes they have a 
                         great capacity to hear the truth.

                                     GALVIN
                         Yes... I... yes.

               They shake hands. Dr. Thompson walks off. Stops.

                                     DR. THOMPSON
                         You sure you don't want me to stay 
                         on.

                                     GALVIN
                         No. No. Thank you. You go home.

               Mickey walks out of the courtroom arranging papers in his 
               briefcase.

                                     MICKEY
                         I'm going back to the office.

               He walks off leaving Galvin standing there alone. Laura comes 
               out of the courtroom. Tentatively, she looks around.

               Comes up to him.

               EXT. COURTHOUSE - STREET - DUSK

               Laura and Galvin walking.

                                     LAURA
                         Is it over?

                                     GALVIN
                         No.

                                     LAURA
                         What are you going to do?

                                     GALVIN
                         I don't have a goddamned idea.

               INT. GALVIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Galvin pacing. Mickey seated. Morose.

                                     GALVIN
                         Okay. What do you do when you don't 
                         have a witness?

                                     MICKEY
                              (reciting a catechism; 
                              dispiritedly)
                         You use their witness.

                                     GALVIN
                         That's right.

                                     MICKEY
                         I think we tried that. The case is 
                         over.

               Galvin continues pacing. He will not hear what was just said.

                                     MICKEY
                         And how the fuck... You broke the 
                         first law that they taught you in 
                         law school. You never ask a question 
                         you don't know the answer to.
                              (beat)
                         Frankie, wake up. You got your own 
                         expert witness says there was no 
                         negligence. It's over. Period. 
                         There'll be no other cases...

               Galvin turns on him, animal-like.

                                     GALVIN
                         There are no other cases. This is 
                         the case.

                         I know how you feel. I know you don't 
                         believe me, but I do. I'm going to 
                         tell you something I learned when I 
                         was your age. I had prepared a case. 
                         Mr. White asked me, 'How did you 
                         do.'
                              (beat)
                         I said, 'I've done my best.' He said, 
                         'They don't pay you to do your best. 
                         They pay you to win.'
                              (beat)
                         That's what pays for this office.
                              (beat)
                         And that's what pays for the pro 
                         bono work that we do for the poor. 
                         And for the kind of law that you 
                         want to practice. And that's what 
                         pays for your clothes and my whiskey, 
                         and the leisure that we have to sit 
                         back and discuss philosophy.

                         You finished your marriage. You wanted 
                         to come back and practice law. You 
                         wanted to come back to the world.

               tired, enters the corridor from the side and proceeds away 
               from the CAMERA. The CAMERA FOLLOWS her to her door. She 
               stops, takes out her key, tiredly opens the door.

               INT. LAURA'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Laura opening the door, looks down, sees something, bends

               Laura closes the door behind her, she does not turn on the 
               light, walks over to a couch by the window, sits down, all 
               the while reading the paper by the outside light. She lowers 
               the paper to her lap.

               ANGLE - INSERT

                         Why doesn't Mary Rooney testify?

               Mickey shakes his head.

                         she protecting?

               Galvin flips through his notes. Reads.

                         Who? They're all testifying. Everybody 
                         who was in the O.R.'s going to take 
                         the stand.

                         What difference can that make...? 
                         All right...

               He starts checking the charts. Sighs. "This is useless..."

                         She didn't do anything. She took the

                         What are you talking about?

               Galvin turns, confused. Goes back to her. Warmly,

               A beat.

               Mary Rooney motions the other Nurse to go away. She steps 
               closer to Galvin.

                         I spoke to her, and everything is

                         I, what are you talking about? I 
                         talked to her this morning, and she 
                         said...

                         Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in 
                         Records. We're looking for Kathy 
                         Costello...

                              (voice over; in the 
                              other room, shouting)
                         I need a cigarette!
                              (resumes on-the-phone 
                              tone)
                         She left my office four years ago, 
                         we're looking for a chart...

                              shouts)
                         I need a cigarette...

               Laura looks around the desk, picks up one then another pack, 
               crushes them, empty. She nods to herself, picks up her coat 
               off the couch in the anteroom, and starts down the hall.

               Going through the door, she turns, looks back.

               ANGLE - P.O.V.

               Galvin in the inner office, on the phone.

                         Thank you. I'll hold.

               He looks up. Sees Laura, gives her a half-smile.

               INT. GREASY SPOON - NIGHT

               Near the cash register of an all-night diner in the business 
               district, the deserted streets outside. Laura -- standing 
               next to a wall phone, exhausted. She is handed a cardboard 
               tray with three coffees on it and two packs of Pall Malls 
               and some change by the Proprietor. She takes the change and 
               turns her head to look at the telephone.

               INT. GALVIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Mickey asleep on the couch, coffee containers around him, an 
               ashtray full of butts. Beat. We hear a telephone being dialed.

               ANGLE

               Galvin, exhausted, smoking, on the telephone.

                                     GALVIN
                         Hello. This is Ross Williams. I'm 
                         calling from California. I'm sorry. 
                         I know it's late in the East, but 
                         this is an emergency. May I please 
                         speak to Kathy Costello?
                              (beat)
                         I'm sorry. My records must be 
                         confused. This is the family of Kathy 
                         Costello...? Please excuse it.

               He hangs up. Reaches for a bottle of whiskey on his desk.

               Pours a shot into a glass. Downs it. His attention is caught 
               by something across the room.

               ANGLE - P.O.V.

               Laura asleep on the couch, covered in Galvin's overcoat.

               INT. GALVIN'S OFFICE - VESTIBULE - DAY

               A small bundle of mail is pushed through the vertical slot 
               and falls to the floor.

               ANGLE

               Interior office. Early morning. Galvin asleep with his head 
               on his desk. Mickey asleep in a chair. Laura asleep on the 
               couch, covered with Galvin's overcoat. Galvin wakes up, 
               startled by the sound of the mail dropping. He picks up the 
               phone mechanically. He realizes it is morning and he has 
               been asleep. He replaces phone. He surveys the office.

               Dead, resigned. He closes the phone book. He reaches in a 
               pack of cigarettes on the desk. It is empty. He roots in the 
               ashtray for a long butt. This disgusts him. He rejects it. 
               Rubs his eyes. Gets up. Goes to the window, stares out. Looks 
               back at the scene in his office. It is over.

               He stands by Laura and looks down at her, he looks at Mickey.

               He has let them down. He goes to a cabinet under the lawbooks 
               and takes out a bottle of whiskey and a water glass. He walks 
               into the anteroom. Sighs, sits on the couch near the door. 
               Glances at the several letters that have just fallen through 
               the slot. He pours a half-tumbler full of whiskey, and drains 
               it. He refills the tumbler. He absently picks up the mail 
               and starts mechanically sorting through it. He stops at an 
               official-looking piece.

               ANGLE - P.O.V.

               The letter, return address MASSACHUSETTS BAR ASSOCIATION. 
               URGENT.

               He lethargically opens the letter. On Bar Association 
               letterhead, it reads: "You are directed to appear on January 
               15th to show cause why you should not be disbarred. You are 
               permitted to be represented by counsel of your choice, and..."

               ANGLE

               Galvin reading the letter. He crumbles it and throws it into 
               the wastebasket. He looks at the next letter and skims it 
               into the wastebasket. He looks at the next letter and stops.

               ANGLE - P.O.V.

               It is a phone bill.

               Galvin straightens, looks around the vestibule, takes heavy 
               letter opener from his jacket pocket and pries open the Rooney 
               mailbox. He extracts letters and rifles through them.

               Mickey has woken up. Swings his feet to the floor. Picks up

               Comes up with a pack of cigarettes. He sees something in the 
               purse. Stops.

               black: "CONFIDENTIAL. EYES ONLY!!!" Mickey takes out the

               haunts, habits, and is heavily notated in various types of

                         Four. You're great with these kids.

               She beams, caught unprepared in something that is a great 
               point of pride with her.

                                     KATHY

                              something)
                         You, are you the one they told me 
                         was the nurse?

                                     KATHY
                         Who told you that?

                                     GALVIN
                              (gestures back at the 
                              office, vaguely)
                         Mrs...

                                     KATHY
                         Mrs. Simmonds.

                                     GALVIN
                         Yes.

                                     KATHY
                              (very serious, correct)
                         I used to be a nurse.

                                     GALVIN
                         That's a wonderful profession. My 
                         daughter-in-law's a nurse. What did 
                         you do, stop?

               Kathy is lost in thought. This is obviously a very painful 
               subject for her. Beat.

                                     KATHY
                         Yes.

               Galvin, getting involved in a serious conversation, takes 
               off his overcoat, he is going to stay awhile.

                                     GALVIN
                         How come you stopped?

               She is traumatized by the question. The casual conversation 
               has become immediate and painful. She opens her mouth to 
               speak, then stops, staring at Galvin. He doesn't know what 
               she is staring at... something on his jacket. He looks down.

               ANGLE - KATHY'S P.O.V.

               The shuttle ticket, BOSTON - NEW YORK, stuck in the lapel 
               pocket of Galvin's suitcoat.

               ANGLE

               Kathy and Galvin. She realizes why he is there. She starts 
               to cry quietly.

                                     GALVIN
                              (beat; gently dropping 
                              his pretense)
                         Will you help me?

               INT. NEW YORK HOTEL RESTAURANT -DAY

               The restaurant fairly deserted after the lunch crowd. Empty 
               tables -- crisp linen, Laura alone at a table, watching the 
               door, an untouched cup of coffee in front of her.

               EXT. NEW YORK HOTEL - DAY

               The doorman opens the door of a cab.

               ANGLE

               Mickey Morrissey standing in an alcove under the marquee, 
               looking out at the street.

               ANGLE - P.O.V.

               The street. Pedestrians. Joe Galvin comes walking hurriedly, 
               smiling, down the street.

               ANGLE

               Mickey starting down the steps, intercepts Galvin. Galvin 
               looks up, surprised.

                                     GALVIN
                         What the hell are you doing here?

                                     MICKEY
                         We got to talk.

               He is moving Galvin off down the sidewalk, away from the 
               Hotel. CAMERA STAYS STILL, and their voices get fainter as 
               they move away.

                                     GALVIN
                         What are you doing in New York...?

                                     MICKEY
                         Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...

               They continue walking. We cannot hear them. Galvin is becoming 
               agitated. He stops Mickey, stands there, Mickey very sad, 
               Galvin incredulous, talking to him. Mickey nods.

               Galvin starts hurriedly back down the street toward the Hotel.

               INT. NEW YORK HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY

               LONG SHOT of Laura seated at a table alone.

               ANGLE

               Galvin at the entrance to the restaurant looking at her. He 
               walks over to her slowly.

               ANGLE - CLOSEUP

               Laura, looks up, sees him, smiles. Her smile fades, she sees 
               that he knows.

               ANGLE

               Laura getting up from the table. We SEE her back, and Galvin 
               approaching. We SEE her shoulders droop, beaten. He draws 
               closer. Galvin comes up to her, his face a mask of pain and 
               confusion. She sighs, starts to speak. Stops. Beat. They 
               look at each other -- he starts to speak, cannot. He knocks 
               her to the floor, she upsets the table. A large man at the 
               next table starts to restrain Galvin.

                                     LAURA
                              (as if in shock)
                         It's all right... it's all right... 
                         it's all right... it's all right...

               INT. EASTERN SHUTTLE PLANE - NIGHT

               Galvin and Mickey seated next to him, flying home in silence.

               Mickey smoking a cigarette. Galvin stone-faced, beat.

                                     MICKEY
                         I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar 
                         Association.
                              (beat)
                         The broad used to work for one of 
                         Concannon's partners in New York 
                         awhile ago.
                              (beat; lamely)
                         She wanted to move to Boston.
                              (beat)
                         How badly did she hurt us, Joe?

                                     GALVIN
                         I don't know.

               A beat.

                                     MICKEY
                         We got a mistrial, you know. Joe -- 
                         did you hear what I said...?

                                     GALVIN
                         I don't want a mistrial.

               INT. MICKEY MORRISSEY'S HOUSE - DAY

               The doorway to his study. A basketball game dimly SEEN in 
               the half-light. Mickey, o.s.:

                                     MICKEY
                         He's not here.
                              (pause)
                         Yeah. I don't know when.
                              (pause)
                         All right.

               Sound of him hanging up a telephone. He enters the frame 
               carrying a bottle of booze, goes through door into study.

               CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM INTO THE ROOM. THE TV:

                                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         The Knicks are pressing hard...
                              (etc.)

               He sits on a sofa opposite the television. Watches the game 
               a beat. Opens the fresh bottle of whiskey and pours a large 
               shot into the almost-empty glass in front of him. Looks to 
               his left. Reaches behind him to some glasses on a shelf, 
               takes one down, pours drink into the new glass, leans to his 
               left, CAMERA MOVES WITH him, and we SEE Galvin sitting in a 
               deep leather armchair, staring. Mickey offers him the drink.

               Galvin becomes aware of him, shakes his head "no." Beat.

               Mickey moves back into his seat, they both stare at the 
               television.

               INT. COURTROOM -- JUDGE'S P.O.V. - DAY

               Half full of spectators.

               ANGLE

               Galvin gets up from Plaintiff's table, takes up a large book 
               as Dr. Towler takes the stands. He reads:

                                     GALVIN
                         Dr. Towler; page 406, 
                         'Contraindications to general 
                         anesthetic. Ideally a patient should 
                         refrain from taking nourishment up 
                         to nine hours prior to induction of 
                         general anesthetic.' Does that sound 
                         familiar?

                                     DR. TOWLER
                         Yes. I wrote it.

               Galvin shows the book.

                                     GALVIN
                         'Practice and Methodology in 
                         Anaesthesia.' General textbook on 
                         the subject. Is that correct?

                                     DR. TOWLER
                         I. Yes. It is.

                                     GALVIN
                         And you wrote that...

                                     DR. TOWLER
                         Yes.

                                     GALVIN
                              (reading)
                         ...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken 
                         nourishment within one hour prior to 
                         inducement, general anesthetic should 
                         be avoided at all costs because of 
                         the grave risk the patient will 
                         aspirate food particles into his 
                         mask.' Is that what happened to 
                         Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into 
                         her mask?

                                     DR. TOWLER
                         She threw up in her mask, yes. But 
                         she hadn't eaten one hour prior to 
                         admission.

                                     GALVIN
                         If she had eaten, say one hour prior 
                         to admission, the inducement of a 
                         general anesthetic... the type you 
                         gave her... would have been 
                         negligent...?

                                     DR. TOWLER
                         Negligent. Yes... it would have been 
                         criminal. But that was not the case.

                                     GALVIN
                         Thank you.

               Galvin signals he is done. The Judge signals Dr. Towler to 
               leave the stand, which he does.

                                     JUDGE
                         Mr. Concannon...?

               ANGLE

               Kathy at the back of the court, coming down the aisle. As 
               she passes the Defendant's table, Towler grabs Marx and starts 
               whispering frantically. Concannon looks on, ignorant of what 
               is happening. We hear Dr. Towler's "Oh, my God..."

               ANGLE

               Galvin surveys the courtroom, Kathy crosses in front of him, 
               takes the stand, we hear the Bailiff administering the formula 
               as we WATCH Galvin turn and look at the Jurors.

                         are about to give will be the truth,

                         ...whole truth and nothing but the

                         Be seated.

               Kathy sits, the Bailiff retires, Galvin walks over to her.

               She looks closely at it. Is satisfied.

                         name.

               A beat.

                                     GALVIN
                         D'you ask the patient when did she 
                         last eat?

                                     KATHY
                         Yes.

                                     GALVIN
                         What did she say?

                                     KATHY
                         She said she had a full meal one 
                         hour before coming to the hospital.

                                     GALVIN
                         One hour.

                                     KATHY
                         Yes.

                                     GALVIN
                         And did you write the numeral 'one' 
                         down on the record, standing for one 
                         hour?

                                     KATHY
                         I did.

                                     GALVIN
                         A single hour.

                                     KATHY
                         Yes.

               Galvin walks away from the witness box. He looks at the jury. 
               He turns to look at the spectators. His thoughts are a million 
               miles away. Unconsciously he straightens his tie.

               ANGLE

               Galvin in front of the dead-still courtroom. He breaks his 
               reverie.

                                     GALVIN
                              (to Concannon)
                         Your witness.

               Concannon is on his feet as Galvin walks back to his table.

               Concannon walks over to Kathy and begins forcefully:

                                     CONCANNON
                         You are aware of the penalties for 
                         perjury...?

                                     KATHY
                         It's a crime.

                                     CONCANNON
                         Yes.
                              (beat)
                         It is a crime. A serious crime.

                                     KATHY
                         I wouldn't do it.

                                     CONCANNON
                         You would not...?

                                     KATHY
                         No.

                                     CONCANNON
                         In fact, you've just taken an oath 
                         that you would not commit perjury. 
                         You've just sworn to that. Isn't 
                         that right?

                                     KATHY
                         Yes.

                                     CONCANNON
                         Just now...

                                     KATHY
                         Yes.

                                     CONCANNON
                         ...sworn before God you would tell 
                         the truth?

                                     KATHY
                              (beat)
                         Yes.

                                     CONCANNON
                         Now. I'd like to ask you something: 
                         four years ago, when you were working 
                         as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. 
                         Towler and Marx based their treatment 
                         of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart 
                         that you signed...?

                                     KATHY
                         I...

                                     CONCANNON
                         And wasn't that an oath...? These 
                         are your initials here: K.C. When 
                         you signed this chart you took an 
                         oath. No less important than that 
                         which you took today.
                              (beat)
                         Isn't that right?
                              (beat)
                         Isn't that right...?

                                     KATHY
                         I... yes.

                                     CONCANNON
                         Then, please, which is correct? You've 
                         sworn today the patient ate one hour 
                         ago. Four years ago you swore she 
                         ate nine hours ago? Which is the 
                         lie. When were you lying?

                                     KATHY
                         I...

                                     CONCANNON
                         You know these doctors could have 
                         settled out of court. They wanted a 
                         trial. They wanted to clear their 
                         names.

                                     GALVIN
                         Objection!

                                     CONCANNON
                         And you would come here, and on a 
                         slip of memory four years ago, you'd 
                         ruin their lives.

                                     KATHY
                         They lied.

                                     CONCANNON
                         'They lied.' Indeed! When did they 
                         lie? And do you know what a lie is?

                                     KATHY
                         I do. Yes.

                                     CONCANNON
                              (holding chart)
                         You swore on this form that the 
                         patient ate nine hours ago.

                                     KATHY
                         That's not my handwriting.

                                     CONCANNON
                         You've just said you signed it.

                                     KATHY
                         Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But 
                         I, I didn't write that figure.

                                     CONCANNON
                         You didn't write that figure. And 
                         how is it that you remember that so 
                         clearly after four years?

                                     KATHY
                              (taking a paper out 
                              of her purse)
                         Because I kept a copy. I have it 
                         right here.

               She looks toward Galvin.

               ANGLE

               Galvin nods, meaning, "You did it perfectly."

               ANGLE

               Concannon, the Judge, Kathy.

                                     CONCANNON
                         Objection! This is ri... expect us 
                         to accept a photocopy, we have the 
                         original right...

                                     JUDGE
                         I'll rule on that presently.
                              (beat)
                         Proceed.

               Concannon is taken up short. Amazed at the Judge's reaction, 
               he pauses an instant.

                                     JUDGE
                         Please proceed.

               Concannon motions to Billy, the young lawyer, who nods in 
               response and starts whispering instructions to his colleagues 
               at the Defense table, who start leafing through their 
               lawbooks. Concannon takes up the fight again.

                                     CONCANNON
                         ...what in the world would induce 
                         you to make a photocopy of some 
                         obscure record and hold it four years? 
                         This is a... why? Why would you do 
                         that?

                                     KATHY
                         I thought I would need it.

                                     CONCANNON
                         And why, please tell us, would you 
                         think that?

                                     KATHY
                         After, after the operation, when 
                         that poor girl, she went in a coma. 
                         Dr. Towler called me in. He told me 
                         he had five difficult deliveries in 
                         a row and he was tired, and he never 
                         looked at the admittance form.
                              (beat)
                         And he told me to change the form. 
                         He told me to change the one to a 
                         nine.
                              (beat)
                         Or else, or else, he said...
                              (beat; starts to cry)
                         He said he'd fire me. He said I'd 
                         never work again... Who were these 
                         men...? Who were these men...? I 
                         wanted to be a nurse...

               She is weeping copiously. A beat. She starts to get herself 
               under control.

                                     CONCANNON
                         No further questions.

                                     JUDGE
                         You may step down.

               Beat. Kathy starts to get down. She looks to Galvin for 
               assurance. Galvin nods at her.

                                     JUDGE
                         Mr. Galvin...?

               ANGLE

               Kathy getting down from the stand. The Judge addressing 
               Galvin.

                                     GALVIN
                         Nothing further, your Honor...

                                     JUDGE
                         Mr. Concannon...?

               Concannon is signalled by Billy, the young lawyer at the 
               Defense table, who is gathering notes from his colleagues, 
               who have been researching during Kathy's speech.

               Concannon walks over to the table and is quickly "talked 
               through" the notes by Billy.

                                     JUDGE
                         Mr. Concannon.

               Concannon cuts Billy short, meaning, "Yes, I understand, I'm 
               far ahead of you," he takes the notes and returns to the 
               bench.

                                     CONCANNON
                         Thank you, your Honor. We object to 
                         the copy of the admissions form as 
                         incompetent and essentially hearsay 
                         evidence and cite McGee versus State 
                         of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 
                         through 25 of the Uniform Code: 'The 
                         admission of a duplicate document in 
                         preference to an existing original 
                         must presuppose the possibility of 
                         alteration and so must be disallowed.' 
                         And, your Honor, having given the 
                         Plaintiff the leeway we would like 
                         your ruling on this issue now: we 
                         object to the admission of the Xerox 
                         form.

                                     JUDGE
                         ...one moment, Mr. Concannon...

               The Judge nods, meaning, "I am considering..."

               ANGLE

               The Judge. He is making some notations on a page in front of 
               him. He nods to himself, he has reached a decision. He looks 
               up.

                                     JUDGE
                         The document is disallowed, the jury 
                         will be advised not to consider the 
                         testimony of Kathy Costello regarding

                         Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. 
                         Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a 
                         'Surprise Witness' she may only serve 
                         to rebut direct testimony. As her 
                         only evidentiary rebuttal was the 
                         admitting form, which has been 
                         disallowed I request that her entire 
                         testimony be disallowed and the jury 
                         advised that they must totally 
                         disregard her appearance here.

                                     JUDGE
                         I'm going to uphold that.

                         Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness. 
                         Her sole rebuttal was the document,

                         Her entire testimony must be stricken 
                         from the record. You shouldn't have 
                         heard it, but you did. Now, that was 
                         my mistake... and you must strike it 
                         from your minds, give it no weight.

               Galvin takes a sheet of legal paper and starts writing on

                         You know, so much of the time we're 
                         lost. We say, 'Please, God, tell us 
                         what is right. Tell us what's true. 
                         There is no justice. The rich win, 
                         the poor are powerless...' We become 
                         tired of hearing people lie. After a 
                         time we become dead. A little dead. 
                         We start thinking of ourselves as 
                         victims.
                              (pause)
                         And we become victims.
                              (pause)
                         And we become weak... and doubt 
                         ourselves, and doubt our 
                         institutions... and doubt our 
                         beliefs... we say for example, 'The 
                         law is a sham... there is no law... 
                         I was a fool for having believed 
                         there was.'
                              (beat)
                         But today you are the law. You are 
                         the law... And not some book and not 
                         the lawyers, or the marble statues 
                         and the trappings of the court... 
                         all that they are is symbols.
                              (beat)
                         Of our desire to be just...

                         All that they are, in effect, is a

                              (beat)

                         In my religion we say, 'Act as if 
                         you had faith, and faith will be 
                         given to you.'
                              (beat)
                         If... If we would have faith in 
                         justice, we must only believe in 
                         ourselves.
                              (beat)
                         And act with justice.
                              (beat)
                         And I believe that there is justice 
                         in our hearts.

          WALTER VALE, sixty-two, is standing by the window of his
          modestly furnished Colonial house. He is holding a glass of
          wine and peering out through the drapes.
          
          After a few moments an OLD CAR pulls up. A slightly
          overweight WOMAN gets out of the car. She starts to walk up
          to the house.
          
          Walter steps back from the window and waits. The doorbell
          rings. Walter takes a last sip of wine and sets the glass
          down on the end table. And then he goes to the door and opens
          it.

          She steps into the house and Walter shuts the door. They both
          stand there awkwardly. Barbara is tightly wound and
          overcompensates with a forced pleasantness.

          Walter starts to play the piano. It's a lesson in progress.
          They are sitting at a beautiful GRAND PIANO but Walter is
          only a beginner. And not a very good beginner.

                    It's something that I tell my kids.
                    If you curve your fingers like
                    this...
                        (She demonstrates)
                    Then the train can pass through the
                    tunnel.
          
          She passes her pencil through her curved fingers. Walter
          looks at her for a long moment.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S HOUSE - DAY
          
          Walter walks Barbara to the front door. He opens it and then
          hands Barbara some money.

                               WALTER
                    Here.
          
                              BARBARA
                    Thank you. Next Tuesday at the same
                    time?
          
                              WALTER
                    No. I don't think I'm going to
                    continue with our lessons.
          
                              BARBARA
                    Oh, no. Are you giving up?
          
                               WALTER
                    No.
          
          Barbara gets the point. He is stopping with her, not the
          lessons.
          
                              BARBARA
                    Oh. OK. Goodbye.
          
                               WALTER
                    Goodbye.
          
          Barbara walks out the door and then turns before Walter shuts
          it.
          
                              BARBARA
                    Mr. Vale? If I may ask, how many
                    teachers have you had before me?
          
                               WALTER
                    Four.
          
                              BARBARA
                    Well, for what it's worth, it's
                    difficult to learn an instrument at
                    your age. Especially if you don't
                    possess a natural gift for it. I'm
                    not saying this to be mean. But if
                    you do decide to give up then I
                    would really like to buy your
                    piano. It's a beautiful instrument.
          
          Walter nods, not quite sure how to receive the comment.
          
                               BARBARA (CONT'D)
                    Goodbye.
          
          Barbara turns and leaves. Walter shuts the door.

          INT. CONNECTICUT COLLEGE, LECTURE HALL - DAY
          
          Walter stands before a half-empty class. He is wrapping up a
          lecture on economic theory. There is nothing inspiring about
          it.
          
                              WALTER
                    East Asia's experience is really
                    the exception to the rule, because
                    the conditions there that made
                    trade liberalization for the Middle
                    East successful weren't present in
                    the developing countries in sub-
                    Saharan Africa, and in Central and
                    South America.
          
          
          EXT. CONNECTICUT COLLEGE, CAMPUS - DAY
          
          Walter walks across the campus.
          
          
          INT. CONNECTICUT COLLEGE, CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter sits in a meeting with seven other COLLEAGUES.
          
          
          INT. CONNECTICUT COLLEGE, WALTER'S OFFICE - LATER
          
          Walter is staring out the window in his simple but very lived-
          in office. Classical music plays softly in the background. A
          knock at the door.
          
                               WALTER
                    Come in.
          
          A STUDENT opens the door and enters.
          
                               STUDENT
                    Hi.
          
          He sits down and sets a paper on the desk.
          
                              STUDENT (CONT'D)
                    Sorry it's late.
          
                              WALTER
                    Why is it late?
          
                              STUDENT
                    I had some personal things to deal
                    with.
          
                     5
          
          
          
          Walter hands back the paper.
          
                              WALTER
                    I'm sorry. I can't accept it now.
          
                                 STUDENT
                    But...
          
                                 WALTER
                    I'm sorry.
          
          Walter goes back to work. The Student sits stunned for a
          moment and then gets up and picks up his paper. He opens the
          door and then stops.
          
                              STUDENT
                    You know you still haven't given us
                    a syllabus.
          
                              WALTER
                        (Lying)
                    I know.
          
          The Student shakes his head and leaves without another word.
          
          
          EXT. WALTER'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON
          
          Walter pulls into the driveway of his house. He gets out,
          grabs his belongings out of the back seat and walks inside.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DUSK
          
          Walter is making dinner. Classical music plays from the other
          room. He adjusts the flame and covers a sauce pot. He leans
          against the counter and picks up a half empty bottle of wine
          and pours some into his glass. He catches sight of A SMALL
          FRAMED PICTURE of him and HIS WIFE, smiling.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S HOUSE,    LIVING ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter sits at the piano and practices. It is still going
          badly. The wine glass sits on top of the piano. He lifts his
          hand and inspects his "tunnel".
          
          
          INT. CONNECTICUT COLLEGE, WALTER'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Walter is at his computer. He pulls up his YEAR SYLLABUS on
          the computer and carefully changes 2005 to 2006. He saves it.
          His work is done. There is a knock at the door.
          
                     6
          
          
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yes.
          
          The door opens and Walter's colleague, CHARLES VAN HORN steps
          in.
          
                              CHARLES
                    Hello Walter.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Charles.
          
                              CHARLES
                    I'm sorry to interrupt.
          
                                 WALTER
                    That's OK.
          
                              CHARLES
                    Walter, Shelley can't make it down
                    to the NYU conference to present
                    your paper. I'm going to need you
                    to cover for her.
          
                              WALTER
                    Why can't she go?
          
                              CHARLES
                    She's been put on bed rest until
                    she has the baby.
          
          Walter is caught off guard.
          
                                 WALTER
                    When?
          
                              CHARLES
                    Next week. We'll cover your class
                    and make the arrangements.
          
                              WALTER
                    I wish I could, but now is not a
                    very good time, Charles.
          
                              CHARLES
                    I understand but you co-authored
                    the paper and the Dean wants it
                    presented. He wants to keep Shelley
                    on track for tenure.
          
                              WALTER
                    I just don't think I can with the
                    start of classes and my book.
          
                     7
          
          
          
                              CHARLES
                    You're only teaching one class,
                    Walter.
          
                               WALTER
                    So I can stay focused on my
                    writing. I'd really rather not go
                    right now.
          
                              CHARLES
                    I'm sorry but there really isn't
                    another option at this point.
          
          Walter is trapped. He comes clean.
          
                              WALTER
                    Charles, the truth is this is
                    really Shelley's paper. I just
                    agreed to co-author it because she
                    asked me to. I'm not really
                    prepared to present it.
          
                              CHARLES
                    That may be the case but you are
                    the co-author and she can't go.
                    Look Walter, you can take it up
                    with the Dean if you want, but, as
                    your friend, I wouldn't advise it.
                    Not with that argument.
          
          Walter just stares him.
          
                                CHARLES (CONT'D)
                    Good bye.
          
          And Charles is gone, shutting the door behind him.
          
          
          INT. NEW LONDON, THE BLIND TIGER BAR - NIGHT
          
          Walter sits at the end of a bar at a local pub. He is reading
          the newspaper. KAREN, a 44-year-old bartender, is talking to
          a BlONDE HAIRED WOMAN at other end of the bar.
          
          The wall is covered with HAND DRAWN CARICATURES OF REGULAR
          PATRONS. A WAITER hands a plate of food to Karen. She walks
          down the bar and sets it in front of Walter.
          
                              KAREN
                    Here you go, cutey.
          
                                WALTER
                    Thanks.

                              KAREN
                    So I thought you forgot about me.
                    Where've you been hiding?
          
          Karen automatically refills his wine glass.
          
                              WALTER
                    Just busy with work.
          
                              KAREN
                    Well you're never gonna make it on
                    the wall with that excuse. I'm glad
                    your back. Give a holler if you
                    need anything. I'm just gabbing
                    with one of my girlfriends.
          
                              WALTER
                    OK.
          
          She walks back down the bar. Walter starts to eat.
          
          
          EXT. WALTER'S HOUSE - MORNING
          
          Two cars are parked in Walter's driveway.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - SAME
          
          Walter is packing, laying out his shirts on the bed. After a
          moment, Karen walks in, drying her hair with a towel.
          
                              KAREN
                    When are you going?
          
                              WALTER
                    Today after class.
          
          She takes her earrings of the night stand and puts them in.
          
                              KAREN
                    Sounds like fun. I'm gonna go have
                    a cigarette. You want some coffee?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yeah. Thanks.
          
          Karen leaves. Walter keeps packing.
          
          
          EXT. CONNECTICUT COLLEGE, CAFFETERIA - DAY
          
          Walter sits at a table and eats lunch alone.

          EXT. CONNECTICUT COLLEGE, PARKING LOT - LATER
          
          Walter walks across the parking lot and gets into his car.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S CAR - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Walter drives along the highway. He notices a SIGN which
          reads "Support Our Troops!"
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK CITY, F.D.R. DRIVE - SUNSET
          
          Walter's car drives down the F.D.R Highway.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S CAR - DUSK.
          
          Walter drives through the small busy streets of the East
          Village.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK CITY, EAST VILLAGE, PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT
          
          Walter pulls into a parking garage. He gets out and takes a
          ticket from the attendant. He grabs his bag and briefcase
          from the back seat.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK STREET, EAST VILLAGE - NIGHT
          
          He walks down the street, taking in the sights and sounds of
          the city.
          
          
          EXT. LIQUOR STORE - LATER
          
          Walter walks out of a liquor store with a SMALL BROWN BAG.
          
          
          EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME
          
          Walter arrives at a classic tenement building. He looks up at
          the building as if inspecting it.
          
          He takes out his keys. He opens the door and walks in.
          
          
          INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME
          
          Walter walks into the well-lit but dingy foyer.   A YOUNG MAN
          brushes by him.
          
                       10
          
          
          
          
          INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, FOURTH FLOOR - CONTINUOUS
          
          He arrives at the second floor and stops in front of a door.
          He unlocks the door and walks in.
          
          
          INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter steps into the apartment and drops his bags. He
          immediately notices that the kitchen light is on. Something
          is not right.
          
                              WALTER
                    Hello?
          
          He turns on the living room light and crosses to the kitchen
          table and sets the brown bag down. It's then that he notices
          some fresh flowers on the kitchen table. He looks slightly
          confused. He looks around the apartment. There is an UPRIGHT
          PIANO along one wall.
          
                              WALTER (CONT'D)
                    Hello?
          
          There is no answer. He walks down a LONG HALLWAY and looks in
          the kitchen. Nothing. He walks over to the FIRST BEDROOM and
          looks inside. There are signs of someone living there. He
          looks in the SECOND BEDROOM. He sees nothing.
          
          Suddenly he hears the sound of running water from the
          bathroom. He notices a light under the door. He walks to the
          bathroom and listens. A faucet is turned and the water stops
          running. He opens the door and looks in.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - SAME
          
          A YOUNG BLACK WOMAN is soaking in the bath tub.   She see's
          Walter and screams.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - SAME
          
          Walter screams too and then slams the door, stepping back
          into the hallway.
          
                              YOUNG BLACK WOMAN
                    Stay away from me!
          
          She has a West African accent.
          
                    11
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    It's OK. I'm not going...
          
                              AFRICAN WOMAN
                    Leave me alone! My boyfriend is
                    coming home!
          
                              WALTER
                    I'm not going to hurt you.
          
                              AFRICAN WOMAN
                    Who are you? What are you doing in
                    here!?
          
                              WALTER
                    This is my apartment.
          
                              AFRICAN WOMAN
                    What do you mean? This apartment
                    does not belong to you. How did you
                    get in?
          
                              WALTER
                    My name is Walter Vale. I have
                    keys. It's my...
          
          Suddenly Walter is pushed up against the wall. Hard.
          
                              MAN'S VOICE
                    What the fuck?!
          
          A very angry, YOUNG MIDDLE EASTERN MAN is in Walter's face.
          He grabs Walter violently by the collar and shakes him.
          
                              YOUNG MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
                    Who are you?! Zainab?!
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I'm in here! He is crazy!
          
                              WALTER
                    Stop it! I am not...
          
          The Young Middle Eastern Man slams him against the wall. It's
          more of a warning shot then a violent act. Walter is
          terrified.
          
                               YOUNG MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
                    Shut up!
          
                               WALTER
                    OK. OK.
          
                 12
          
          
          
                              ZAINAB (O.S.)
                        (In French)
                    Tarek. What is happening?
          
                              TAREK
                        (In French)
                    Are you OK?
          
                              ZAINAB
                        (In French)
                    I'm fine.
          
                              TAREK
                        (In French)
                    Who is this?
          
                              ZAINAB
                        (In French)
                    I have no idea! I was in the bath
                    and he was just standing there.
          
                              TAREK
                        (Shaking Walter)
                    Did you touch her?! Did you touch
                    her?!
          
                              WALTER
                    No! No!
          
          Zainab opens the door.
          
                              ZAINAB
                        (In French)
                    He didn't touch me! But how did he
                    get in? He said he has keys.
          
                              TAREK
                    Do you have keys?
          
                               WALTER
                    Yes! Yes! I have keys. It's my
                    apartment.
          
          Tarek stares at Walter, trying to make sense of it.
          
                               ZAINAB
                        (in French)
                    What does he mean it's his
                    apartment?
          
                              TAREK
                    I don't know! Show me your keys!
          
                    13
          
          
          
          Walter reaches into his pocket and holds up his keys.
          
                              WALTER
                    This is my apartment. I've owned it
                    for twenty-five years.
          
                              TAREK
                    So why haven't you been here!?
          
                              WALTER
                    I live in Connecticut. I haven't
                    used it in a long time.
          
          Walter is starting to get through.
          
                              TAREK
                    Are you friends with Ivan?
          
                              WALTER
                    Ivan? Who is Ivan?
          
          Tarek is getting nervous.
          
                              ZAINAB
                        (In French)
                    I knew this would happen! He
                    probably called the police.
          
          This catches Tarek's attention.
          
                              TAREK
                        (to Walter)
                    Did you call the police?
          
          Walter hesitates.
          
                              WALTER
                    No.
          
                              TAREK
                    You didn't call the police?
          
                              WALTER
                    No.
          
          Tarek looks like he might belt Walter. Instead, he lets him
          go and quickly backs up. He paces while trying to gather his
          thoughts. Walter doesn't move. Zainab runs into the bedroom.
          
                              TAREK
                    And you don't know Ivan?
          
                    14
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    I don't know Ivan. Who is he?
          
                              TAREK
                    He rented us this place. He said it
                    belonged to his friend who was out
                    of town.
          
                              WALTER
                    I don't know who he is but this is
                    my apartment. I assure you.
          
          Tarek looks at Walter for a long moment. It's clear that he's
          telling the truth.
          
                               TAREK
                    Shit!
          
                              ZAINAB (O.S.)
                        (In French)
                    I told you not to trust anyone. You
                    never saw a contract.
          
                               TAREK
                    Enough! OK. Look. We don't want any
                    trouble. We will get out of your
                    apartment. This is all a mistake.
                    I'm sorry.
          
                               WALTER
                    OK.
          
                              TAREK
                    We will leave, OK?
          
                               WALTER
                    Yes. OK.
          
          Zainab emerges from the bedroom. She is dressed.
          
                              ZAINAB
                        (In French)
                    Where are we going to go?
          
                              TAREK
                        (In French)
                    I don't know but we have to go.
          
                              ZAINAB
                        (In French)
                    I know we have to go. I am not
                    stupid!
          
                      15
          
          
          
                              TAREK
                    Are you OK?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. I'm just going to sit down.
          
                              TAREK
                    Of course. Please.
          
          Walter nods and then slowly walks down the hallway and sits
          down. He is clearly shaken. Tarek shuts the front door.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    I'm sorry if I hurt you. Are you
                    sure that you're OK?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yeah. I'm OK.
          
                              TAREK
                    OK. Well, we'll pack up and get
                    out.
          
          Tarek walks back toward the bedroom. Walter tries to catch
          his breath.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - LATER
          
          Walter is sitting on the couch with a glass of wine. Tarek
          enters and sets down a bag. He picks up TWO AFRICAN DRUMS
          next to the piano and places them by the front door.
          
          Zainab enters from the bedroom mumbling something in an
          African dialect. She drops a bag and crosses back to the
          bedroom.
          
                              TAREK
                    I know I'm in trouble when she
                    starts speaking Wolof.
          
                              WALTER
                    How long have you lived here?
          
                              TAREK
                    Two months. We will pay you if you
                    want.
          
          Walter doesn't respond. Zainab emerges from the bedroom again
          with the last bag.
          
                       16
          
          
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                        (To Zainab)
                    Is that everything?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I think so. Do you want to check!?
          
          He hands her a SMALL PLASTIC BAG from a local grocery.
          
                              TAREK
                    Here is the coffee you wanted.
          
          She snatches it without a word.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                        (To Walter)
                    OK. So we'll go. I am sorry again.
                    Thank you for your understanding.
                    Good bye.
          
                                WALTER
                    Good bye.
          
          They turn and exit. Walter gets up and walks over to the
          front door and locks it.
          
          He stands by the front door trying to process the events.
          Then something catches his attention.
          
          
          WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter walks to the window and picks up a handcrafted,
          decorative FRAME off of the sill. It is a PHOTOGRAPH of Tarek
          and Zainab. They are hugging each other and smiling. Walter
          looks down onto the street.
          
          He sees Zainab and Tarek exit the building and cross the
          street. Zainab's cart tips on the curb and the contents spill
          out onto the sidewalk. Tarek quickly moves to help her.
          Zainab yells at him.
          
          Walter watches as they finally collect their belongings and
          move down the street.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - LATER
          
          Tarek has set his bags down in front of a closed store. He is
          talking in a very agitated tone on his cell phone. Zainab
          stands by silently.
          
                    17
          
          
          
                              TAREK
                        (In Arabic)
                    Look I know. Come on man, it'll
                    just be for a night or two until we
                    figure something out. OK.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Tarek?
          
                              TAREK
                        (In Arabic)
                    Can you check and call me back?
                    OK. Thanks.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Tarek?
          
                              TAREK
                    What!?
          
          Zainab points. Walter is standing there holding the framed
          photograph.
          
                              WALTER
                    You left this at the apartment.
          
          Tarek walks over and takes it.
          
                              TAREK
                    Thanks.
          
          Walter nods.
          
                              WALTER
                    Do you know where you're going to
                    stay tonight?
          
                              TAREK
                    Yeah.
          
          The lie is obvious. They are stuck. Walter just nods again.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter takes some books out of his briefcase. He crosses to
          the bookshelf and sets them down. He notices a small stack of
          CD's sitting on a shelf. He picks one of them up and stares
          at the CD for a long moment.
          
                              TAREK
                    You like classical music, huh?
          
                     18
          
          
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yes.
          
          Walter sets down the CD.
          
                              TAREK
                    Me too. Do you play piano?
          
                                 WALTER
                    No.
                        (Beat)
                    Do you?
          
                              TAREK
                    Me? No. I play the djembe. Well,
                    thanks again for letting us stay.
                    You saved me a lot of trouble.
          
          Walter nods.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    See you in the morning.
          
                              WALTER
                    OK. Good night.
          
          Tarek goes to bed. Walter resumes his work.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Walter is lying in bed, unable to sleep. He can hear Tarek
          and Zainab whispering and laughing.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, TAREK AND ZAINAB'S ROOM - SAME
          
          Tarek and Zainab are lying in bed together.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Stop it, Tarek. He'll hear us.
          
                              TAREK
                    Trust me. He's asleep.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    You don't know that.
          
                              TAREK
                    So let him hear. The guy probably
                    needs some excitement.
          
                    19
          
          
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I think he's probably had enough
                    for one night.
          
          Tarek nuzzles her. Zainab laughs but pushes him away.
          
                                 ZAINAB (CONT'D)
                    Tarek. No!
          
          Zainab sits up in the bed. Tarek relents and rolls onto his
          back.
          
                              ZAINAB (CONT'D)
                    What are we going to do, Tarek?
          
                               TAREK
                    I don't know. We'll figure it out
                    tomorrow. Who knows? Maybe he'll
                    let us stay. He's not really using
                    the place.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I don't want to be his roommate!
          
                              TAREK
                    OK. OK. So we'll figure it out in
                    the morning. I promise, habibti.
          
          Zainab shakes her head.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Do you still love me?
          
          Zainab looks at him.
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    No.
          
                                 TAREK
                    Really?
          
          Zainab rolls over and straddles Tarek.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    No. I don't love you.
          
          She kisses Tarek.
          
                              TAREK
                    Not even a little?
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    No.
          
                    20
          
          
          
          She kisses him again.
          
                              TAREK
                    So what is this?
          
          She gets very close to his face.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    It's your punishment.
          
                              TAREK
                    But what about our roommate?
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    Shhh.
          
          She kisses him long and hard. They start to make love.
          
          
          EXT. WALTER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING
          
          Jacob walks outside with Sprinkles.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - MORNING
          
          Walter is tying his tie in the mirror.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - LATER
          
          Walter walks out of his bedroom and runs into Zainab who is
          leaving her bedroom at the same time. It's obvious that she
          was trying to avoid Walter.
          
                              WALTER
                    Good morning.
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    Morning.
          
                              WALTER
                    I made some coffee.
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    Thank you.
          
                              WALTER
                    Have a good day.
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    Goodbye.
          
                       21
          
          
          
          Walter leaves.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK UNIVERSITY - DAY
          
          The Kimmel Center towers over Washington Square Park.
          
          
          INT. NEW YORK UNIVERSITY - DAY
          
          Walter is listening to the speaker.
          
                              SPEAKER
                    That will be on the last day of
                    conference. I hope you can all
                    attend. And now I'd like to welcome
                    my distinguished colleague and
                    the winner of John Bates Clark
                    Award, Stephen Kriegman.
          
          STEPHEN KRIEGMAN strides to the podium. He is a good deal
          younger then Walter.
          
                              STEPHEN KRIEGMAN
                    Thank you, Shiva. Good morning.
                    It's a pleasure to be here.
          
          
          INT. NYU BANQUET HALL - NIGHT
          
          Walter mingles at a reception. He is listening to another
          COLLEAGUE tell a story.
          
                              COLLEAGUE #1
                    And so I just stood up and walked
                    out!
          
          The group laughs. Stephen Kriegman approaches and talks to
          the COLLEAGUE.
          
                              STEPHEN KRIEGMAN
                    Jamie!
          
                              JAMIE
                    Stephen, how are you?
          
          Walter walks off.
          
          
          INT. NYU BANQUET HALL - LATER
          
          Walter eats dinner in a large, well appointed banquet room.
          Walter listens as a CHATTY MAN talks.
          
                    22
          
          
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER
          
          Walter is walking up the stairs carrying a briefcase. He
          passes a MIDDLE-AGED MAN who is walking down the stairs with
          a SMALL DOG on a leash.
          
                                 MIDDLE-AGED MAN (O.S.)
                    Excuse me.
          
          Walter stops and turns.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              MIDDLE-AGED MAN
                    Are you Mr. Vale?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              MIDDLE-AGED MAN
                    I thought so. How are you? It's me,
                    Jacob Konigsberg. Do you remember
                    me?
          
          Walter doesn't.
          
                              JACOB
                    I used to live here with my mother.
                    Your wife used to give me piano
                    lessons.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Oh. Right.
          
                              JACOB
                    It has been a long time. I thought
                    that maybe you sold the place. Oh.
                    This is Sprinkles.
                        (To the dog)
                    Say "hi", Sprinkles. Is your wife
                    here with you?
          
                              WALTER
                    No. She passed away.
          
                              JACOB
                    What?! No! I had no idea. I'm so
                    sorry. She was such a nice lady.
                    And I just loved listening to her
                    play.

                              WALTER
                    How's your mother?
          
                              JACOB
                    She moved to Florida. Now I live
                    here. It's nice. There are a lot of
                    new faces. I hardly know anyone
                    anymore. But I have Sprinkles so...
          
                              WALTER
                    Nice to see you, Jacob.
          
                              JACOB
                    You too, Mr. Vale. Goodbye. Welcome
                    back.
          
          Walter nods and keeps walking.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Walter walks into the apartment. No one else is there.
          
          He sets down his case and walks toward his bedroom but stops
          at Tarek and Zainab's door, which is closed. He listens.
          Nothing.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Walter is reading over and "rehearsing" the paper that he has
          to present.
          
                              WALTER
                        (Sotto)
                    It is important to distinguish
                    between both our current political
                    assessment and our...It is
                    important to distinguish between
                    our current political assessment...
          
          He stops and crosses out the world "both". He continues
          reading.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter is practicing the piano. He continues to struggle. He
          sits back and takes a break. He notices the drum next to the
          piano. He looks at it for long moment and then continues
          playing.
          
                       24
          
          
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, WALTER'S BEDROOM - LATER
          
          Walter is lying in bed awake. He listens as Tarek and Zainab
          come home.
          
          
          EXT. NEWSSTAND - MORNING
          
          Walter buys a newspaper.
          
          
          INT. NEW YORK UNIVERSITY, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
          
          Walter is back at the conference. He is listening to a
          presentation by a GERMAN ECONOMIST.
          
                              GERMAN ECONOMIST
                    However, we do find that financial
                    globalization can be beneficial
                    under the right circumstances.
                    Empirically, good institutions and
                    quality of governance are crucial
                    in helping developing countries
                    derive the benefits of
                    globalization.
          
          Walter checks his watch. He is obviously bored.
          
          
          EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - LATER
          
          Walter is sitting in the park and eating some Indian food
          from a local cart vendor. He finishes and drops it into the
          garbage can. He checks his watch and starts to head back
          toward the conference when a SOUND catches his attention.
          
          
          EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - LATER
          
          Walter watches two young AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN drumming on
          BUCKETS with reckless abandon.
          
                              MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    We should have them come play
                    inside.
          
          Walter turns. THREE COLLEAGUES from the conference are
          standing next to him.
          
                                 COLLEAGUE #1
                    Coming in?
          
                    25
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. In a minute.
                        (Holding up his cell
                         phone)
                    I have to make a call.
          
                              COLLEAGUE #1
                    See you inside.
          
          Walter nods as the guys walk off. Walter watches them go. He
          turns and watches the drumming again.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter arrives on the top floor. He can hear the drum being
          played. He stops in front of his apartment. He listens for a
          moment and then slowly opens the door.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Tarek is playing his drum in his T-shirt and underwear. He
          sees Walter and finishes with a flourish.
          
                              TAREK
                    Hey Walter. Welcome home.
          
                              WALTER
                    Hi.
          
          Tarek casually gets up and puts on his pants.
          
                              TAREK
                    You're home early.
          
                              WALTER
                    It was a half day.
          
                              TAREK
                    How was the conference?
          
                              WALTER
                    Fine.
          
          Tarek buttons his pants.
          
                              TAREK
                    Sorry about the pants. I've been
                    playing like this since I was a
                    kid.
          
          Walter nods.
          
                      26
          
          
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Hey. I think I might have a lead on
                    a place in Brooklyn.
          
                              WALTER
                    That's good.
                    You can keep practicing if you
                    like.
          
                              TAREK
                    Really? It won't bother you?
          
                               WALTER
                    No.   It's fine.
          
                              TAREK
                    Great. Thanks. I'll keep my pants
                    on.
          
          Tarek laughs. Walter smiles.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Hey, Zainab's going to make dinner
                    if you want to eat with us later.
          
                              WALTER
                    OK. Thank you.
          
          Walter walks into his bedroom. Tarek watches him go and then
          starts playing again.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - LATER
          
          Walter is lying down on his bed reading through his paper.
          His foot is tapping to the rhythm of the drum.
          
          
          INT. APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Walter and Zainab are sitting at the dinner table finishing
          their meal. Tarek is on the phone in the living room speaking
          in Arabic. He hangs up and rejoins the table.
          
                              TAREK
                    I'm sorry. That was my mother. If I
                    don't call her every day she thinks
                    something happened to me.
          
          
          Walter pours himself some wine. He offers some to Tarek.
          
                     27
          
          
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Yeah. I'll have a bit. Thanks.
          
          Zainab shoots Tarek a glance. Walter misreads it.
          
                              WALTER
                    Are you sure that you wouldn't like
                    some?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I don't drink.
          
                               TAREK
                         (Jokingly)
                    She is a good Muslim. I'm a bad
                    one.
          
          Walter nods. Zainab gets up and starts to clear the table.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Are you finished?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. Thank you. Here, let me...
          
                              ZAINAB
                    It's the least I can do.
          
          Her comment is more of an indictment than a pleasantry.
          
                              WALTER
                    Well, thank you for the dinner. It
                    was very good.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    You're welcome.
          
          She leaves the room.
          
                              TAREK
                    So what's the conference about?
          
                              WALTER
                    Economic Growth in Developing
                    Nations.
          
                               TAREK
                    That's us.
                        (Pointing)
                    Syria. Senegal.
          
                     28
          
          
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    So have you written some books?
          
                              WALTER
                    Three. I'm working on my fourth.
          
                              TAREK
                    Four books?! Great. My father was
                    a writer. A journalist.
          
                              WALTER
                    Is he still writing?
          
                              TAREK
                    No. He died. Before we left Syria.
          
                                 WALTER
                    I'm sorry.
          
                                 TAREK
                    So am I.
          
          Zainab enters.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Tarek. It's eight-thirty.
          
                              TAREK
                    Oh. We have to go.
                        (To Walter)
                    I have a gig tonight.
          
          
          Zainab starts to put on her coat.   Tarek picks up his drum.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Walter, you can come if you want.
          
          Zainab shoots Tarek a glance.
          
                               WALTER
                    I have to get some work done but
                    thank you.
          
                              TAREK
                    OK. Well maybe another time
          
                                 WALTER
                    OK.
          
                                 TAREK
                    Bye.
          
                      29
          
          
          
          Tarek and Zainab leave. Walter watches them go and then looks
          around the empty apartment.
          
          
          INT.    WALTER'S APARTMENT BUILDING, STAIRS - CONTINUOUS
          
          Tarek and Zainab are walking down the stairs.
          
                                 ZAINAB
                           (In French)
                       Why did you invite him?
          
                                 TAREK
                           (In French)
                       We're staying in his apartment.
                       What could I do?
          
                                 ZAINAB
                           (In French)
                       Well I would have been the one
                       stuck sitting with him while you
                       played your drum.
          
          Tarek turns and looks at her very seriously.
          
                                 TAREK
                       You know you are very sexy when
                       you're mad at me.
          
          Zainab can't help but smile. Tarek starts to wrap his arms
          around her.
          
                                 WALTER (O.S.)
                       Hello.
          
          Tarek and Zainab stop in their tracks, already three flights
          down. They both look up the stairwell. Walter is looking down
          on them.
          
                                 WALTER (CONT'D)
                       If you don't mind, I think I will
                       come.
          
          Tarek and Zainab share a quick look.
          
                                 TAREK
                       Cool.
          
          Walter disappears back into the apartment. Zainab looks at
          Tarek. He shrugs.
          
                    30
          
          
          
          
          INT. SMALL RESTAURANT - LATER.
          
          Tarek's Jazz Trio is playing. Walter and Zainab sit at a
          small table in the back. Walter is rapt. Zainab is sketching.
          She looks up from her pad and watches him before returning to
          her drawing.
          
          
          EXT. SMALL RESTAURANT - LATER
          
          Walter and Zainab are standing outside on the empty street.
          There's an awkward silence.
          
                              WALTER
                    He's very good.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Yes.
          
                              WALTER
                    The whole band is very good.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Yes.
          
          And then nothing. Finally Tarek emerges.
          
                              TAREK
                    Sorry guys. Let's go.
          
          They walk down the street.
          
          
          EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - DAY
          
          Walter is sitting in the park and eating PIZZA. This time he
          is sitting directly across from the two African American
          drummers.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter walks into the apartment and sets down his briefcase.
          He notices Tarek's drum sitting in the middle of the room.
          
                              WALTER
                    Tarek?
          
          No one answers. Walter walks down the hallway a bit.
          
                              WALTER (CONT'D)
                    Tarek?
          
                       31
          
          
          
          Walter walks back into the living room and takes off his
          coat. He removes some papers from his briefcase and then he
          notices the drum again.
          
          He sits down in the chair next to Tarek's drum. He takes the
          drum between his legs and he hits it a few times.
          
          Then he starts to play. He stops and then he plays again.
          This time he is slightly more successful at finding a rhythm.
          He closes his eyes and bobs his head. He's really getting
          into it.
          
          He opens his eye's open and Tarek is standing in front of
          him. He has headphones around his neck. Walter jumps.
          
                              WALTER (CONT'D)
                    Oh. Hi.
          
                              TAREK
                    It sounded good Walter.
          
          Walter immediately stands.
          
                              WALTER
                    Yeah. Well. I was just...I'm sorry
                    if I...
          
          Tarek walks over and grabs another chair from the kitchen
          table.
          
                               TAREK
                    Don't be sorry. That's what it's
                    there for.
          
          Tarek sets the chair down and grabs the other drum from
          beside the piano.
          
                               TAREK (CONT'D)
                    I was lying on my bed listening to
                    my music and then I was like
                    "what's the crazy rhythm I'm
                    hearing?".
          
          Tarek sits down with the other drum facing Walter.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Sit. Come on. I'll show you.
          
          Walter hesitates and then sits down.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Just put your feet flat on the
                    ground.
          
                   32
          
          
          
          Walter adjusts his feet.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Now take the drum between your
                    legs. Like this.
          
          Tarek grabs the drums with his knees. Walter follows.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Now you want to lift the inside
                    edge off the ground with your
                    ankles. Like this.
          
          Walter watches Tarek and follows suit.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Great. Feel OK?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              TAREK
                    OK. Now Walter, I know you're a
                    very smart man but with the drum
                    you have to remember not to think.
                    Thinking just screws it up. OK?
          
                                 WALTER
                    OK.
          
                              TAREK
                    Now just give it a couple of bangs.
          
          Walter gives it a couple of hard bangs.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Not so hard. You're not angry at
                    it.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Oh. Right.     Sorry.
          
          He bangs it a few more times.
          
                              TAREK
                    Better. Did you think?
          
                                 WALTER
                    No.
          
                    33
          
          
          
                              TAREK
                    Good. Now one more thing, Walter.
                    You listen to classical music so
                    you think in fours. One. Two.
                    Three. Four. Da. Da. Da. Da. This
                    is an African drum. So we are gonna
                    play in three's. Tat. Tat. Tat. You
                    have to forget your classical.
                    Leave it behind. Tat. Tat. Tat.
                    One. Two. Three. Come on. Follow
                    me.
          
          Tarek bangs out a simple bass beat. Walter joins in.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Good. Good ear. Now keep going.
          
          Walter loses the beat.   Tarek keeps playing.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Don't worry. Start again.
          
          Walter tries again. And again. And then finally he gets it.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Yeah! There it is. OK. Good. Now
                    keep it going and I will do this.
          
          Tarek riffs off of Walter's bass beat.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Yeah. That's it. Keep it going.
          
          
          EXT. STREET FAIR - DAY
          
          Zainab is closing up her booth. Another VENDOR walks by and
          says good bye. Zainab smiles and nods good bye.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK - STREET
          
          Zainab is walking home with her supplies. Two NEW YORK POLICE
          OFFICERS are talking to THREE YOUNG HISPANIC KIDS. Zainab
          hesitates for the slightest moment before lowering her head
          and walking past.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Zainab enters the apartment and sees Walter drumming. His
          shirt is unbuttoned exposing his white undershirt. He stops.
          He is breathing very hard and sweating.
          
                     34
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    Hello.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Hello. Where is Tarek?
          
          She places her items down on the kitchen table and takes off
          her coat. She looks around the apartment.
          
                               WALTER
                    He went out. To look at another
                    apartment.
          
          She just looks at him with the drum. Walter is still out of
          breath.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Are you OK?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yeah. Tarek is teaching me the
                    drum. I'm practicing. Don't worry,
                    I'll keep my pants on.
          
          Zainab looks shocked. Walter's attempt at levity has fallen
          short.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    What?
          
                              WALTER
                    Nothing. I was just...nothing.
          
          Zainab nods and walks into the kitchen.
          
          
          INT. JAZZ CLUB - LATER
          
          Tarek is playing with his band. Walter is at the bar
          watching. He is unconsciously tapping along on the bar.
          
          
          INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - SAME
          
          Tarek, Walter, and Darren - the saxophone player - sit at a
          table by the window, eating.
          
                              TAREK
                    Hey Walter, what time are you done
                    tomorrow?
          
                 35
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    I have to present a paper at
                    eleven. I should be done by twelve-
                    thirty.
          
                               TAREK
                    Cool.
          
                              DARREN
                        (To the waiter)
                    Hey man, could we get another order
                    of this?
                        (To Walter and Tarek)
                    I love this food.
          
                              TAREK
                    That's good. Because the Chinese
                    are taking over the world.
          
                              DARREN
                    That's not gonna happen.
          
                              TAREK
                    It's already happening. One day our
                    kids will be going to China for
                    jobs. Ask Walter.
          
          Darren and Tarek look at Walter.
          
                              DARREN
                    You think that's true?
          
          Walter is put on the spot.
          
                              WALTER
                    Well...if China continues to
                    threaten the wage earners in the
                    first-world economies by keeping
                    wages down, then it's really just a
                    matter of time. What they buy they
                    inflate. What they sell they
                    deflate. But then you have to ask
                    the question `who's paying the
                    cost?'. And the answer is the
                    Chinese people.
          
          Beat.
          
                               TAREK
                    You see?
          
          Tarek continues eating.
          
                     36
          
          
          
          
          INT. NEW YORK UNIVERSITY, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
          
          Walter is presenting his paper.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK STREET - LATER
          
          Walter is walks out of the building talking to a FEMALE
          COLLEAGUE.
          
                              TAREK (O.S.)
                    Hey, Walter!
          
          Walter and the Female Colleague turn. Tarek is standing a few
          feet away holding both drums.
          
          Walter nods and says good bye to the Colleague who looks a
          bit confused. Walter walks over to Tarek.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    How did the presentation go?
          
                              WALTER
                    Fine. Thanks.
          
                              TAREK
                    Cool. Guess what? I found an
                    apartment in Brooklyn. We can move
                    in on Monday.
          
                              WALTER
                    That's good.
          
                              TAREK
                    Yeah. It's small but it's a nice
                    building. I just hope Zainab likes
                    it.
          
                              WALTER
                    I think she will as long as no else
                    lives there.
          
          Tarek laughs.
          
                              TAREK
                    I think you're right. Come on,
                    let's go. You should take off the
                    name tag.
          
                              WALTER
                    Oh. Yeah. Thanks.
          
                    37
          
          
          
          Walter takes off his name tag and they start to walk.
          
                              WALTER (CONT'D)
                    Are you hungry?
          
                              TAREK
                    Yeah. I'm starving. Do you like
                    shwarmas?
          
                              WALTER
                    Uh...yeah. I like sharmas.
          
                                 TAREK
                    Shwarmas.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yeah.
          
          They walk across the park.
          
          
          INT. FALAFEL STAND - LATER
          
          Walter and Tarek are finishing lunch. Tarek reaches into his
          bag and takes out a SMALL BAG.
          
                              TAREK
                    Here. This is for you. For letting
                    us stay.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Thank you.
          
          Walter takes it and opens it. It's a CD.
          
                              TAREK
                    It's Fela Kuti. You know him?
          
                                 WALTER
                    No.
          
                              TAREK
                    You don't know Fela? Oh, man!
                    Walter, you are in for a treat. He
                    started the whole Afro-Beat
                    movement. And his drummer Tony
                    Allen was just scary, man. You want
                    to play drums, you have to listen
                    to this.
          
                              WALTER
                    OK. I will.
          
                     38
          
          
          
          A HANDSOME ARAB MAN walks past with a PRETTY BLONDE WOMAN.
          Tarek sees him and waves.
          
                                 OMAR
                           (In Arabic)
                       Hey Tarek. How's it going?
          
                                 TAREK
                           (in Arabic)
                       Good, Omar. How are you?
          
                                 OMAR
                           (In Arabic)
                       Not bad. It's fall in New York, you
                       know? How's the band?
          
                                 TAREK
                           (In Arabic)
                       Good. Playing a lot. New
                       girlfriend?
          
                                 OMAR
                           (In Arabic)
                       New friend.
          
                                 TAREK
                           (In Arabic)
                       You have a lot friends
          
                                 OMAR
                           (In Arabic)
                       I'm a very nice guy. Au revoir.
          
                                    TAREK
                       Au revoir.
          
          Omar walks off. Tarek shakes his head.
          
                                  TAREK (CONT'D)
                       The Lebanese. Bunch of playboys.
                       You ready?
          
                                    WALTER
                       Yeah.
          
          They pick up their drums and leave.
          
          
          EXT.    NEW YORK STREET FAIR - LATER
          
          Zainab is talking to two UPPER EAST SIDE WOMEN who have
          stopped at her stall.
          
                    39
          
          
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Yes. I made it.
          
                                 UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN
                    How much?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Thirty-five dollars.
          
                              UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN
                    Will you take thirty?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    No. thiry-five.
          
                              UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN
                    OK. I know my daughter will think
                    it's "cool". Here.
          
          She hands her the money. Zainab takes it and drops it into a
          small pouch.
          
                              UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN (CONT'D)
                    Where are you from?
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    Senegal.
          
                              UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN
                    Oh. I was in Cape Town two winters
                    ago. It was just beautiful.
          
                              ZAINAB
                        (Handing her the bag)
                    Thank you very much.
          
                                 UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN
                    Thank you.
          
          The Woman walks away. A young Israeli man, ZEV is sitting at
          a nearby stall selling T-shirts.
          
                              ZEV
                    How far is Senegal from Cape Town?
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    Far.
          
                              ZEV
                    I told a guy I was from Israel
                    yesterday and he asked if I had
                    ever visited the Holy Land.
          
                     40
          
          
          
          Zainab smiles. Zev sees someone over Zainab's shoulder.
          
                              ZEV (CONT'D)
                    Hey, look who it is. What's up
                    Tarek?
          
          Tarek and Walter are approaching.
          
                               TAREK
                    Zev!   How are you?
          
                                 ZEV
                    Good man.
          
                                 TAREK
                    Hey honey.
          
          He kisses Zainab.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Hello. Hi, Walter.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Hi.
          
                              TAREK
                    How's business?
          
                              ZEV
                    Ahh. You know.
          
          Walter looks at the Zainab's jewelry.
          
                              TAREK
                    Her stuff is great, right? She made
                    me this?
          
          Tarek holds up his wrist, revealing a bracelet.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    You should make one for Walter.
          
          Zainab nods noncommittally.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    So Walter and I are going up to the
                    park to play for a little bit. OK?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Tarek, I told you we have to pick
                    up my new table today. He said he
                    would only hold it for today.
          
                    41
          
          
          
                              TAREK
                    I know. I know. No problem.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Tarek. You always say "no problem"
                    and then you are late or you
                    forget.
          
          Tarek smiles.
          
                              TAREK
                    I know. I will not be long. We'll
                    go up and play and then we'll come
                    back to help you. I promise,
                    habibti.
          
          He kisses her and starts to walk away.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Yes. It's always "habibti" when you
                    want your way. It closes at five
                    p.m. Not Arab time, Tarek.
          
                              TAREK
                    No. Not Arab time. Real time,
                    habibti.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Don't "habibti" me.
          
          They turn and start to leave.
          
                              WALTER
                    What does habibti mean?
          
                              TAREK
                    Habibti? It means "beloved one".
          
                              WALTER
                    Does she know that?
          
          Tarek laughs.
          
          
          INT. SUBWAY - LATER
          
          Tarek and Walter are waiting for the subway. A CHINESE
          MUSICIAN is playing on the opposite platform.
          
                              TAREK
                    He's been playing here for a long
                    time.
          
                      42
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    Is he good?
          
                              TAREK
                    I have no idea but it's cool.
                    I always wanted to play down here.
                    It's supposed to be good money.
          
                              WALTER
                    So why haven't you?
          
          Tarek shrugs.
          
                              TAREK
                    Maybe some day we can do it
                    together. Split the profits.
          
          Walter watches the Chinese Musician.
          
          
          EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LATER.
          
          Walter and Tarek stand in front of the DRUM CIRCLE    in
          Central Park.
          
                              TAREK
                    What do you think?
          
          Walter sizes it up and makes his assessment.
          
                              WALTER
                    I think I'll just watch.
          
                              TAREK
                    Come on, Walter.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    It's easy. You just wait until you
                    feel it. Let's go.
          
          Tarek joins the drum circle. Walter lingers.
          
          
          EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LATER.
          
          Walter is on the edge of the Drum Circle, waiting to "feel
          it". Tarek is next to him playing away.
          
          Tarek looks at Walter and nods. Finally Walter starts to
          play. Slowly at first, but then he starts to really commit.
          Tarek encourages him with a smile.
          
                       43
          
          
          
          
          EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LATER
          
          Tarek and Walter are leaving the park. Tarek checks his
          watch.
          
                                 TAREK
                       Shit, we have to get home. Zainab
                       is gonna kill me. I'm on Arab time
                       again.
          
                                 WALTER
                       What is Arab time?
          
                                 TAREK
                       It means I'm late by an hour. All
                       Arabs are late by an hour. It's
                       genetic. We can't help it.
          
          
          EXT.    72ND STREET SUBWAY STATION - LATER
          
          Tarek and Walter hurry down the stairs of the subway station.
          
          
          INT. 72ND STREET SUBWAY STATION - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter and Tarek approach the turnstile.     They can hear the
          train arriving.
          
                                 TAREK
                       That's our train!
          
          They pick up the pace. Walter puts down his drum to take out
          his METROCARD. Tarek quickly picks it up.
          
                                 TAREK (CONT'D)
                       I got your drum. My card is empty.
                       Can you swipe me?
          
          Walter swipes his card for Tarek to pass through and then he
          swipes his own turnstile.
          
          Walter passes through. Tarek struggles a bit with both
          drums. He gets halfway through when the turnstile bar locks.
          He's stuck.
          
                                 TAREK (CONT'D)
                           (Laughing)
                       Hey. You paid for the drum and not
                       me. Here take this.
          
                    44
          
          
          
          Walter takes Tarek's drum and Tarek quickly ducks under the
          turn style that Walter just paid for.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                        (Re: the train)
                    I think we missed it. Zainab is not
                    going to be happy if...
          
          Suddenly a MAN takes Tarek by the arm.
          
                              MAN
                    Excuse me, sir. Could you please
                    step over here.
          
          Tarek reacts by pulling his arm away.
          
                              TAREK
                    What are you doing?
          
                              MAN
                    NYPD. Could you please step over
                    here?
          
          He reaches for Tarek again who instinctively moves his arm
          again which agitates the Cop. Another COP enters into the
          action.
          
                              COP #2
                    Just step over here, pal.
          
                              TAREK
                    Please, what do you want...
          
                              COP #1
                    You jumped the turnstile.
          
                              TAREK
                    I did not jump it! I paid. I paid!
                    It just didn't work.
          
          Walter steps up.
          
                              WALTER
                    Sir, I did pay his fare.
          
                              COP #2
                    Could you step back please?
          
                              WALTER
                    But I paid this man's...
          
                              COP #2
                    Sir, stand over there.
          
                    45
          
          
          
                              COP #1
                        (To Tarek)
                    Can I see some ID.
          
          Tarek takes out his wallet. He shows them an ID CARD. Walter
          steps back to the wall and sets the two drums down. Cop #2
          stands between him and the action. Walter can barely make out
          what is being said.
          
                              COP #1 (CONT'D)
                    You got anything else, Tarek.
          
                              TAREK
                    No.
          
                              COP #1
                    Where are you from?
          
                              TAREK
                    Syria. Why?
          
          Tarek is starting to panic. The two Cops share a look.
          Another train passes. Cop #1 asks Tarek a few more questions
          which Walter cannot hear.
          
          Suddenly Cop #1 starts to handcuff Tarek.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Why? I'm sorry. What did I do?
          
          Walter steps forward to intervene.
          
                              WALTER
                    I don't think that's necessary.
          
                              COP #2
                    Well we do. You can come down to
                    the station and make a statement.
          
                              WALTER
                    But he didn't mean...
          
                              COP #2
                    Sir, that's all I'm saying. Now
                    step back or we are gonna take you
                    in too.
          
                              WALTER
                    Where are you taking him?
          
                              COP #2
                    Ninth Precinct.
          
                      46
          
          
          
                              TAREK
                    Walter take the drum. Tell Zainab
                    what happened but don't let her
                    come for me. I will call you.
          
          The two Cops lead Tarek away. Walter watches helplessly.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Don't let her come! I will call
                    her!
          
          Walter watches him go.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Walter enters and shuts the door and Zainab is sitting on the
          couch working on her jewelry.
          
          She stops when she sees Walter standing alone, holding the
          two drums.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Where is Tarek?
          
                              WALTER
                    He was arrested.
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    What?!
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. In the subway.
          
          Zainab immediately starts to panic.
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    Arrested?!
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. It was just a
                    misunderstanding. They said he
                    would be released later tonight.
          
          
          
          
          Zainab really starts to lose it. Her reaction is more than
          Walter was prepared for.
          
                    47
          
          
          
                              ZAINAB
                    How could this happen? He knows
                    better! He would not do anything
                    wrong.
          
                              WALTER
                    He didn't. I'm sure we it will be
                    OK.
          
          She begins to pack up her work.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    No. It won't be OK.
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes it will. I went down to the
                    precinct and made a statement.
          
                              ZAINAB
                        (Snapping at Walter)
                    That doesn't matter! He is
                    illegal! As am I! We are not
                    citizens. Do you know what that
                    means? Do you?! Of course you
                    don't. How could you?
          
          She picks up her things and walks down the hall to her room.
          Walter sits, stunned.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter is talking on his cell phone and pacing.
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. His name is Tarek Khalil.
                    Khalil. K. H. A. L. I. L. That's
                    right. Yes. I came down and made a
                    statement. They said he would be
                    released. That was six hours ago.
                    Well when should we know? Tomorrow?
                    Why? But he...OK. OK. Thank you.
          
          Walter hangs up.
          
          
          EXT. POLICE STATION - MORNING
          
          Walter walks out of the police station. He crosses the
          street. Zainab is standing there.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Well?
          
                     48
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    They've moved him.
          
                                ZAINAB
                    To where?
          
                              WALTER
                    To a detention center in Queens. He
                    was turned over to immigration.
                    They said we can see him during
                    visiting hours tomorrow night from
                    five to ten.
          
          Zainab shakes her head.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I can't visit him or I will end up
                    in that place too.
          
          Zainab fights to restrain her emotions. She turns and walks
          away. Walter watches her go.
          
          
          EXT. WALTER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          Zainab's bedroom light is on.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, TAREK'S & ZAINAB'S ROOM - SAME
          
          Zainab is sitting on her bed and talking on her phone.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Yes. We are going tomorrow. The
                    appointment is at eleven. I don't
                    know, he found him. What? No. I
                    don't want to. I just don't, Tarek.
                    Yes. I've already called him. I
                    know. I know. I just want you to be
                    here with me, Tarek.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK, DOWNTOWN - DAY
          
          A sea of skyscrapers near One Center Street.
          
          
          INT. DOWNTOWN OFFICE BUILDING, ELEVATOR BANK - DAY
          
          Zainab and Walter exit an elevator and walk down the hall.
          
                    49
          
          
          
          
          INT. LAW OFFICE - LATER
          
          Walter and Zainab talk to an, MR. SHAH, an INDIAN IMMIGRATION
          LAWYER who is jotting down notes. He is clinical, almost cold
          in his approach.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Zainab, you're also undocumented,
                    right?
          
                                ZAINAB
                    Yes.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    You know you can't visit Tarek at
                    the detention center, right?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Yes. I know.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    How long have you known Tarek?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Almost a year.
          
                                MR. SHAH
                    Mr. Vale?
          
                                WALTER
                    A week.
          
                                MR. SHAH
                    A week?
          
          Walter nods.
          
                              MR. SHAH (CONT'D)
                    Does Tarek have any family living
                    here?
          
          Walter looks to Zainab.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    His mother lives in Michigan.
          
          This is news to Walter.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    She's also undocumented, correct?
          
          Zainab hesitates.
          
                 50
          
          
          
                              MR. SHAH (CONT'D)
                    It's OK. This is all confidential.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Yes, she is.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Does she know that Tarek is in
                    custody?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    No. Tarek told me not to tell her.
                    He doesn't want to worry her.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Has he ever been convicted of a
                    crime?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    No. He has had no trouble. He is a
                    good person.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Do you know if they ever applied
                    for asylum?
          
          Walter looks at Zainab. She is very uncomfortable.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Yes. When he first arrived from
                    Syria. But he didn't get it.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    When was that?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Seven years ago.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    And did they appeal it?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I don't know.
          
          Mr. Shah jots something down.
          
                              WALTER
                    Why wouldn't they appeal it?
          
                    51
          
          
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Fear of being deported. It used to
                    be that when your asylum case was
                    denied, they let you go until your
                    appeal. A lot of people didn't
                    bother with it. Getting denied once
                    was enough to spook them.
          
                              WALTER
                    So what happens if that's the case?
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Then there may be a final order of
                    deportation on him which means he
                    won't even go before a judge this
                    time. He'll just be deported.
          
                               ZAINAB
                    They had to leave Syria! They had
                    no choice!
          
          This is also news to Walter.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Look, one step at a time. Let me
                    talk to him then we'll have a
                    better idea of his status and what
                    our options are.
          
                              WALTER
                    Is there anything I can do?
          
                                 MR. SHAH
                    Visit him.
          
          The lawyer slides a card across the table. Walter takes it.
          
          
          INT. SUBWAY CAR - DAY
          
          Walter rides the subway. He looks down at the lawyer's card.
          
          
          EXT. QUEENS - LATER
          
          Walter emerges from the subway into a very industrial
          neighborhood. Factories and fences. He checks his piece of
          paper and starts walking.
          
                    52
          
          
          
          
          EXT. QUEENS - LATER
          
          Walter is still walking. The area is very deserted. He stops
          and tries to locate a street address amongst the anonymous
          factories. He checks his sheet of paper and continues
          walking.
          
          
          EXT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER - LATER
          
          Walter is standing in front of the DETENTION CENTER. It looks
          like most of the other factories around it but perhaps with a
          bit more barbed wire.
          
          He presses a button and the automated door slowly opens. He
          walks inside.
          
          
          INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER
          
          Walter walks into a small brightly lit waiting room. A few
          SODA MACHINES and TWELVE BLUE PLASTIC CHAIRS. In one corner
          is a guard booth with THREE GUARDS. One FEMALE GUARD is
          wearing a Muslim headdress. Walter approaches the window and
          waits in line. The other people waiting comprise a mix of
          nationalities: African, Latin American, Chinese, Indian.
          
          The Guard talks to a MAN in front of Walter. The Man has a
          Slavic accent.
          
                              GUARD
                    That detainee has been moved.
          
                                SLAVIC MAN
                    To where?
          
                              GUARD
                    I don't know.
          
                              SLAVIC MAN
                    He was here yesterday.
          
                              GUARD
                    But now he's not. That's all I
                    know. You can call ICE. The number
                    is on the wall. Next. Sir, step
                    aside please.
          
          The Slavic Man reluctantly steps aside, staring at a piece of
          paper. Walter steps up to the window. He sets a piece of
          paper on the window sill.
          
                      53
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    Hi. I'm here to see Tarek Khalil.
          
          The Guard takes it.
          
                              GUARD
                    You been here before?
          
                                WALTER
                    No.
          
                              GUARD
                    Can I see your license please?
          
          Walter takes out his wallet.
          
          
          INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER - LATER
          
          Walter is let through a large metal door. There is an X-RAY
          MACHINE immediately in front of him.
          
          Walter empties his pockets and steps through.
          
          Walter waits for the sliding metal door to open. It does and
          he steps into a small room. The door slides shut and he is
          alone in the small white room until a door on the other side
          slides open.
          
          He steps through and walks down a small hallway. On the left
          side of the hallway are small, glassed in, meeting rooms for
          lawyer consultations.
          
          Walter enters into a large bright room. It resembles a prison
          visitation room. Along the perimeter of the room is a clear
          fiberglass wall with twenty-five small cubicles. Each cubicle
          has one seat and a phone. On the other side of the fiberglass
          is another seat and a phone.
          
          Walter looks around the room at the VISITORS and DETAINEES.
          
          
          INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER, VISITING ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter is still waiting. After a moment a door opens and
          Tarek walks out wearing a blue jump suit. He sees Walter and
          smiles.
          
          They each move toward the other and settle into a vacant
          seat. They both pick up the phone as they sit down.
          
                              TAREK
                    Walter. Thank you for coming.
          
                    54
          
          
          
                                 WALTER
                    Of course.
          
                              TAREK
                    How is Zainab?
          
                              WALTER
                    She's upset. I have a letter from
                    her.
          
                              TAREK
                    You can't give it to me. It has to
                    be sent to me by mail. But you can
                    put it up to the glass.
          
          Walter hesitates.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Go ahead. Open it and place it up
                    to the glass so I can read it. It's
                    OK. It's allowed.
          
          Walter complies. He sets down the phone so that he can press
          the letter up against the glass. Tarek reads the letter.
          
          Walter looks around the room, trying to give Tarek some
          privacy. He watches the various immigrant families speaking
          to one another. Tarek taps the glass and points to Walter's
          phone. Walter picks it up.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Thank you, Walter.
          
          Walter nods as he folds up the envelope and places it back
          into his coat.
          
                              WALTER
                    How are they treating you?
          
                               TAREK
                    OK. The place is very depressing.
                    There is no privacy. The lights are
                    always on.
          
                              WALTER
                    Do you need anything?
          
                              TAREK
                    No. I just want to get out of here.
          
                              WALTER
                    Zainab and I met with a lawyer
                    today.
          
                    55
          
          
          
                              TAREK
                    Yes. What did he say?
          
                              WALTER
                    He is going to stop by to see you
                    tomorrow.
          
          They both sit for a moment. Unsure what to say next. Finally
          Walter's curiosity gets the best of him.
          
                              WALTER (CONT'D)
                    Tarek, Zainab said you were denied
                    asylum.
          
                              TAREK
                    You mean when we came here? Yeah.
          
                              WALTER
                    Did you go to your deportation
                    hearing?
          
                               TAREK
                    Yeah.
          
                               WALTER
                    You did?
          
                              TAREK
                    Yeah. We did everything they told
                    us to.
          
          Walter can only nod, unsure of what else to say.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Hey, could you tell Darren? I
                    didn't call him.
          
          A GUARD walks past and taps Tarek on the shoulder and speaks
          to him. We can't hear what is being said.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                        (To Walter)
                    I have to go. They have to do a bed
                    count. Usually, I can visit for one
                    hour. Can you come tomorrow?
          
                               WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              TAREK
                    Good. And tell Zainab I will call
                    her as soon as I can.
          
                    56
          
          
          
          Walter nods. Tarek gets up.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Goodbye, my friend.
          
                               WALTER
                    Goodbye.
          
          Tarek walks away. Walter watches him go.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/ KITCHEN
          
          Walter and Zainab are sitting at the kitchen table. Zainab is
          holding her letter.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Did you ask him if he went to his
                    hearing?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. He said that he did.
          
          Zainab stands up.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Walter, I'm going to leave now. I
                    have a cousin in the Bronx. I will
                    stay with him for now.
          
                               WALTER
                    You don't have to leave. You can
                    stay here.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I think it's best if I leave. When
                    Tarek calls me then I will tell
                    him. You know how to reach me if
                    you need to. Is it OK if I leave
                    Tarek's things here for now? My
                    cousin's place is not very big.
          
                               WALTER
                    Yes.
          
          
          EXT. WALTER'S BUILDING - LATER
          
          Zainab walks away from the apartment.
          
                       57
          
          
          
          
          INT. SMALL BAR - NIGHT
          
          Walter drinks at the bar and watches Tarek's band play
          without Tarek.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - MORNING
          
          Walter practices the drum.
          
          
          EXT. WALTER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
          
          Jacob walks Sprinkles in front of the apartment building.
          Walter walks outside and waves hello as he walks past.
          
          
          INT. QUEEN'S DETENTION CENTER, VISITORS ROOM - LATER
          
          Darren and Tarek are talking. Walter sits and listens.
          
          
          INT. CAFE - NIGHT
          
          Walter eats alone.
          
          
          EXT. STREET CORNER - MORNING
          
          Walter buys the morning paper from a kiosk. He walks to the
          corner and waits to cross the street. A large group of
          CHINESE TOURISTS led by a TOUR GUIDE step up next to him. He
          is surrounded by them.
          
          
          INT. QUEEN'S DETENTION CENTER, VISITOR'S ROOM - SAME
          
          Tarek talks to Mr. Shah.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - DAY
          
          Walter is playing the drum. He finishes with an "end beat".
          He looks around the quiet apartment.
          
          
          INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER, VISITING ROOM - DAY
          
          Walter is waiting for Tarek. The visiting room is empty.
          Suddenly the door opens on the detainee side of the glass and
          a VERY YOUNG LATIN WOMAN walks out tentatively. She almost
          looks absurd in the oversized blue jumpsuit.
          
                    58
          
          
          
          She looks at Walter, unsure if she is supposed to approach
          the glass and talk to him. Walter just stares back, also
          unsure of what to do. They are caught in awkward moment.
          Finally Walter manages a nod. She nods back and smiles. It is
          the innocent smile of a child.
          
          Suddenly a female guard appears in the doorway and beckons
          the Young Girl back inside. The Young Girl looks at Walter
          one last moment before disappearing behind the door.
          
          
          INT. QUEEN'S DETENTION CENTER, VISITING ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter is talking to Tarek.
          
                              WALTER
                    But I thought you said you went to
                    the hearing.
          
                              TAREK
                    We did. I remember it.
          
                              WALTER
                    So why is there a final order on
                    you? Did he say?
          
                              TAREK
                    No. He didn't know yet. He just
                    said that unless he can find a way
                    to reopen the case quickly they're
                    going to deport me.
          
                              WALTER
                    Maybe you should call your mother.
                    She might have...
          
                              TAREK
                    No. I don't want her to worry. I
                    can handle this.
          
          Tarek shakes his head.
          
                              WALTER
                    Did he say anything else?
          
                              TAREK
                    Yeah. Three years ago I was working
                    for some guy who said he was going
                    to sponsor me for my green card but
                    then he turned out to be jerk. But
                    the lawyer said that might allow us
                    to reopen the case. I don't even
                    understand it.
          
                 59
          
          
          
          Walter nods.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Walter, there are guys who have
                    been in here for years! I can't do
                    that Walter. I'll go crazy.
          
                              WALTER
                    He's trying to deal with the case
                    as quickly as possible.
          
          Tarek goes silent.
          
                              WALTER (CONT'D)
                    Tarek. I have to go back to
                    Connecticut. I'll be reachable by
                    phone if you need me for anything.
          
          Tarek's mind is racing. He shakes his head.
          
                              TAREK
                    OK. Just please...don't forget
                    about me in here.
          
                                 WALTER
                    I won't.
          
                              TAREK
                    Are you still practicing?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              TAREK
                    You should go back to the drum
                    circle.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (Quickly)
                    No.
          
          Tarek laughs.
          
                              TAREK
                    OK. But listen to that Fela CD.
                    That will help you, I promise.
          
                                 WALTER
                    I will.
          
                              TAREK
                    So show me what you've been working
                    on.
          
                    60
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    What?
          
                              TAREK
                    Show me. On that. Come on. I need
                    some music, man.
          
          Tarek points to the shelf in front of Walter.
          
                              WALTER
                    Now?
          
                              TAREK
                    Don't worry. They can't arrest you.
                    At least not yet.
          
                              WALTER
                    OK.
          
          Walter looks around and then cradles the phone in his
          shoulder and starts to bang a simple beat on his counter top.
          Tarek watches and listens for a moment.
          
                              TAREK
                    Ah. There it is. Good. Good. You
                    are getting better.
          
          And then he joins in. The two men continue to play together.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - MORNING
          
          Walter is packing his suitcase. Suddenly there is a knock at
          his door. He exits the room.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter opens the door. Standing there is a strikingly
          attractive forty-five year-old ARAB WOMAN. She seems startled
          to see Walter.
          
                              WALTER
                    Hello.
          
                               ARAB WOMAN
                    I'm sorry. I must have the wrong
                    apartment.
          
          She starts to walk down the hall.
          
                              WALTER
                    Can I help you?
          
                     61
          
          
          
                              ARAB WOMAN
                    I'm looking for my son.
          
                              WALTER
                    Are you Tarek's mother?
          
                                 ARAB WOMAN
                    Yes.
          
                              WALTER
                    Oh. This is Tarek's apartment.
                    I...share the apartment with him.
          
          The Arab Woman is cautious.
          
                              ARAB WOMAN
                    He did not mention that he lived
                    with someone.
          
                              WALTER
                    I'm not here very often. I live in
                    Connecticut.
          
                              ARAB WOMAN
                    Is Tarek here?
          
                              WALTER
                    No. He's...uh...he's not here. But
                    please come in.
          
          Mouna hesitates.
          
                                 WALTER (CONT'D)
                    Please.
          
                                 ARAB WOMAN
                    Thank you.
          
          Mouna walks into the apartment. She stands by the door.
          
                              WALTER
                    I'm Walter. Walter Vale.
          
                              ARAB WOMAN
                    I'm Mouna Khalil. I'm sorry to
                    show up unannounced but my son
                    calls me everyday. He has not
                    called me now for five days. I have
                    tried his cell phone but he does
                    not answer.
          
                              WALTER
                    Would you like to sit down?
          
                 62
          
          
          
                                 MOUNA
                    Thank you.
          
          Mouna sits.
          
                              WALTER
                    Would you like something to drink?
                    Coffee or water?
          
                              MOUNA
                    No. Is my son alright, Mr. Vale?
          
                              WALTER
                    Tarek was arrested. He's being held
                    in a detention center in Queens.
                    They are trying to deport him.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Where is Queens?
          
                              WALTER
                    It's not far from here. Twenty
                    minutes.
          
                              MOUNA
                    You have been there?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. I saw him yesterday. He's OK.
          
                              MOUNA
                    How did this happen?
          
                              WALTER
                    He was stopped in the subway
                    station. He didn't do anything
                    wrong.
          
                              MOUNA
                    I would like to go there. To
                    Queens.
          
                               WALTER
                    OK. But Mrs. Khalil. The lawyer
                    mentioned that...I don't think that
                    you can...
          
                              MOUNA
                    I know I can't visit Tarek, Mr.
                    Vale. I just want to see where they
                    are holding him.
          
                      63
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    OK. I can take you if you'd like.
          
                                 MOUNA
                    Thank you.
          
                              WALTER
                    Let me get my coat.
          
          Mouna nods. Walter leaves. Mouna breathes deeply in an
          attempt to control her emotions. She looks around the
          apartment and spots Tarek's drum. The sight of it is almost
          enough to push her over the edge.
          
          
          INT. SUBWAY - LATER
          
          The Chinese Musician is playing on the platform. Mouna and
          Walter are watching him.
          
          
          INT. SUBWAY CAR - LATER
          
          Walter and Mouna are sitting side by side on the subway.
          
          
          EXT. SUBWAY STATION, QUEENS - LATER
          
          Walter and Mouna exit the subway station and walk down the
          empty street.
          
                              WALTER
                    Have you been to New York before,
                    Mrs. Khalil?
          
                              MOUNA
                    No. Tarek wanted to come to New
                    York to play music. I did not want
                    him to go but...do you have
                    children, Mr. Vale?
          
                              WALTER
                    I have a son. He lives in London.
          
                              MOUNA
                    And your wife?
          
                              WALTER
                    My wife passed away.
          
                                 MOUNA
                    I'm sorry.
          
                       64
          
          
          
          
          EXT. QUEENS STREET - LATER
          
          Walter and Mouna stop across the street from the detention
          Center.
          
                                 WALTER
                    That's it.
          
                              MOUNA
                    This is where the prison is?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. That's it.
          
          Walter points to the Detention Center.
          
                              MOUNA
                    It does not look like a prison.
          
                              WALTER
                    I think that's the point.
          
                              MOUNA
                    How many people are in there?
          
                              WALTER
                    Tarek said about three hundred.
          
                              WALTER (CONT'D)
                    There is a coffee shop on that
                    corner. It's not very nice but...
          
                              MOUNA
                    I'll wait there. Here.
          
          She takes a letter out of her bag and hands it to Walter.
          
                                 MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    Thank you.
          
          Walter turns and walks into the facility. Mouna lingers,
          taking in the building.
          
          
          INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER, VISITATION ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter is waiting for Tarek. He is watching as a LATIN WOMAN
          holds her BABY up to the glass as her HUSBAND taps on it from
          the other side.
          
          Finally a door opens and Tarek walks out. He waves and
          smiles. Walter picks up his phone. Tarek picks up his.
          
                    65
          
          
          
                              TAREK
                    Walter, I thought you were leaving.
          
                               WALTER
                    I was.   Tarek, your mother is here.
          
          This stops Tarek cold.
          
                              TAREK
                    What? My mother?! Where?
          
                              WALTER
                    She is waiting outside.
          
                              TAREK
                    When did she arrive?
          
                               WALTER
                    Today.
          
                              TAREK
                    Oh man. Why did she come? She can
                    do nothing for me.
          
                              WALTER
                    She said she hadn't heard from you.
          
                              TAREK
                    Walter. Listen to me. She can not
                    stay here. She doesn't know anyone
                    in New York. I'm sorry but you must
                    get her to go back to Michigan.
          
                              WALTER
                    OK. OK. Here. I have a letter from
                    her.
          
          Walter takes it out and puts it up to the glass.
          
          
          INT. QUEENS, DINER - LATER
          
          It's a dingy place occupied by truck drivers and factory
          workers. Mouna sitting in a booth clutching a cup of tea. She
          looks very out of place.
          
          Two DETENTION CENTER GUARDS enter and sit down in a booth.
          Mouna watches them. An Arab Waiter is cleaning the counter.
          He keeps looking at Mouna.
          
                              WAITER
                    Do you need anything else?

                    Where are you from?
          
                              MOUNA
                        (In Arabic)
                    I am Palestinian from Damascus.
          
                              WAITER
                        (In Arabic)
                    Ah. I knew it. I am from Egypt.
                    Alexandria. I'm Nasim. Why are you
                    here?
          
                              MOUNA
                        (In Arabic)
                    I am visiting my son.
          
                              NASIM
                        (In Arabic)
                    He is in detention.
          
                                 MOUNA
                           (In Arabic)
                    Yes.
          
          The Waiter shakes his head.
          
                              NASIM
                        (In Arabic)
                    It's a bad place. I'm lucky. I have
                    a green card.
          
          He nods to the Guards.
          
                              NASIM (CONT'D)
                        (In Arabic)
                    They're the ones taking care of
                    your son. They come here everyday.
                    They don't tip.
          
          Mouna is uncomfortable.
          
                              NASIM (CONT'D)
                        (In Arab)
                    Don't worry. They can't understand
                    us.
          
          Walter enters and walks over to Mouna's booth.
          
                   67

                    Hello, sir.
          
          Walter nods and sits down. He hands Mouna her letter.
          
                                 MOUNA
                    How is he?
          
                              WALTER
                    He's good but he's concerned about
                    you being here.
          
                              MOUNA
                    I will not leave.
          
                              WALTER
                    Mrs. Khalil, I'm not sure that your
                    being in New York will do any good.
                    We have a very good lawyer working
                    on Tarek's case...
          
                              MOUNA
                        (Politely but forceful)
                    Mr. Vale, I cannot go back to
                    Michigan knowing that my son is in
                    that building. Even if I can't see
                    him, I will stay.
          
          She stands up, ready to leave.
          
                              MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    Shall we go?
          
          Walter stands. Mouna digs in her purse.
          
                              NASIM
                        (In Arabic)
                    The tea is on me.

                              NASIM
                        (In Arabic)
                    Is that your lawyer? Or your
                    husband?
          
                              MOUNA

          Walter follows Mouna out.
          
          
          EXT. WALTER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER.
          
          Walter and Mouna arrive back at Walter's apartment building.
          Jacob emerges from the front door with Sprinkles.
          
                              JACOB
                    Oh. Hello, Mr. Vale.

                    Hello, Jacob.
          
          He sees Mouna.

                    Oh, hello again. Did you find your

                    I let her in earlier.
                        (To Mouna)
                    I'm Jacob, by the way. I live on
                    the third floor. And this is
                    Sprinkles.

                    So you two know each other?
          
          There is an awkward pause.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Yes. Mr. Vale knows my son.

                    Oh. Who is that?
          
                              MOUNA

                    Oh. Tarek. He is very nice. And so
                    is his girlfriend. They are both so
                    polite.

                    My mother and I are planning a trip
                    to go to Israel next summer. She's
                    always wanted to go.
          
                               MOUNA
                    I hope you enjoy it. Now if you'll

          Mouna nods and heads into the building.
          
                              JACOB
                    Oh sure. We need to go on our walk
                    and do our business. Very nice to
                    meet you, Mouna.
          
                              MOUNA
                    You too, Jacob.
          
          Mouna continues up the stairs. Walter follows her.
          
                              JACOB
                    Goodbye, Mr. Vale.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Goodbye.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN - LATER
          
          Walter and Mouna enter the apartment. Mouna picks up her
          suitcase.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Thank you, Mr. Vale.
          
          Walter turns.
          
                              WALTER
                    Where are you going?
          
                              MOUNA
                    I will find a hotel.

                              WALTER
                    You can stay here. You can use
                    Tarek's room.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Thank you for your offer but I
                    cannot accept this. I don't want to
                    impose on you.
          
                              WALTER
                    You're not imposing. Please. I
                    would like you to stay.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Again, thank you. But I will
                    manage. Goodbye.
          
          Walter finally steps aside and opens the door.
          
                               MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    Goodbye.
          
          She leaves.
          
          
          EXT. WALTER'S APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Mouna walks down the stairs.
          
                              WALTER
                    Mrs. Khalil?
          
          She turns. Walter is standing at the top of the stairway.
          
                               WALTER (CONT'D)
                    Please. I was with Tarek when he
                    was arrested. He was in the subway
                    in the first place because of me.
                    Please. Stay. Even if it's just for
                    the night.
          
          Walter's plea is heartfelt. Mouna looks at him and then she
          looks down the stairs for a long moment, considering her
          options.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, TAREK'S ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter enters the room and sets down Mouna's suitcase. She
          follows him into the cramped bedroom.

                    The bathroom is just across the
                    hall.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Thank you, Mr. Vale.
          
                              WALTER
                    You can call me Walter.
          
                              MOUNA
                    And I am Mouna.
          
          Walter nods.
          
                              WALTER
                    Do you need anything else?
          
                              MOUNA
                    No. Thank you. Good night.
          
                              WALTER
                    Good night.
          
          Walter leaves, shutting the door behind him. Mouna sits on
          the bed and looks around the room.
          
          
          EXT. DETENTION CENTER - NIGHT
          
          Desolate streets. The sound of an airplane taking off breaks
          the night quiet.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - MORNING
          
          Walter walks out of his bedroom. He hears talking from the
          living room. He walks down the hall and sees Mouna sitting on
          the couch in the living room, talking on her cell phone in
          Arabic. He turns and walks back down the hallway.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN
          
          Walter pours a cup of coffee. He notices two newspaper's on
          the counter. One is the Financial Times and the other is Al
          Hayat, an Arabic newspaper. He picks up the Financial Times
          and reads the front page. Mouna enters.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Good morning.

                    Good morning.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Tarek said hello.
          
                                 WALTER
                    How is he?
          
                              MOUNA
                    I can't really tell. He wants me to
                    leave. But I am not leaving.
          
                              WALTER
                    Well, you can stay here as long as
                    you need to.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Thank you. That is very generous of
                    you.
          
                              WALTER
                    Thank you for the newspaper.
          
          Mouna nods and pours some more coffee for herself.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Walter? Did Tarek and his
                    girlfriend, Zainab, live here
                    together?
          
                              WALTER
                    Uhm...Yes. They did.
          
                              MOUNA
                    And where is she now?
          
                               WALTER
                    She's staying with her cousin in
                    the Bronx.
          
                              MOUNA
                    I would like to meet her.
          
                              WALTER
                    We can go by her stall.
          
                                 MOUNA
                    Her what?
          
                              WALTER
                    Her stall. She sells jewelry in a
                    stall.

                    Oh. OK.

          INT. ELEVATOR - SAME
          
          Walter and Mouna are standing in silence.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Do you spend a lot of time in the
                    city?
          
                              WALTER
                    No. Not really. I just came down to
                    present a paper at a conference.
          
                              MOUNA
                    You wrote it?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. Well I coauthored it.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Congratulations.

          INT. MR. SHAH'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Walter and Mouna are talking to the Mr. Shah.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    And what happened after the
                    hearing?
          
                              MOUNA
                    We appealed. It took two years.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    And your appeal was denied?
          
                                 MOUNA
                    Yes.
          
                 74
          
          
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Then they should have sent you a
                    bag-and-baggage letter which
                    basically tells you where to show
                    up and be deported.
          
          Mouna nods.
          
                              MR. SHAH (CONT'D)
                    But you didn't receive it?
          
                                MOUNA
                    No.
          
                                MR. SHAH
                    You sure?
          
                              MOUNA
                    Yes. I would remember this.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Did you move?
          
                              MOUNA
                    Yes. Eventually we had to. But we
                    had our mail advanced.
          
          Mr. Shah is satisfied.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Well, it wouldn't be the first time
                    that happened. And pre 9/11 it
                    wasn't much of a priority tracking
                    people down.
          
          Mouna bristles at the implied connection.
          
                              WALTER
                    So if they didn't get the letter
                    then does this help us?
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    It keeps our chances alive. If they
                    got it and just ignored it then we
                    couldn't push to reopen the case.
          
                              MOUNA
                    So you can help him?
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    It's still a long shot. Like I
                    said, the Government's approach has
                    changed radically.

                    It's very black and white now.
                    Either you belong or you don't.
                    Which means a lot of people who
                    have been living here for years are
                    suddenly being swept up and thrown
                    into detention.
                        (He starts writing)
                    Tarek's lucky. Most of them don't
                    even have lawyers.
          
          Mouna blanches.

                    Lucky?
          
                              MR. SHAH
                        (Without looking up)
                    Relatively speaking. We just have
                    to move quickly to get an emergency
                    stay from the board of immigration.
                    Then, we'll stick with the motion
                    to reopen pending his green card
                    application.
          
          Mouna and Walter share a look. They're lost.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Can you explain what that means?
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Actually, I don't have the time
                    right now. I have to be in court
                    very shortly
          
                              MOUNA
                    How long will he be in detention?
          
                              MR. SHAH
                        (Without looking up)
                    I can't predict that. I'm sorry but
                    I am gonna have to wrap this up.
          
          Walter looks at Mouna. Mouna stares at the Mr. Shah.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Do you have children, Mr. Shah?
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Yeah. Two kids. And for what it's
                    worth my uncle was deported after
                    raising a family here for twenty-
                    three years. If I can get Tarek
                    out, I will.

          Mouna softens.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Thank you. Where are you from?
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Queens.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK STREET FAIR - LATER
          
          Walter and Mouna are standing at the fair.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Which one is she?
          
                              WALTER
                    There. In the middle.
          
                              MOUNA
                        (surprised)
                    The black woman? That is Zainab?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              MOUNA
                    She is very black.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK STREET FAIR - LATER
          
          Zainab is sitting at her table when Walter approaches. Zainab
          smiles. She is genuinely surprised and happy to see him.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Walter?
          
                              WALTER
                    Hi Zainab. This is Mouna Khalil.
                    Tarek's mother.
          
          Zainab blanches.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Oh.
          
          She quickly stands up.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Hello, Zainab.
          
                    77
          
          
          
                              ZAINAB
                    It is a pleasure to meet you, Mrs.
                    Khalil.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Please. Call me Mouna.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    OK. I'm sorry. I did not know you
                    were coming.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Neither did I.
          
          Mouna looks at her for a long moment. Then she inspects her
          jewelry. Zainab is uncharacteristically nervous.
          
                              MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    Your jewelry is very beautiful.
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    Thank you.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Do you have time for coffee or a
                    walk?
          
          Zainab looks around at her table.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Yes. I would like that. But I have
                    to watch my table.
          
          Mouna and Zainab both turn to look at Walter.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK STREET FAIR, - LATER
          
          Walter is sitting behind Zainab's table in the fair. It's a
          long way from the classroom. A FEW YOUNG WOMEN walk past and
          browse Zainab's jewelry. They look at Walter who just nods.
          
          
          INT. CAFE - SAME
          
          Mouna and Zainab sit and talk.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I'm living with my cousin. He has
                    two kids. And his mother. I mean
                    his wife...I'm sorry, I am very
                    nervous.
          
                 78
          
          
          
                                 MOUNA
                    Why?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I don't know. Have you spoken with
                    Tarek?
          
                              MOUNA
                    Yes. He called me this morning. He
                    is doing all right.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I wish that I could see him. Just
                    for a minute.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Me too. How long have you been
                    here?
          
                               ZAINAB
                    Two years. I was in detention when
                    I first arrived. Three months. It
                    was horrible. I would probably
                    still be there but they closed the
                    facility for poor conditions. They
                    released some of the women on
                    parole because we were...low risk.
                    I met Tarek one year later.
                        (Beat)
                    I am sorry for what happened with
                    Tarek. I hope you do not blame me.
          
                                 MOUNA
                    Blame you?     No. I do not blame you.
          
          Zainab starts to break.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Tarek was doing nothing wrong. I
                    miss him so much. I don't know what
                    I am going to do without him.
          
                              MOUNA
                    He said the same thing about you.
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    He did?
          
                                 MOUNA
                    Yes.
          
          Zainab smiles.
          
                    79
          
          
          
                              MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    Zainab, I would like you to do
                    something for me.
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    What?
          
                              MOUNA
                    I would like you to show me
                    something that you and Tarek liked
                    to do. Some place that you like to
                    go.
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    Like what?
          
                              MOUNA
                    Anything. Whatever you want.
          
                             ZAINAB
                    OK. But maybe we should get Walter
                    first.
          
          They both smile at the thought of Walter still at Zainab's
          table.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK STREET - LATER
          
          Walter and Mouna walk down the street listening to Zainab who
          is wheeling her jewelry supplies behind her.
          
          
          EXT. STATEN ISLAND FERRY - LATER
          
          Walter, Mouna and Zainab are standing at the railing of the
          Ferry which is making its way across the harbor.
          
          The STATUE OF LIBERTY looms large; the ferry route providing
          a perfect vantage point.
          
                              MOUNA
                    So what is in Staten Island?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I don't know. We never got off. We
                    just would go to the other side and
                    then come back.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Why?
          
                 80
          
          
          
                              ZAINAB
                    It's free. And it felt like we were
                    going somewhere.
          
          Mouna smiles.
          
                              ZAINAB (CONT'D)
                    That is where the towers were. I
                    never saw them but Tarek did.
          
          Zainab crosses to the other railing and points.
          
                              ZAINAB (CONT'D)
                    And over there is the Statue.    And
                    behind that is Ellis Island.
          
          Zainab smiles.
          
                              ZAINAB (CONT'D)
                    Sometimes Tarek would point at the
                    statue and jump up and down like we
                    were arriving to New York for the
                    first time. It was very funny.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Can you go up in the Statue?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. I think so.
          
                              MOUNA
                    You haven't been?
          
                              WALTER
                    No.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Oh.
          
          Walter's cell phone rings. He looks at it.
          
                               WALTER
                    Excuse me.
                        (Into the phone)
                    Hello? Oh. Hi Charles.
          
          He walks away from the Mouna and Zainab.
          
                              WALTER (CONT'D)
                    What's that? Yes. I'm still in New
                    York actually. I stayed down here
                    to do some research. What's that?
                    Oh. I'm on a boat. Yes, a boat.
                              (MORE)
          
                     81
          
                              WALTER (CONT'D)
                    Listen Charles, I'll explain when I
                    see you but I have to go right now.
                    I'll call you back. Goodbye.
          
          Walter hangs up the phone and rejoins Mouna and Zainab.
          
          
          INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER - LATER
          
          Walter is visiting with Tarek. Another detainee walks behind
          Tarek and taps him on the shoulder. Tarek nods hello and then
          keeps talking to Walter.
          
                              TAREK
                    You went on the ferry?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              TAREK
                    My mother too?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. She liked it.
          
                              TAREK
                    Did Zainab tell you how we used
                    pretend we arriving in New York for
                    the first time?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yeah. She told us.
          
                              TAREK
                    You know they don't even let us
                    outside here. They just cut a hole
                    in the roof in one place.
          
                              WALTER
                    Really?
          
                              TAREK
                    Yeah. It's crazy stuff.
          
          Tarek looks around the room.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    And they seemed to get along?
                    Zainab and my mother?
          
                               WALTER
                    Yes. I think your mother likes her
                    very much.
          
                 82
          
          
          
          Tarek smiles. Then it fades.
          
                              TAREK
                    My mother's not going home, is she?
          
                              WALTER
                    I don't think so.
          
                              TAREK
                    I know she's thinking about my
                    father. He spent seven years in
                    jail in Syria for something he
                    wrote in the newspaper. By the time
                    they released him he was very sick.
                    He died two months later. That's
                    when we came here.
          
                                 WALTER
                    I'm sorry.
          
                              TAREK
                    She thinks the same thing is gonna
                    happen to me.
          
          Tarek thinks for a long moment. He shakes his head.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    You know I have never seen them
                    together. Zainab and my mother.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK STREET, NIGHT
          
          Walter and Mouna are walking home.
          
                              WALTER
                    Are you hungry, Mouna? We can stop
                    for dinner.
          
                              MOUNA
                    I would prefer to cook if you don't
                    mind?
          
                                 WALTER
                    OK.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Should we stop at a market?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yeah. That's probably a good idea.

          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN - LATER
          
          Mouna is preparing dinner. Walter comes in and takes a bottle
          of wine out of the refrigerator.
          
                              WALTER
                    Would you like a glass of wine?
          
                              MOUNA
                    No thank you.
          
          Walter pours his glass.
          
                              WALTER
                    Mouna? I need to go back to
                    Connecticut tomorrow. For work. I
                    told Tarek.
          
                              MOUNA
                    How long will you be gone?
          
          
                              WALTER
                    I don't know yet. I'll try to make
                    it back to visit Tarek as soon as I
                    can.
          
                              MOUNA
                    You don't have keep visiting him,
                    Walter. I'm sure you are busy.
          
                              WALTER
                    I'll see what I can do.
          
                              MOUNA
                    OK. Dinner will be ready soon.
          
          Walter walks out of the kitchen.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - LATER
          
          Mouna and Walter are eating in silence.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Do you go to Broadway, Walter?
          
                              WALTER
                    Broadway? Uhm. No. I haven't been
                    in a long time.
          
                 84
          
          
          
                              MOUNA
                    Tarek sent me the CD for "Phantom
                    of the Opera" for my birthday. The
                    music is lovely. Have you seen it?
          
                              WALTER
                    No. I haven't.
          
                              MOUNA
                    I haven't either but I think I know
                    every word.
          
          Walter smiles. Silence.
          
                              WALTER
                    Tarek is teaching me the drum.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Really? How is it going?
          
                              WALTER
                    Well, I sound a lot better when
                    he's playing with me.
          
          Mouna laughs.
          
                              MOUNA
                    How is your teaching going, Walter?
          
          Walter seems caught off guard by the question.
          
                              WALTER
                    My teaching?
          
                              MOUNA
                    Yes.
          
                              WALTER
                    Well...I have a lighter schedule so
                    I can work on my book.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Your book? What is it about?
          
                              WALTER
                    Well, it covers quite a bit, so
                    it's hard to explain.
          
          Walter drinks his glass of wine.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Are you almost finished?
          
                    85
          
          
          
                                 WALTER
                    I'm close.
          
                              MOUNA
                    You don't like to talk about your
                    work?
          
                              WALTER
                    No. It's just a bit complicated.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Why is that?
          
          Walter is agitated.
          
                              WALTER
                    It just is. It's just not a process
                    that's easy to talk about with
                    someone who's not a writer.
          
          Walter's cheap shot lands. Mouna is stung.
          
                              MOUNA
                    I didn't mean to pry.
          
          There is an awkward silence.
          
                              WALTER
                    I shouldn't have spoken to you like
                    that.
          
                                 MOUNA
                    It's OK.
          
          Walter picks up the wine bottle and fills his glass.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          Walter is sitting on the edge of his bed and takes off his
          shoes. He pauses.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MORNING
          
          An empty New York street. Mouna and Walter round the corner
          walking together. She is holding his briefcase. Walter is
          carrying the drum and his duffle bag.
          
          They arrive at the Parking Garage. Walter hands a ticket to
          the GARAGE ATTENDANT. He takes his briefcase from Mouna.
          
                       86
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    Thank you. You have my number if
                    you need anything.
          
                               MOUNA
                    I'll be fine. Thank you. Have a
                    safe trip.
          
                              WALTER
                    Well good bye.
          
                               MOUNA
                    Goodbye.
          
          Mouna turns and walks down the street. Walter's car arrives.
          
          
          EXT. WALTER'S HOUSE - LATER
          
          Walter pulls into his driveway. He gets out of the car. He
          opens the trunk and takes out his bag and then his drum.
          
          
          INT. CONNECTICUT COLLEGE, CLASSROOM - LATER
          
          Walter walks into the lecture hall. He sets his briefcase
          down.
          
                              WALTER
                    Good afternoon.
          
          He takes out some papers and opens them.
          
          
          EXT. NEW LONDON - LATER
          
          Walter is stopped at a traffic light in town.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S CAR - SAME
          
          Walter sees Karen walking toward him. She is talking on her
          cell phone and does not notice him. Walter just watches her
          pass without saying a word.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S HOUSE, OFFICE - NIGHT
          
          Walter sits in his office working. He stops and listens to
          the silence.
          
                       87
          
          
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S LIVING ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter pours himself a drink and wanders around the empty
          house.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter opens the front door and walks outside.
          
          
          EXT. WALTER'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter walks onto the front lawn and looks around the sleepy
          neighborhood. He listens to the quiet. It's a stark contrast
          from New York.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter roots through his briefcase and pulls out the FELA
          KUTI CD. He slips the CD into the stereo. He presses play.
          FELA KUTI's, "DON'T GAG ME" blares over the speakers.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S HOUSE, PIANO ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter is sitting in a chair and playing the drum along with
          the Fela song. He is only wearing a T-shirt and boxers.
          
          
          INT. CONNECTICUT COLLEGE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
          
          Charles talks to Walter. They stand up and shake hands.
          
          
          EXT. WALTER'S HOUSE - DAY
          
          Three MOVERS are carefully removing the piano from Walter's
          house as Walter and Barbara Watson look on.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S CAR - DAY
          
          Walter drives back down the highway. The Fela Kuti music is
          playing. He is tapping on the steering wheel.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S BUILDING, STAIRWELL - LATER
          
          Walter walks quickly up the stairs to the fourth floor. He
          seems to be moving with a little more pep.
          
                     88
          
          
          
          As he approaches his door, he hears music emanating from his
          apartment. It's a PIANO SONATA. The music stops him in his
          tracks. He listens for a couple of moments. Finally he walks
          inside.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter enters to find Mouna mopping the floor.   Fresh flowers
          are on the table. She sees Walter and smiles.
          
                                 MOUNA
                    Walter.
          
          She turns down the music.
          
                              MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    I did not expect you so soon. I
                    was just cleaning a bit. I hope you
                    don't mind.
          
                              WALTER
                    No. Thank you.
          
                              MOUNA
                    I like this CD very much.   The
                    music is lovely.
          
          She picks up the CD.
          
                              MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    Is it your wife?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              MOUNA
                    She was beautiful.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Thank you.
          
          Mouna sets down the CD. She notices Walter's glasses.
          
                              MOUNA
                    These are different glasses?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Are they new?

                                 WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              MOUNA
                    They're nice.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Thank you.
          
                              MOUNA
                    I was going to make some lunch. Are
                    you hungry?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. Thank you.
          
          Walter leaves. Then he returns.
          
                                 WALTER (CONT'D)
                    Mouna?

                    Yes.
          
                              WALTER
                    I was wondering if...Thursday night
                    ... Do you have plans?
          
          Mouna laughs.
          
                              MOUNA
                    No, Walter, I have no plans.
          
                               WALTER
                    Well, I thought that...we might do
                    something.
          
          
                                 MOUNA
                    OK.
          
                                 WALTER
                    OK.
          
          Walter nods and walks toward his room. Mouna watches him go
          and smiles.
          
          
          INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER, VISITATION ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter and Tarek are talking. Tarek is very anxious.
          
                    90
          
          
          
                              TAREK
                    They keep moving people.
          
                                 WALTER
                    To where?
          
                              TAREK
                    I don't know. I think to other
                    detention centers. Two Moroccan
                    guys were just moved. They had no
                    idea. Suddenly they were just gone.
          
                              WALTER
                    Has anyone said anything to you?
          
                              TAREK
                    No one in here knows anything. I'm
                    not a criminal. I have committed no
                    crime. What do they think? I'm a
                    terrorist? There are no terrorists
                    in here. The terrorists have money.
                    They have support. This is not
                    fair!
          
                                 WALTER
                    I know.
          
                              TAREK
                        (Angrily)
                    How do you know?! You're out there!
          
          Tarek's question stops Walter in his tracks. Tarek tries to
          regain his composure.
          
                                 WALTER
                    I'm sorry.
          
                              TAREK
                    It's just... I'm starting to wonder
                    if I'm ever going to get out of
                    here. I sit in here at night and I
                    keep thinking about Zainab.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    I just want to play my music and
                    live my life. What's so wrong about
                    that?
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK CAFE - DAY
          
          Walter, Mouna and Zainab are sitting at a cafe. Walter is on
          his cell phone.
          
                     91
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                        (Into the phone)
                    OK. OK. Please do. Thank you. Bye.
          
          He hangs up.
          
                              MOUNA
                    What did he say?
          
                              WALTER
                    He would make some calls but they
                    can move him to another facility at
                    their discretion.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    What facility? Where?
          
                              WALTER
                    He said it could be anywhere.
                    Upstate. Pennsylvania. There is
                    even one in Louisiana.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Louisiana? Where they had the
                    floods?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              MOUNA
                    That's so far.
          
                              WALTER
                    Yeah.
          
          
          
                              MOUNA
                    Did the lawyer say anything else?
          
                              WALTER
                    No. No he didn't know anything
                    else.
          
                              MOUNA
                    No one seems to know anything. It
                    feels like Syria.
          
          
          INT. JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT
          
          Darren and the Bass player are playing. They have a new
          drummer. Mouna and Zainab sit at a back table talking.
          
                      92
          
          
          Mouna notices Zainab's necklace. Zainab takes it off and
          gives it to her.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK STREET, KIOSK - DAY
          
          Walter buys two newspapers. One in English and one in Arabic.
          
          
          EXT. STREET - DAY
          
          Mouna walks along the street. She stops at a small CLOTHING
          STORE and looks into the window. She walks into the store.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Mouna is sitting on her bed, speaking in Arabic. Walter,
          dressed in a jacket and tie, is sitting in his bedroom.
          Suddenly Mouna appears in the doorway.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Sorry to keep you waiting.
          
                              WALTER
                    That's alright. How is he?
          
                              MOUNA
                    He says hello. He wants to make
                    sure that you are practicing your
                    drum.
          
          Walter smiles.
          
                              WALTER
                    I am. You look very nice.
          
                              MOUNA
                    You too. Should we go?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes.
          
          They leave.
          
          
          INT. NEW YORK CAB - LATER
          
          Walter and Mouna ride in the cab. Mouna looks out the window.
          
                              MOUNA
                    This city is just so huge! It never
                    ends.
          
                    93
          
          
          
          The cab pulls over. Walter and Mouna climb out.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK STREET - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter pays the Cab Driver and turns to Mouna.
          
                                WALTER
                    Ready?
          
                                MOUNA
                    For what?
          
          Walter points to the "Phantom of the Opera" marquee behind
          her.
          
                              MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    Really? The Phantom? Are we seeing
                    it?
          
                                WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                                MOUNA
                    Now?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. Is that OK?
          
                              MOUNA
                    That's wonderful. Thank you. I am
                    so excited.
          
          Walter smiles as he and Mouna walk toward the theatre.
          
          
          EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT
          
          The lights and sounds of Times Square. Walter and Mouna walk
          through the throngs of tourists after the play. Walter hails
          a cab and they jump in.
          
          
          INT. NEW YORK RESTAURANT - LATER
          
          Walter and Mouna both sit in a French restaurant finishing
          their salad.
          
                              MOUNA
                    I have to say that show was really
                    kind of scary.
          
                    94
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    Yeah. It was kind of scary.
          
          The both smile. A WAITER approaches and picks up their
          plates.
          
                              WAITER
                    Are you finished?
          
                                 MOUNA
                    Yes.
          
                              WAITER
                    How is everything?
          
                              MOUNA
                    Very good. But I think I would like
                    a glass of wine.
          
                              WALTER
                    I'm sorry. I didn't even think to
                    ask.
          
                              MOUNA
                    It's OK. It's not every night that
                    you see The Phantom.
                        (To the Waiter)
                    I'll have a cabernet.
          
                              WALTER
                    Two please.
          
                                 WAITER
                    Certainly.
          
          The Waiter leaves.
          
          
                              WALTER
                    I haven't been to theatre in a long
                    time.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Me neither. There is a place in
                    Syria called Maaloula. It is a huge
                    outdoor theater. It's beautiful.
                    We used to take Tarek there to see
                    concerts.
          
          The Waiter sets down the two GLASSES of wine.

          They clink glasses and drink.
          
                              WALTER
                    Mouna, I've taken a leave of
                    absence for the rest of the
                    semester.

                    Really? Why?
          
          Walter is suddenly self-conscious.

                              WALTER
                    I just thought I might spend some
                    more time in New York.
          
                               MOUNA
                    Walter, you do not have to do this
                    for Tarek.
          
                                 WALTER
                    I want to.
          
                              MOUNA
                    But you have to be in Connecticut.
                    You have your teaching. And your
                    book.
          
                              WALTER
                    It's fine really.
          
                              MOUNA
                    This is not your problem, Walter.
                    It's OK that you are busy.
          
          Her simple words strike a chord with Walter.
          
                               WALTER
                    I'm not busy. Not at all.
                        (Beat)
                    Mouna, the truth is I haven't been
                    doing any work for a long time.
          
                              MOUNA
                    You just presented your paper at

          He is beginning to unravel.
          
                              WALTER
                    I didn't even write it. I just read
                    it. I've been teaching the same
                    course for twenty years. It doesn't
                    mean anything to me. None of it
                    does. I pretend. I pretend that I'm
                    busy. That I'm writing. Working.
                    But I'm not doing anything.
          
          Walter trails off.
          
                                 WALTER (CONT'D)
                    I'm sorry.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Don't be. I appreciate you telling
                    me this.
          
          The Waiter returns and pours some more water.
          
                              MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    Walter, what would you do if you
                    didn't teach?
          
                              WALTER
                    I don't know.
          
                              MOUNA
                    I think that is exciting. Not to
                    know.
          
          Walter considers this as if for the first time. He smiles.
          
                              WALTER
                    Mouna, what do you do?
          
                              MOUNA
                    Do you mean for work?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              MOUNA
                    I work in a car dealership. I take
                    care of the accounting.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Really?
          
                              MOUNA
                    Yes. It's very exciting.

          Walter smiles.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Mouna and Walter walk into the apartment. Mouna takes off her
          coat.
          
                              MOUNA
                    What time is it?
          
                              WALTER.
                    Twelve thirty.

                    No?! Is it?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              MOUNA
                    My God. Twelve-thirty! I have not
                    been up this late in a long time.
          
                              WALTER
                    I think that happens a lot in New
                    York.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Thank you, Walter. That was a very
                    nice evening. It's the most fun
                    I've had in a long time.
          
                              WALTER
                    I told Tarek I was going to take
                    you. He was very happy about it.
          
          Mouna is touched by the comment. Her mood shifts.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Good night, Walter.
          
                              WALTER
                    Good night.
          
          And with that she turns and walks into her bedroom.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S BEDROOM - MORNING
          
          Walter wakes up. He checks his watch. He notices that his
          phone is blinking. A message. He picks it up and listens to
          it.

                    Damn it!
          
          He throws open the door and hurries into the...
          
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Mouna is sitting at the table.
          
                              WALTER
                    There's a message from Tarek.
                    Something's wrong.
          
                              MOUNA
                    What did he say?
          
                              WALTER
                    Just that they were moving him. He
                    didn't know what it meant.
          
          Without another word, Mouna is up and putting on her coat.
          
          
          INT. NEW YORK TAXI - LATER
          
          Walter and Mouna ride in the cab. Walter is on the phone.
          
                               WALTER
                    Well when do you expect him back?
                    Can you have him call me the minute
                    he is? It's an emergency. Thank
                    you.
                         (He hangs up.)
                    He's still in court.
                         (To the CAB DRIVER)
                    Can you hurry please?
          
                              MOUNA
                    I hate this feeling.
          
          
          EXT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER - LATER
          
          Walter and Mouna get out of the cab. Walter rushes in. Mouna
          waits outside.
          
          
          INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER - LATER
          
          Walter walks up to the guard booth.
          
                      99
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    Hello. I'm here for bed 38. Tarek
                    Khalil.
          
          The MALE GUARD checks the computer screen. Walter waits.
          
                              MALE GUARD
                    He is no longer with us.
          
                              WALTER
                    What does that mean?
          
                              MALE GUARD
                    I'm not sure.
          
                              WALTER
                    You're not sure? Was he moved to
                    another facility? Another state?
                    What?
          
                              MALE GUARD
                    I don't know. I just know that this
                    detainee is no longer in the
                    facility.
          
                              WALTER
                    Well can you ask someone who does
                    know?!
          
                                MALE GUARD
                    Hold on.
          
          The Guard picks up the phone and dials. He has a long
          conversation that Walter cannot hear.
          
          There are a few other visitors in the waiting room. They
          watch Walter.
          
                                MALE GUARD (CONT'D)
                    Sir?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. Did you find him?
          
                              GUARD
                    He's been removed.
          
                              WALTER
                    Removed? To where?
          
                                GUARD
                    Deported.

                              WALTER
                    What? When?
          
                              GUARD
                    He was deported this morning.
          
                              WALTER
                    He...how can that be? Is there any
                    way to contact him?
          
                              GUARD
                    I don't know. I don't think so.
          
                              WALTER
                    You don't think so? What kind of
                    answer is that?!
          
                              GUARD
                    I'm sorry, sir. That's all the
                    information that I have. Now please
                    step away from the window. You can
                    call the ICE if you have any
                    further questions. The number is on
                    the wall.
          
          Walter's wheels are spinning. He is helpless. He looks around
          the room at all of the other immigrants visiting friends and
          family members. They are watching him with blank faces.
          
                              GUARD (CONT'D)
                    Sir. Please step away from my
                    window.
          
          Walter doesn't move. He checks his watch.
          
                              GUARD (CONT'D)
                    Sir. For the last time, step away
                    from my window.
          
          Finally, Walter turns and starts to walk out of the detention
          center.
          
          He reaches the exit and then spins around and storms back
          toward the guard booth. He completely loses control.
          
                              WALTER
                        (Angrily shouting)
                    You can't just take people away
                    like that! Do you hear me?! He was
                    a good man. A good person! He had a
                    life here! You can't just take
                    away whoever you want!
                              (MORE)

                              WALTER (CONT'D)
                    It's not fair! We are not just
                    helpless children! Do you hear me?!
          
          The Guard just stares back blankly. The other visitors watch
          in disbelief. They are unaccustomed to this type of outburst
          as is Walter who now stands trembling in the middle of the
          room.
          
          It's as if something inside him snapped. Something that he
          has been holding on to for a long time. He is suddenly
          adrift. Unsure of what to do next.
          
                              MOUNA (O.S.)

                    Walter.
          
          Walter turns. Mouna is standing there. He looks at her.
          Helpless.
          
                              MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    Walter. Let's go. There is nothing
                    we can do. Let's go.
          
          Walter looks a bit lost. He looks back at the Guard who just
          stares back at him.
          
                              MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    Come on, Walter.
          
          She reaches out and takes Walter's hand. And then she leads
          him out.
          
          
          INT. NEW YORK TAXI - LATER
          
          Walter and Mouna ride in a taxi. They are both depleted.
          Mouna shakes her head.
          
                              MOUNA
                    He did nothing wrong.
          
          She is overwhelmed by the events. She breaks down and starts
          to cry. Walter puts his arm around her.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK STREET FAIR - DAY
          
          Walter watches as Mouna tells Zainab. Zainab buckles and hugs
          Mouna.

          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          Walter is looking out the window. Mouna walks out of the
          kitchen and turns out the light. She walks over and stands
          next to Walter.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Walter, I need to go back to Syria.
                    I should to be there for Tarek.
          
                              WALTER
                    When are you going to leave?
          
                              MOUNA
                    Tomorrow. I already bought a
                    ticket. It's best for me to be
                    there as soon as possible.
          
          Walter just looks at her. The news is piercing.
          
                              WALTER
                    You won't be able to come back
                    here.
          
                                 MOUNA
                    I know.

                    Mouna. I'm sorry.
          
          Mouna smiles warmly.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Good night, Walter.
          
          Mouna leans in and kisses him gently on the cheek. She turns
          and walks toward her room. Walter watches her go and then
          looks back onto the street.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - LATER
          
          Walter is lying awake in bed. There is a knock at the door.
          He sits up.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yes.
          
          The door opens and a shaft of light cuts across the room.
          Mouna stands in the doorway.
          
                    103
          
          
          
          Walter stares at her for a moment and then turns down the bed
          sheets. Mouna walks over and lies down next time. Walter
          pulls the sheets back over her.
          
          They sit in silence for a long moment holding each other.
          
                              MOUNA
                    It's my fault. What happened to
                    Tarek. I did receive the letter
                    telling us to leave. I threw it
                    away. I never told him.
          
          Walter can only listen.
          
                              MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    We were here for three years by the
                    time the letter arrived. I had
                    found a job. Tarek was in school.
                    Everyone told me not to worry. That
                    the government did not care. And it
                    appeared to be true. And then,
                    after time, you forget. You think
                    that you really belong.
          
          Walter gently touches her.
          
                              WALTER
                    It's not your fault.
          
          He puts his arm around her and she collapses into him.
          
                              WALTER (CONT'D)
                    It's not your fault.
          
          They lie together.
          
          
          INT. KENNEDY AIRPORT - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Mouna and Walter are sitting in the airport.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Have you visited your son in
                    London?
          
                              WALTER
                    No. Not yet.
          
                              MOUNA
                    You should visit him.
          
          Mouna takes a small decorative pouch out of her purse.
          
                   104
          
          
          
                                 MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    Here.
          
          Walter takes it and opens it. It's a WRIST BAND from Zainab's
          collection.
          
                              MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    Zainab and I picked it out
                    especially for you.
          
                              WALTER
                    Thank you. It's very nice.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Let me see.
          
          Mouna puts it on Walter's wrist.
          
                                 WALTER
                    I like it.
          
                              MOUNA
                    So do I. You look cool.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Cool?
          
                              MOUNA
                    Yes. You are very cool, Walter.
          
          Walter smiles. Mouna checks her watch.
          
                              MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    I should go.
          
          The both stand up.
          
          
          INT. KENNEDY AIRPORT, SECURITY CHECKPOINT - LATER
          
          Walter and Mouna arrive at the security check point. Mouna
          sets down her bag.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Thank you, Walter. For everything.
          
          She leans in and they hug long and hard.
          
                              WALTER
                    I don't want you to go.
          
          Mouna kisses him.
          
                    105
          
          
          
                              MOUNA
                        (She whispers)
                    I don't want to go, habibi.
          
          Then she picks up her bag and walks off. Walter watches her
          go. She turns and waves. Walter waves back and then she
          disappears into the security check point.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY
          
          Walter walks quickly along the street with his drum.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK STREET - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter approaches the subway and enters.
          
          
          INT. SUBWAY STATION - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter swipes his card and walks down into the subway.
          
          
          INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter walks along the subway platform. He stops about midway
          and sits down on a bench.
          
          The uptown subway train enters and obscures our view of him.
          
          Finally the train pulls away. Walter is still sitting but now
          he is playing his drum.
          
          He is fully committed.
          
          Another train wipes frame.
          
          
          EXT. STREET FAIR - DAY
          
          Zainab sits behind her table, staring straight ahead. We hold
          on her for a long moment and then...
          
                                                        CUT TO BLACK

BLACK

A young man's V.O.:

                         ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
           I was born in Beaufort, North
           Carolina. A place where the air
           always smells of pine and salt and
           sea.

The voice is gentle. Slightly Southern in inflection.   A
young doctor's soothing manner.


FADE IN:


EXT. COASTAL NORTH CAROLINA (DECEMBER) (PRESENT)

A vast view of the coastline in winter -- beaches, rivers,
sea marshes, inlets -- ebbing and flowing.

                         ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
           For many, days and nights are
           spent fishing Pamlico Sound or
           crabbing the Neuse River.

The CAMERA FINDS a small coastal town, edged by a harbor
on which fishermen toil.


EXT. BEAUFORT, NORTH CAROLINA - MORNING (DECEMBER)

The CAMERA, MOVING inland, CROSSES OVER modest houses
decked with plastic rooftop Santas...

                         ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
           While the ocean may be the focus
           of daily labor, churches have
           always tried to be the focus of
           life.

And MOVES UPHILL TO...


EXT. MAIN STREET

Where fake snow is sprayed on store windows. The CAMERA
CONTINUES TO the far side of Main Street -- with its
stately homes with big lawns, flower beds, and tasteful
Christmas garlands.

                         ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
           When I lived here, there were
           eighteen churches within town
           limits alone.

                                                       2.

EXT. FOUR-WAY STOP

From each corner, four churches face each other. The
Fellowship Hall Christian Church, the Church of the
Forgiven People, the Church of Sunday Atonement, and All
Saints Church.

                        ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
          They sponsored pancake breakfasts,
          rummage sales, car washes, and
          softball games.


EXT. LANDON'S TRUCK - TRAVELING

The CAMERA FINDS and FOLLOWS a newish sport utility
vehicle with MD plates as it passes a rummage sale and a
softball game.

                        ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
          You'd think that all the people
          here were friendly, welcoming,
          open-hearted...

Dr. LANDON CARTER, 33, drives the truck.


INT. CAR - TRAVELING

Landon looks urban, prosperous, well-groomed -- but
retains his boyish whimsy and sense of irony. A cell
phone and overnight bag on the seat next to him.

                         ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
          ... and that money or family
          background or education or luck
          didn't matter.

Landon reaches out to adjust his side mirror, revealing a
simple gold wedding band on his left hand.


EXT. STREET - TRAVELING

Landon's truck turns the corner and slows in front of the
huge Southern Baptist church.

                        ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
          But they did matter. They
          mattered to everyone. Except
          Jamie Sullivan...

Landon's truck turns into a driveway just past the church
and heads for a cluster of buildings. Behind the
buildings, a cemetery.

                                                        3.

EXT. CLUSTER OF BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The truck pulls up in front of the old parsonage -- it's a
different color than he remembers.

                        ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
          ... Astronomer. Actress.
          Believer in God...

Landon hesitates a moment, then climbs out of his truck.


EXT. OLD PARSONAGE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Landon heads up the walk and onto the front porch.
Presses the DOORBELL. It RINGS inside. Landon is edgy,
unsettled.

                        ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
          ... Believer in me.

A nurse opens the door.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH GYM - NIGHT (NOVEMBER, 1985)

ROCK MUSIC drifts out open doors -- barely recognizable as
"Born in the U.S.A." Students hang. Brains, preps,
richies, heavy metals, jocks, punk rockers, goths, geeks.
Mixing without mixing. Most are red-eyed, woozy, wasted.
A couple of boys break dance to a BOOM BOX.

Missing are the criminals...

A shiny T-top CAMARO ROARS up. Stops, TIRES SQUEALING.
VAN HALEN BLASTING. LANDON, 18, at the wheel. He is
impulsive, sexy-troubled, with the nothing-to-lose courage
to act on destructive whims. He is envied, copied,
feared.


INT. CAMARO

EMPTIES roll and CLINK on the floor. A tiny plastic
skeleton dances as it hangs from the rearview mirror.
Landon stamps a joint into the ashtray.

                        LANDON
                 (impatient, edgy)
          Where is he? He's supposed to be
          here.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                              4.

CONTINUED:

                           ERIC
                    (from back seat)
             I need to whizz.

ERIC's skinny, high-energy.          A leg always jiggling.

                             LANDON
             Eric.    You're such a hummingbird.

                              BELINDA
             I wanna dance.

BELINDA is Landon's girlfriend. Richie princess, a bad-
girl pretender. Big shoulder pads. Jellie bracelet.
Swatch watch.

                              LANDON
             So go dance.

                              BELINDA
             With you.

                              LANDON
             I.    Don't.   Dance.

                           ERIC
                    (pointing, like
                     Tattoo)
             Dee plane. Dee plane.

They laugh.       Clay's by the dumpster.


EXT. DUMPSTER

CLAY, obese, wearing a too-small student monitor vest, is
dumping garbage from a trash can. A loud HONK. Clay
turns to see the Camaro, then turns back to the school,
coast clear. He quickly heaves in the empty trash can as
the Camaro pulls up.

Eric pushes a door open.       Empties fall from the back seat.
Clay climbs in.

                              CLAY
             Go go go go.

PRINCIPAL ED KELLY, middle-aged, pockmarked skin, Casio
calculator watch, exits the gym.


INT. CAMARO

Landon's looking at Kelly in the rearview mirror.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                          5.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
                    (mocking)
             Kelly. He looks like his face
             caught fire and he tried to put it
             out with a fork.

Landon inches the car forward, teasing Clay, teasing
Kelly.

                           ERIC
             He couldn't find his own butt with
             both hands at high noon in a hall
             of mirrors.

Sniggering laughter.

                           CLAY
             Go!

Landon presses the gas.    The CAR ROARS away.

                           CLAY
             Kelly's so old he --

                           LANDON
             We're done with that already,
             bonehead.

Clay smiles, good-natured.    He often misses social cues.


EXT. CAMARO - TRAVELING

Landon drops Clay's student monitor vest out onto the
road. Another car runs it over.


EXT. ROAD

Mr. Kelly walks over, picks up the vest. Shakes it.
Frustrated. Eyes the empty beer bottles by the dumpster.


EXT. OUTSIDE CEMETERY GATE - LITTLE LATER

Camaro is parked on the dirt access road, headlights
shining through the locked rear gate. JOHN COUGAR
MELLENCAMP's "Small Town" playing.


INT. CAMARO

Landon, Clay, and Belinda sit drinking, smoking weed.
Under the MUSIC, a CB RADIO scanner CHATS quietly.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                         6.

CONTINUED:

                           ERIC (O.S.)
             So which is it?


EXT. CAMARO

Eric finishes taking a leak.

                           ERIC
                    (calling over,
                     repeating)
             Landon. To save your life, you
             have to either go deaf or go numb
             in your dick and balls.

Eric climbs back in the car.


INT. CAMARO

Landon, Belinda, Clay, Eric.

                             LANDON
             I'm thinking.

                           ERIC
             No thinking. The doctor only
             gives you three seconds to
             decide --

                           LANDON
             Could I lose one ear and one nut?

                           ERIC
             No questions, no negotiating --

                            BELINDA
                    (to Eric, annoyed)
             Where do you get these stupid
             questions -- ?

                           LANDON
             Hypotheticals --

                           ERIC
                    (to Belinda)
             I'm just wondering --

                             BELINDA
             Don't wonder.

Landon's looking out at the night.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                        7.

                           LANDON
             Jamie Sullivan.

Everyone looks up.     Derisive laughter.


THEIR POV

A pale, contemplative GIRL, 17, is jumping down off the
gate, caught in the headlights. Wearing clothes she
probably made herself; long hair hiding her face. She
lives in her mind, not her body.


BACK TO SCENE

                            BELINDA
             Brain.

                            ERIC
             Bible freak.

                            LANDON
             Cherry.


EXT. CAMARO

JAMIE (GIRL), hearing the laughter, gathers herself and
approaches Landon's window, her SNEAKERS CRUNCHING in the
GRAVEL. She crosses her pilly brown sweater across her
chest.

                           JAMIE
                    (to Landon,
                     tentative)
             Hey. Hi. Your lights. Any
             chance you could... turn them
             off --

                           BELINDA
                    (leaning over
                     Landon)
             God give you this road?

                            JAMIE
             No --

                           BELINDA
             Then we'll be keeping the lights
             on.


                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                              8.

CONTINUED:

                            LANDON
                    (to Jamie, seeming
                     nice)
             If you want the lights off, I'll
             turn them off.

And he does.    Darkness.

                            JAMIE
             Thank you.   Thank you so very
             much.

She backs away from the car, grateful.        From the car:

                           BELINDA (O.S.)
             I can't see a friggin' thing.


INT. CAMARO

Landon switches on the dome lights for Belinda.

                           BELINDA
                    (imitating Jamie)
             'Thank you. Thank you so very
             much.'

But Landon's looking at Jamie.     Almost counting the
seconds...


HIS POV

Jamie scaling the fence, practiced at it.


BACK TO SCENE

Landon quickly flicks the high beams.     Belinda, Eric, and
Clay snicker and snort as they see --


EXT. CEMETERY GATE

Jamie, startled, paused at the top. But instead of
looking bullied, her face shows determination, humor even.
A moment later, she jumps down on the far side.
Disappears.


INT. CAMARO

Belinda, Eric, Clay are still laughing.       Landon's smiling.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                      9.

CONTINUED:

                           ERIC
             Ten years. Where're you gonna be?
                    (to Belinda, mocking)
             Hypothetically?

                            BELINDA
             Paris.

                            CLAY
             Dead.

Laughter.

                            LANDON
             Right here.   With you.

He clinks Eric's raised beer. More laughter. But
Landon's face clouds slightly -- maybe this isn't where
he'd really like to be.

                           CLAY
             'Twilight Zone.' 'One Step
             Beyond.' 'Tales from the Dark
             Side.'

                           ERIC
             'Twilight Zone,' dipshit.

                           LANDON
             Don't call him a dipshit.

                            ERIC
             You do --

                            LANDON
             And you don't.
                    (beat, re: Jamie)
             What's she doing in there?

                           BELINDA
             Nothing I'd be doing.

Laughter.    Landon kisses her.      With tongue.

A blinding white light dances through the car and settles
on Landon and Belinda's faces.

                            LANDON
             Shit!

He scrambles out of the car.


EXT. CAMARO

Landon looks up at the fence.

                                                            10.

LANDON'S POV

Jamie sitting atop, holding a large mirror, reflecting the
headlights back into the car.


BACK TO SCENE

They stare at each other.   His annoyance turns to mild
respect.

The CB RADIO comes to life inside the car.     A GARBLED
TRANSMISSION.

                          BELINDA (O.S.)
          Landon!


INT. CAMARO

Landon leaps in.    Pops out the Van Halen.

                          LANDON
          The address?!

                          ERIC
          York Ave.

Landon pops in a WHAM! tape.     AMPS it UP.   "Freedom."

                          LANDON
          What number?

Nobody answers.

                          LANDON
          Dildoes.

Landon turns the car around.


EXT. ACCESS ROAD

The Camaro fishtails away. TIRES CRUNCHING, red
taillights bouncing on the rough road. The car turns left
onto the paved road and speeds out of sight.


INT. CAMARO

Landon drives recklessly.   Rushing.   He makes a SCREECHING
turn.


LANDON'S POV - STREET AHEAD

Two fire trucks rumbling by houses, SIRENS WAILING.

                                                            11.

EXT. CAMARO

Turns right, following the fire trucks.


INT. CAMARO

Landon smiles at Belinda. She smiles back. Fun. Landon
takes a slug of beer. Turns his eyes back to the road.


LANDON'S POV - FIRE TRUCKS

make another turn. Then a flash of light, movement.         A
figure on the road.


EXT. ROAD

An old man walking his little dog.     Crossing the street.


INT. CAMARO - LANDON

turns the wheel hard.      Jams his foot on the brake.


EXT. ROAD

The Camaro swerves.     TIRES SQUEALING.   A LOUD, HEART-
SEARING THUMP.

The old man -- sideswiped, drops to the asphalt.

The CAMARO SLAMS into a light pole.     CRUNCHING METAL.
TINKLING GLASS.


INT. CAMARO

Quiet.   Landon, Eric and Clay are banged up.

                            CLAY
            Christ, man.

                            LANDON
            You okay?

                            ERIC
            Yeah.

Belinda's head leans on the dash. Her shoulders shake.
Landon, bleeding on the forehead, reaches over. Scared.

                            LANDON
            Belinda?

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                            12.

CONTINUED:

She lifts her head.     Looks at him.   She's laughing.   He
kicks his door out.


EXT. STREET

The Camaro crumpled into the light pole. Headlights
askew. Clay and Eric and Belinda getting out, dazed.

Landon runs to the old man. Kneels. Shakes him.       No
response. The man's TERRIER BARKS at Landon.


LANDON'S FACE

Frightened, anguished.     The real Landon showing for an
instant.

Police SIRENS WAIL in the b.g., growing LOUDER.


EXT. OLD CHEVETTE - HALF HOUR LATER

A battered Chevette steers through a working-class
neighborhood.


INT. CHEVETTE

Landon's mother, CYNTHIA, 35, drives. She's weary with
sun-worn skin, but still attractive. She wears a skimpy
black-and-white cocktail waitress uniform under her coat.

                           CYNTHIA
             What if they expel you?

                           LANDON
             Kelly wouldn't do that.

                            CYNTHIA
             Why not?

                           LANDON
             Cuz nothing happened at school.

He smiles his biggest most reassuring smile.

                           CYNTHIA
             Don't smile at me. It's not going
             to get you out of this.

                            LANDON
             Why not?   It always has before.

                                                          13.

EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH - MONDAY (7:59 AM)

By daylight, a modern brick and glass structure.


INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - 8:05 AM

Mr. Kelly gestures for Landon to sit.   Landon doesn't.
His forehead still shows a bruise.

                        MR. KELLY
          I had hopes for you.

                        LANDON
          Like I'd grow up to be president,
          another Reagan.

                        MR. KELLY
                 (not laughing)
          Like you'd make it to June. Even
          cutting half your classes, you
          have a B- average.

                          LANDON
          I'm no dummy.

                          MR. KELLY
          That's right.    You just act like
          one.

On his desk, he places the empty bottles that rolled out
of the Camaro.

                        LANDON
          Those aren't mine.

                        MR.KELLY
          They came from your car.

                        LANDON
          I wasn't the one drinking.

Kelly holds up the police test finding.

                        MR. KELLY
          Your blood alcohol level. Maybe
          you were legally in the clear, but
          I make the rules here.

Landon scowls, knows he's defeated.

                        LANDON
          You expelling me?

                          MR. KELLY
          I am.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                         14.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
             Now I can do what I want.

                           MR. KELLY
             That's right.
                    (sarcastic)
             The world is your oyster.


EXT. SCHOOL ENTRANCE - MINUTES LATER

Landon busts out, arms high, fists tight, like a righteous
political prisoner. Freedom. He struts through the
courtyard. Not a care in the world.


EXT. CARTER DRIVEWAY - HOUR LATER

Landon watches a tow truck lower the crumpled Camaro. A
neighbor kid, JOSH, 12, watches from across the street, on
his way to school.


EXT. CAMARO - MINUTES LATER

Landon pokes and prods his car -- the engine, underneath,
the body, the paint. A discouraging mess.


INT. CARTER HOUSE - HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

Landon knocks on Cynthia's bedroom door.

                            LANDON
             Mom.   I need a ride.


INT. CYNTHIA'S BEDROOM

Dark. She wears a black eye-shield.      Her waitress uniform
hangs over a chair.

                           CYNTHIA
                    (sleepy, annoyed)
             I'm not getting up to drive you
             somewhere.
                    (beat)
             What're you doing home?


EXT. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

Landon lifts the garage DOOR.

                                                        15.

LANDON'S POV - INSIDE GARAGE

A murky place.   Filled with old tools and junk and a grim
old bike.


EXT. MINI-MALL - AUTO PARTS SHOP - LITTLE LATER

Landon comes out the glass door, his arms loaded, sees his
bike. No way to carry. He looks around. The bus stop.
A bus approaching.


EXT. UNDER CAMARO - LATER

BANGING, RATCHETING, CLINKING. Landon's working hard.    A
BOOM BOX playing SIMPLE MINDS' "Alive and Kicking."


LANDON'S POV - HIS MOTHER'S LEGS

and worn terry slippers appear.

                        CYNTHIA (O.S.)
          I want to talk to you.

He pauses, annoyed, then rolls himself out.


EXT. CARTER DRIVEWAY

The mangled front bumper's on the ground. Cynthia stands
there in her bathrobe. Upset. Landon's almost too much.

                        CYNTHIA
          You're not hanging round here all
          day.

                        LANDON
          I'm not hanging. I'm fixing my
          car --

                        CYNTHIA
          You don't need a car you can't
          drive for a month. Go see Marvin.

                          LANDON
          'Bout what?

                          CYNTHIA
          About a job.

Landon ignores her.    Slides back under his car.

                                                        16.

EXT. UNDER CAMARO

                        CYNTHIA (O.S.)
          He's going to try you as assistant
          manager.
                 (beat)
          You could be manager someday.

Landon can't believe this.


EXT. DRIVEWAY

Landon slides back out.

                        LANDON
          I'm not working there.

Cynthia sets her jaw.   He knows that look.


INT. RESTAURANT - KITCHEN - LUNCH HOUR

Landon is sweating, scouring pots. A crooked cap on his
head, an assistant manager name tag on his shirt. He's
making some headway; only two more to wash.

MARVIN, the owner, walks over. Beer belly, greasy hair.
Dumps another pile of dirty pots and pans in Landon's
sink. Landon glimpses his future.


INT. PRINCIPAL KELLY'S OUTER OFFICE - EARLY AFTERNOON

Landon paces, jumpy. Kelly's secretary, MISS TARBOX,
quietly locks her purse in her bottom drawer.

                        LANDON
          Who's he in with?

                        MISS TARBOX
          He'll be with you when he's
          available.

The door to Kelly's office opens. Jamie Sullivan exits
with her father, the tall stern REVEREND HEGBERT SULLIVAN.
Jamie eyes Landon as she passes by.

                        LANDON
                 (joking)
          You expelled, too?

Nobody laughs or even smiles.

                                                        17.

INT. PRINCIPAL KELLY'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Mr. Kelly makes a note in Jamie's file.

                        MR. KELLY
          Finding the real world to your
          liking, Mr. Carter?

                        LANDON
          I want to come back.

                         MR. KELLY
                  (looking up,
                   surprised)
          Back?   Were you ever really here?

They both know Kelly has the upper hand.   Kelly leans back
in his chair, relishing it.

                        LANDON
                 (mumbling)
          I want to graduate.

Kelly studies Landon, the boy who can't get out of his own
way.

                        MR. KELLY
                 (thinking aloud)
          You could grace our hallowed halls
          again, if, while you're here, you
          make a sincere effort to be part
          of our little school community --

                         LANDON
                 (relieved)
          I'd do that --

                        MR. KELLY
          How would you do that, Mr. Carter?

Landon shrugs, clueless.

                        MR. KELLY
                 (smiling)
          Shall I give you a few ideas?

                           LANDON
                    (smiling, too)
          Please.

                        MR. KELLY
          Besides attending all your regular
          classes, I'd like you to help our
          janitorial staff after school --

             For pay?

                           MR. KELLY
             For the inner satisfaction it will
             bring.
                    (beat)
             Saturday mornings, I'd like you to
             tutor disadvantaged students at
             our sister school --

                           LANDON
                    (joking)
             I'm as underprivileged as they
             are --

                           MR. KELLY
             The fact that you attend this
             school makes you privileged.

His tone quiets Landon.

                           MR. KELLY
             Finally, I'd like you to join the
             drama club. Rehearsals are
             Tuesday and Thursday evenings.

                           LANDON
                    (grumbling)
             I'd work backstage or something?

                           MR. KELLY
             Or something. They're doing a
             play for the holidays.

                           LANDON
             When do I get time for me?

                            MR. KELLY
             You don't.   That's the point.

Landon's not happy, but he'll work with this.     As he heads
for the door:

                           MR. KELLY
                    (softer, trying to
                     reach him)
             Landon, none of us faculty see you
             the way you see yourself.
                    (beat)
             Some of us remember how your
             father --

                           LANDON
             Then you remember more than I do.

                                                          19.

INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM - AFTER SCHOOL

Landon sweeps at the floor during the Star Club open
house. A dozen nerds, including Jamie Sullivan (wearing
her brown sweater), stand at astronomy exhibits. Students
wander in, listen, look.

                        JAMIE
                 (answering question)
          -- Saturn's 15 degrees to the
          right of red Antares and much
          brighter.

To her small audience, she holds up a contraption made
from a wire coat hanger.

                        JAMIE
          This is a very simple device made
          from a coat hanger, plastic wrap
          and typewriter correction fluid.
          Does anyone know what it is?

No one does.

                        LANDON
                 (barely audible)
          A star frame.

But Jamie hears.   She regards him a moment, then keeps
going.

                        JAMIE
          This is a star frame.

Clay and Eric enter, checking on Landon, glancing at
Jamie.

                        JAMIE
          A star frame will help you locate
          stars and planets with your naked
          eye --

                        CLAY
                 (scoffing, setting
                  her up)
          -- Did God create the sun?

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                             20.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
                    (taking him seriously)
             Yes, God created the universe and
             all its physical laws. Even
             Einstein said it's a miracle that
             our world is comprehensible --

                           ERIC
             -- If God can do all that, why
             can't he get you a new sweater?

Landon laughs loudly.    Members of the club look at him.

                           LANDON
             That was a joke. Laugh.

Jamie smiles.    She can laugh at herself.     And she finds
Landon funny.


INT. CARTER KITCHEN - EVENING

Landon washes up while his mother sets the table.      The
MICROWAVE HUMS in the b.g.

                           CYNTHIA
             Your father dropped off an extra
             check.

                           LANDON
             I don't want his money.

                           CYNTHIA
             It could help with a new car --

                           LANDON
             -- I like the car I have.

He picks up the envelope with wet hands. Without looking
inside, rips it in half. Cynthia smiles, quietly happy.


INT. SCHOOL BUS - TRAVELING - SATURDAY MORNING

Enthusiastic preppies, richies, other do-gooders, singing
"Karma Chameleon." Jamie sits in an aisle seat, reading,
not singing. She turns around to look at Landon.    He
rides in the back row, staring out the window, wearing a
Sony Walkman, glum.


HIS POV

To Z.Z. TOP'S "Sleeping Bag." Out the window -- Jefferson
High School coming into view. Bars on every window,
chain-link fence around the parameter, no grass.

                                                          21.

INT. JEFFERSON HIGH - LIBRARY - LITTLE LATER

A big room with tables and chairs but few books. Pairs of
heads are bent over textbooks and notebooks. Landon sits
with LUIS, a freshman boy of mixed ethnicity. A geometry
text between them.

                        LANDON
                 (reading)
          -- 'So what is the measure of
          angle x if A and B are similar
          triangles?'

Luis is lost, intimidated.

                        LANDON
          Know what 'similar' means?

Luis shrugs. Luis looks down at the book as if for the
answer, then at Landon, hopeless. He gets up and walks
off. Landon looks up in disbelief and catches Jamie
studying him. She's at a nearby table with her student,
ISABEL.


INT. SCHOOL BUS - NOON

The DOOR SWISHES SHUT behind Landon as he hops aboard.
He's late and heads for the rear bench seat.


LANDON'S POV

Jamie sitting there.   And no vacant seats save next to
her.


BACK TO SCENE

The bus begins to roll.   Landon lurches forward.


TRAVELING - LATER

The bus is moving through Beaufort. Landon sits next to
Jamie. Putting a new tape into his Sony Walkman. His
body turned away. She's reading her book.

                        JAMIE
          You going to visit Harold?

Landon scowls.   What-who is she talking about?

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           22.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
             They let him out of the hospital
             yesterday. He's in a rest home on
             Oak Street.

That old man.

                           JAMIE
             He goes to my father's church.   He
             could've died --

                           LANDON
             -- This your idea of small talk?

                           JAMIE
             I don't make small talk --

                              LANDON
             -- Obviously.

                           JAMIE
             I just wanted to tell you not to
             give up. Sometimes you've got to
             back into the teaching from
             somewhere else.

If he heard her, he makes no sign.     She goes back to her
book. A long beat, then:

                            JAMIE
             What makes you volunteer?
                    (pause)
             Want to know why I tutor reading?

Not really.

                           JAMIE
             Because, growing up, books were my
             world.

                              LANDON
                     (mean)
             Were?

                           JAMIE
             You don't know me.

                           LANDON
             Your book and your brown sweater
             and your hair. What's more to
             know -- ?

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                        23.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
             -- I wear the sweater because I'm
             cold. I read because no one talks
             to me. My hair is my hair. What
             is it exactly that's bothering
             you?

                           LANDON
             You don't care what people say?

                           JAMIE
             You mean care what you say? I'm
             worrying about other things.

                            LANDON
             Like what?   The moons of Jupiter?

                           JAMIE
             Can't you have a normal
             conversation?

                           LANDON
             I don't want to have any
             conversation.

                           JAMIE
             Good, cuz talking to you is like
             trying to explain red to a blind
             person.

She reads again. The bus pulls to a stop in front of
Beaufort High. Belinda, wearing a neck brace, is waiting,
leaning on her Cabriolet. Jamie watches Landon exit the
bus.


JAMIE'S POV - OUT THE WINDOW

Landon greeting Belinda, kissing her.


INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - TUESDAY EVENING

Landon opens a side door, peers in at the Drama Club.


LANDON'S POV

A big space with a stage. MS. GARBER stands before six
geeky boys, and a dozen fat girls and Jamie.

                                                       24.

BACK TO SCENE

Landon reacts -- this girl actually chooses to be in these
places? Ms. Garber looks up from her papers.

                        MS. GARBER
          We're waiting, Mr. Carter.

He slides in a row behind the others. Leans forward and
pokes a boy, EDDIE JONES. Eddie's pimply and talks with
his eyes squinched up.

                        LANDON
          What's the play?

Eddie hands him a photocopied script, The Rainmaker.

                        EDDIE
          The-the-there's this drought an'
          -- and a smooth t-t-alking guy
          comes and says he can m-make
          rain --

                        LANDON
          -- And the ugly farmer's daughter
          falls for him. I saw the movie.

                         EDDIE
          Yeah.   It's really g-g-good --

                           LANDON
          -- It blows.


ON STAGE - MINUTES LATER

Jamie and Landon sit in folding chairs, reading from
scripts. Landon's wooden, showing how lame this is.

                        LANDON
                 (as Starbuck)
          'I hope your dreams come true.'

                        JAMIE
                 (as Lizzie, sad)
          'They won't.'

                        LANDON
                 (as Starbuck)
          'Believe in yourself and they
          will. Let me ask you, Lizzie.
          Look in the mirror? Are you
          pretty --?'

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                          25.

CONTINUED:

                           MS. GARBER
             -- Landon, are you trying to be
             bad at this?

                           LANDON
             No, it just comes naturally.

Jamie smiles.    Garber taps her script -- continue.

                           LANDON
                    (as Starbuck)
             'It's got to be inside you. Then
             one day the mirror will be the
             eyes of the man who loves you.
             You'll look in that mirror and
             you'll be more than pretty.
             You'll be beautiful.'

Ms. Garber eyes Landon, motions for him to keep going.

                           LANDON
                    (as Starbuck)
             'Look at me. Tell me what you
             see!'

As Lizzie, Jamie looks into his eyes.

                           JAMIE
                    (as Lizzie)
             'Is it really me?'

                           LANDON
                    (as Starbuck, hamming)
             'Yes. You're-you're b-b-
             beautiful.'

Hoots and laughter.    Jamie looks away, humiliated.

                           MS. GARBER
             Quiet!
                    (announcing)
             Landon will play the role of Bill
             Starbuck.

Groans among the boys.    Jamie is horrified.    So is Landon.

                           LANDON
                    (to Garber)
             No way. No thanks. I can't do
             it --

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                          26.

CONTINUED:

                            MR. KELLY (O.S.)
                     (offstage)
             -- You can and you will, Mr.
             Carter.

Kelly's been standing in the wings.

                           MR. KELLY
                    (warning)
             With all the sincerity and dignity
             you can muster.

Everyone stares at Landon.     He's trapped.


EXT. AUDITORIUM - LATER THAT EVENING

Raining. Landon exits behind all the others. Stands
under an overhang, lights a cigarette, angry, waiting for
a ride. Jamie approaches, something on her mind.

                           LANDON
                    (rude)
             You're like this fly, buzzing
             buzzing everywhere --

                           JAMIE
             -- This play means a lot to me.

                            LANDON
                    (snorting)
             This play -- ?

                           JAMIE
             -- I know you don't suck at
             acting.

Landon laughs. Refusing to take her seriously. Behind
him, the lights go out as the school closes for the night.

                           JAMIE
             But you have to make it a big joke
             because only dorks and dweebies
             like doing theater --

                           LANDON
             -- What are you going on about?

Pause.

                           JAMIE
             I can judge too.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                          27.

CONTINUED:

He exhales, eyeing her, daring her.

                           JAMIE
             You don't care about classes or
             graduating. But you like school
             because you're popular and you
             know you'll never be on top again.

                              LANDON
             That's deep --

                           JAMIE
             -- Your act only works with an
             audience.

                              LANDON
             My act?!

She walks off toward her father's old Pontiac.     The last
car in the parking lot.

Fire trucks rush by on the street below. Landon's ears
twitch. He looks about. No one, no ride. He sees the
Pontiac backing out of a parking spot.


EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

Landon bangs on the side of her car as she drives past.

                            LANDON
             A ride?!   Please!


INT. PONTIAC

Jamie turns to look at him.


JAMIE'S POV

Landon, wet, desperate, his eyes pleading.

                            LANDON
                    (insincere)
             We can talk about your helping me
             with my lines.


INT. OLD PONTIAC - TRAVELING - MOMENTS LATER

Jamie's at the wheel.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                            28.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
             I know you don't want help.

                           LANDON
             Then we both know.
                    (beat)
             I'll point. You drive.    Faster.

He points the way, to the taillights of the fire trucks.
The wet road glistens.

                           JAMIE
             We're following fire trucks?

                              LANDON
             Yeah.

                              JAMIE
             Why?

                           LANDON
                    (duh)
             Because that's where the fire is?

He fishes in his pocket for a tape. Pulls one out.      He's
searching the dash -- no cassette player.

                           LANDON
             Fire is like a living thing.
             Wild. Unpredictable.

                              JAMIE
             Like me.

                             LANDON
             No.    Not like you.

She jerks the car across the center lane. Driving on the
wrong side of the road. He grips the dash.

                              LANDON
             What the -- ?!

                           JAMIE
             So you agree you need help?


LANDON'S POV - OUT WINDSHIELD

Headlights looming, a car coming.      Closer and closer.

                                                         29.

BACK TO SCENE

                             LANDON
           Yes!

She swings the Pontiac back to the right lane. Smiling.
A car zips by in the other direction, HORN BLARING.

                             JAMIE
           Really?

Landon drops his attitude, his act.   He toys with the
glove compartment knob.

                         LANDON
           Yeah. Kelly'll make me leave
           school if I screw up the play.

                         JAMIE
                  (to herself)
           28 and 42.

Pause.   He acts like he doesn't hear, but he's interested.

                         LANDON
           What's with the friggin numbers?

                         JAMIE
           28 is do something illegal.   42 is
           befriend an enemy.

                             LANDON
           I'm an enemy?

                             JAMIE
           Kinda.    Yeah.


EXT. ACROSS STREET FROM FIRE - LITTLE LATER

Landon and Jamie walk around the fire, watching the fire
and the firemen. Landon is just tolerating her.

                         JAMIE
           The reason I got the part... I'm a
           little like Lizzie. Except I
           don't worry about some man
           rescuing me.

                             LANDON
           Good thing.

If she's offended, she keeps it to herself.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             30.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
             You got some kind of list?

                           JAMIE
             Are you asking to mock me or do
             you really want to know?

                           LANDON
             Maybe a little of both.

They both smile.

                           JAMIE
             I'll take a chance.

                             LANDON
             Go for it.

                           JAMIE
             It's like a to-do list, but for my
             life.

He smirks.

                           JAMIE
             If you can't imagine the future,
             you won't have one.

He lights a cigarette.       She reaches for it.

                           LANDON
                    (joking)
             Having a cigarette. 100.

She grins and takes a drag.      They share the cigarette.

                           LANDON
             So what else is on this list?

                             JAMIE
             It's private.

                           LANDON
                    (cajoling)
             You want to tell me...

She eyes him, not certain she's willing to risk sharing
her dreams with him.

                           LANDON
                    (guessing, rudely)
             Get very wasted. Lose your
             virginity --

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                        31.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
                    (correcting)
             Spend a year in the Peace Corps.
             Make a medical discovery --

                           LANDON
                    (contemptuous)
             Ambitious.

                           JAMIE
             Being negative's a lot more work
             than being positive.

                           LANDON
             Like you'd know.

                            JAMIE
             I do know.
                    (pause)
             Be two places at once... learn to
             hit a baseball or turn a
             cartwheel... eat breakfast with
             chopsticks...

He likes the frivolity of these.

                           LANDON
             What's... Number one?

She looks away, embarrassed.

                           JAMIE
                    (changing subject)
             If you want help with your lines,
             I have two conditions.
                    (smiling)
             You have to promise not to fall in
             love with me.

He's certain she's joking.

                             LANDON
             No problem --

                           JAMIE
             And you have to meet my father.

He looks at her like she's crazy to worry about this.

                           LANDON
             Fathers love me.

                                                       32.

CLOSE ON PARSONAGE FRONT DOOR

swinging open. Reverend Sullivan looming tall.   Ichabod
Crane in a collar.


EXT. PARSONAGE PORCH - WIDER - NEXT EVENING

Landon gives a cheery little wave. He's very sweaty.   His
bike teeters on its kickstand in the b.g.

                         LANDON
          Hey.   Landon Carter.

Landon offers his hand. The Reverend shakes reluctantly,
eyeing him closely: Landon's Army boots, torn jeans,
dirty t-shirt, aloof manner.

                        REV. SULLIVAN
                 (surprised)
          You're in the play?

                          LANDON
          Lead man.

Jamie slides out the door. She looks good in jeans and a
white t-shirt. Almost normal. In the b.g., Landon's BIKE
CRASHES over. He bounds down the porch steps.

                        LANDON
                 (explaining bike)
          They took my license for 30 days.
          But nobody's pressing charges.

The Reverend looks at Jamie, concerned. Landon tries the
kickstand, then leans the bike against a carefully trimmed
bush. Not the best place.

                        JAMIE
          I'll get something for us to
          drink --

                          LANDON
          Don't bother!

But she's already gone.   The Reverend gestures toward the
open front door.


INT. SULLIVAN LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Dark and prim with stiff furniture left to fade. Landon
pokes around, then stares at a photo of little girl Jamie
with her parents. He looks up, aware that the Reverend is
studying him closely.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                            33.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
             You know our planet would not
             suffer for one nanosecond if
             humans died off. But if ants
             disappeared, that would be
             catastrophic.

The Reverend waits, letting Landon suffer the silence.

                           LANDON
                    (confidence flagging)
             Apropos of nothing... so. So so
             so so --

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             Let's get something straight. You
             don't know me. I don't know you.
             But I know what you're about.
                    (beat)
             Keep your distance from this
             house -- and from Jamie.

His eyes lock with Landon's. His message clear. A NOISE
and Jamie is there, carrying glasses of lemonade, all
cheerful.

                           JAMIE
             I miss anything?


INT. PARSONAGE - KITCHEN - MINUTES LATER

Jamie washes the lemonade glasses, happy.      Her father
comes in.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             The Carter boy. Tell me about
             him.

                           JAMIE
             He wants help with his lines --

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             He was driving the car that hit
             Harold Keene --

                              JAMIE
             By accident --

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.
                    (beat)
             Is this really the best time to be
             making a new friend...?

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                         34.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
             I'm supposed to always be alone?

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             I don't want you to see him
             outside school activities.

                           JAMIE
             Fine. But I need to start
             deciding how to spend my time and
             my life.

Pause.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
                    (gentler)
             I'm sorry your mother isn't here
             to help you become a woman.

                           JAMIE
             Dad, I've become a woman without
             her. Just not a pretty one.


INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - ONE AM

Jamie hops out of bed, pulls on jeans and a sweatshirt.


INT. HALLWAY

Jamie peers into her father's room. He's sleeping.     She
tiptoes to the staircase and down. Sneaking out.


EXT. REAR ACCESS ROAD TO CEMETERY - TEN MINUTES LATER

Landon is waiting when Jamie appears. He has scripts in
his back pocket. They smile at each other, laugh.

                          JAMIE
                    (re: her father)
             I know. Don't say anything.

                           LANDON
             He's a softy. Got him wrapped
             around my finger.

                             JAMIE
             You think so.

                             LANDON
             Know so.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                           35.

CONTINUED:

She grins, skeptical.

                              JAMIE
             This way.


ANOTHER ANGLE

Jamie leads Landon toward the cemetery rear gate.

                           JAMIE
             People think I'm strange, don't
             they?

                            LANDON
                     (smiling)
             Yes.

                           JAMIE
             Because I try to be nice to
             people?

                              LANDON
             Yeah.   Maybe.    I dunno.

                           JAMIE
             Do you think I'm strange?

Pause.   Landon's caught off-guard by her frankness.

                            LANDON
             Yeah.   But that can be good.


EXT. CEMETERY - REAR GATE - NIGHT

Jamie quickly scales the fence.       Landon's right after her.

                           LANDON
             Why are we here?


INT. CEMETERY

Jamie drops down.     Takes a flashlight from her bag.

                           JAMIE
             Cuz it's dark and quiet and you
             can see into another world.

                           LANDON
                    (on top of gate)
             The world of the dead?

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                             36.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
                    (being mysterious)
             Could be...

He drops down, not sure what she means.      She's already
walking away. He follows.

                           JAMIE
             My mother's buried near here.

                           LANDON
             My father's alive but it's like
             he's dead.

She looks at Landon, feeling his sorrow, then unlocks a
storage shed. Opens the door. Enters. Returns a moment
later carrying several pieces of an odd-looking home-made
cylindrical device.

                             LANDON
             What is that?

                            JAMIE
                    (proud)
             That is my telescope.


SAME SCENE - MINUTES LATER

The ten-inch Dobsonian telescope is pointed at the sky.
The eye-piece is at the end of the long scope; the scope
rests on a plywood base. Landon looks through the eye-
piece.


POV (THROUGH TELESCOPE) - CLOSE ON GOLDEN PLANET

a beautiful view of a golden planet with a broad, flat
ring system.

WIDEN.

                    (impressed)
             Saturn. Beautiful.

                            JAMIE
             Before Voyager we expected maybe a
             dozen rings --

                           LANDON
             But there are thousands of them,
             made of floating ice --

                                                           37.

             Maybe debris from a moon that
             broke apart.

                           LANDON
             Or building blocks for a world
             that never formed.

She looks at him.    He smiles, embarrassed.

                              LANDON
             I'm not smart.     Just a sponge.

She smiles, disagreeing, then looks through the telescope
and changes its view.

                           JAMIE
             Sometimes I come here and just
             scan the heavens.

                           LANDON
                    (joking)
             Looking for intelligent life?

                           JAMIE
             Looking for something -- someone.

Pause.   He doesn't know what to say.

                           LANDON
             Do you believe you'll see your
             mother again?

                           JAMIE
             I hope so.
                    (beat)
             I think maybe she sees me now.

Their eyes meet.     She looks away.    Changes the subject.

                           JAMIE
                    (re: telescope)
             I'm building a larger one to see
             the nucleus of Haley's Comet --

                           LANDON
             The dirty snowball at its core.

                              JAMIE
             Yeah.
                    (beat)
             I'm probably not going to be
             around next time it comes.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                         38.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
             In 76 years, me neither.

She likes that he knows a little about astronomy. They
each lean back on a tombstone and stare at the stars.

                           LANDON
             You're really into God, right?

                           JAMIE
             In ten words or less?

                           LANDON
             Yeah.

                           JAMIE
             My relationship with God is my
             own.

                           LANDON
             But you think about Him -- It --
             Her.

                           JAMIE
             Don't you?

                           LANDON
             Not really.

Pause.

                           JAMIE
             When you do, how do you?

Landon could joke or he could reveal something.

                           LANDON
             Like in a church painting. I see
             this giant hovering over the
             ground. He's wearing a robe, and
             has long flowing hair, and he's
             pointing his finger at something.

                           JAMIE
             Do you ever wonder why things
             happen the way they do?

                           LANDON
             No.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                    39.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
             I know there's a plan for
             everyone, but sometimes I don't
             understand what the message is --
             or what the point is.

                           LANDON
             There is no point. You live.     You
             die. The end.

                           JAMIE
             Maybe we're not supposed to
             understand, but we're supposed to
             have faith that someone else sees
             the big picture.

                           LANDON
             You have to believe to have faith.

                           JAMIE
             You don't believe in anything?

                           LANDON
             The Bible. Why should I read a
             bunch of dumb stories about some
             ancient guy who supposedly worked
             miracles.

                           JAMIE
             Interpreted by another guy like my
             father.

                           LANDON
             Your father doesn't like me.

Pause.

                           JAMIE
             He doesn't trust you.

                           LANDON
             Sometimes I don't even trust me.

He sits up and pulls Rainmaker scripts from his back
pocket. He holds one out to her. A moment passes. She
takes it.

                           JAMIE
             I'm not afraid of you.

                           LANDON
             Likewise.

                                                          40.

INT. PARSONAGE - HALLWAY - LATER THAT NIGHT

Jamie sneaks from the stairs to her room. Shuts the door.
A light glows under the door, then goes out.


INT. REVEREND SULLIVAN'S BEDROOM

He opens his eyes, listens, then turns over and goes back
to sleep. Not suspecting. Not yet.


INT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Dreary. Landon lies in bed, flipping the TV CHANNELS,
past "Square Pegs," "Miami Vice," MTV, to a British nature
documentary. After a moment, he searches for a pen and
paper. Titles it "Life List." Pause. He doesn't know
what to write.


EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH PARKING LOT - MORNING (BEFORE SCHOOL)

Landon, Clay, Eric, Belinda. Eric's pickup is parked by
Belinda's Cabriolet. RADIOS ON, BLASTING the same
station, same song: JOHN FOGERTY's "Rock and Roll Girls."

                           ERIC
             Women are definitely evolving into
             men.

                           CLAY
             The moustaches on some girls.
             Unbelievable.

                           BELINDA
             Why is Jamie Sullivan staring at
             us?

They look.    Jamie's watching them.   They laugh.

                           ERIC
             She wants to jump Landon's bones.

                           BELINDA
             That is so pitiful.

                           LANDON
             She's very confused.

                           CLAY
             Deluded.

                           ERIC
             Deranged.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           41.

CONTINUED:

                            LANDON
             Demented.

                           BELINDA
             She's coming over here...

                           LANDON
             Heart be still.

They laugh more and she's there.

                           JAMIE
                    (to Landon)
             Hi.

He doesn't respond.      She shifts from foot to foot.
Confused.

                           JAMIE
             The play's going to be really
             good.

                           LANDON
                    (mocking her)
             I'm really glad you think so.

His friends snicker and guffaw.      She looks at them, then
back to Landon.

                            JAMIE
             I guess you don't want to practice
             lines tonight.

                           LANDON
             You guessed right.

She gives him a funny look and walks away.      A better
person than he and he knows it.

                           BELINDA
             That's one girl who can't take a
             hint.

                           LANDON
             Because she doesn't know what a
             hint is.

They laugh. Landon the loudest.      It feels good, but he
also feels a little... bad.


INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

Cleaned up. Swept out. The Camaro is still a dented
mess. But Landon drops its hood down, wipes his hands,
and climbs behind the wheel. The ENGINE STARTS.

                                                          42.

INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

No posters of pop stars. Books by Houston Smith, Thomas
Merton, Alan Watts, Carlos Castaneda. Jamie studies,
listening to JONI MITCHELL's "I Wish I Had a River." The
DOORBELL RINGS.


INT. FRONT HALL - MOMENTS LATER

Jamie opens the front door. Landon. A stern voice from
the living room. Reverend Sullivan's.

                        REV. SULLIVAN (O.S.)
          Better not be the Carter boy.

Jamie shuts the door.


EXT. SULLIVAN FRONT PORCH

Landon can't believe this.   He presses the BELL again.

                          LANDON
                   (talking to door)
          Jamie?
                 (beat)
          Open up.
                 (beat)
          Open the door. Please.
                 (long beat)
          Reverend Sullivan, I have to talk
          to your daught--

                        JAMIE
          What is your problem?

She's standing in the front yard.

                        LANDON
          You're not in a very good mood.

                        JAMIE
          You don't miss a thing.


WIDER

He steps down off the porch.

                        LANDON
          The play's in a couple of weeks.

                          JAMIE
          Yes.   And?

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                         43.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
             I was hoping we could run lines
             together.

                            JAMIE
             Oh.   Just not at school...

                            LANDON
             Yeah --

                           JAMIE
             Or anywhere where people might see
             us.

                           LANDON
             Belinda's a very jealous person.

                           JAMIE
             That would be the reason.

Pause.   He thinks she might be going for this.

                           JAMIE
             So it's like you want to be secret
             friends.

                           LANDON
             That's it! Exactly! You're
             reading my mind --

                           JAMIE
             Then maybe you can read mine.

She walks up the porch steps, goes in the front door, and
opens it. Before she goes in:

                           JAMIE
             I thought I saw something in you,
             something good. But I was wrong.


INT. SULLIVAN FRONT HALL - MOMENTS LATER

Jamie leans against the closed door, trembling, almost
crying. In the living room, her father looks up from his
reading, sees Jamie, then parts the curtains, looks out,
glowers.


REVEREND SULLIVAN'S POV - OUT WINDOW

Landon standing in the front yard, confused that Jamie
would reject his generous offer of friendship.

                                                        44.

EXT. FRONT YARD

Landon walks to his car, then yells back at the parsonage.

                        LANDON
          Why do you have to be so weird?!

The front door opens, startling Landon. It's the
Reverend. Red-faced with fury. Landon glares back, but
then climbs in his car and drives off. Ashamed.


INT. PARSONAGE - LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER

Jamie sits on the sofa.   Her father doesn't look up from
his reading.

                        REV. SULLIVAN
          The first time I met him I knew.
          I'm proud of how you're handling
          yourself.

Tears well and Jamie's face cracks with guilt and
heartbreak. She leaves before her father can see her
distress.


INT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

Landon lies in bed watching another British nature
DOCUMENTARY, this one on astronomy. He reaches for his
school yearbook. Flips the pages until he finds Jamie's
photo.


CLOSE ON JAMIE'S PHOTO

She's smiling and looks almost cute. Listed under her
photo are clubs: Red Cross, Stars and Planets, Drama.
Ambition: To Witness a Miracle.


INT. JEFFERSON HIGH - LIBRARY - SATURDAY MORNING

Landon and Luis sit over the geometry text. Landon has
just asked a question and Luis is shrugging sadly.
Landon's eyes wander out the window.


LANDON'S POV - BASKETBALL HOOP


BACK TO SCENE

                        LANDON
          Let's get outta here.

                                                         45.

EXT. JEFFERSON HIGH - BASKETBALL BLACKTOP - MINUTES LATER

Landon and Luis face each other across the half-court.
Landon's got a ball and is further from the basket.

                        LANDON
          You, me, and the basket. We're
          the three corners of a triangle.
          Take one step in.

Landon and Luis both step forward.

                        LANDON
          Am I at the same angle to you and
          the basket as before?

                          LUIS
          Yeah.

                          LANDON
          Are you?

                          LUIS
          Yeah.

                        LANDON
          So what did we just make?

                        LUIS
          A similar triangle?

                        LANDON
          What else? What kind of triangle
          has three sides of different
          lengths.

                          LUIS
          Scalene?

                         LANDON
          Okay.   Make me an isosceles.

Luis steps outward, directly opposite Landon.

                          LANDON
          Yes!    Two sides the same.

Landon tosses him the ball. They play. Jamie glances
over from a picnic table where she works with her student,
Isabel. Landon looks at her, she looks away, he looks
back. Thoughtful. Watching her. But not staring.


INT. BOOK STORE - EVENING

Landon studies the books in the spiritual/religion shelf.
                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                        46.

CONTINUED:

He picks out a book, then sits in a corner.

But before he opens the text, he looks around him,
suddenly taking in all the books, all the learning, all
the knowledge that could be his.


EXT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - WEEK LATER

On the marquee: The Rainmaker. Under this, "All
Invited." Under this, a full parking lot.


INT. AUDITORIUM

A full house. Parents, teachers, students, churchgoers,
booster club and rotary members.


ON STAGE

The set is a wealthy Midwestern ranch house of the 1950s.
Eddie and two other BOYS play other characters. The
play's underway...


STAGE LEFT

Landon watches, dressed as Bill Starbuck in a nicely
fitted suit. Waiting for his entrance.


LANDON'S POV - STAGE

                           BOY #1
                    (as H.C., the father)
             'Then why don't you talk to her?'

                           EDDIE
                    (as Jim)
             'Because if we do, she'll think
             we're trying to get rid of her.'

                           BOY #1
                    (as H.C., the father)
             'She'll sure think the same if I
             do it. You're her father and
             comes a time when a father's gotta
             mention.'


BACK TO SCENE

From stage right, Jamie makes her entrance as Lizzie.   A
collective gasp from the audience.

                                                       47.

LANDON'S POV

Jamie, wearing makeup, a dress that clings, her hair
pulled back.


BACK TO SCENE

Landon can't take his eyes off her.

                         JAMIE
                  (as Lizzie)
           'Morning, Pop. Boys. I dreamed
           we had a rain, rain coming down in
           sheets! Lightning flashed,
           thunder rolled up and down the
           canyon like a kid with a big
           drum!'


AUDIENCE

Reverend Sullivan -- enraptured. Principal Kelly --
hopeful. Cynthia Carter -- uncertain. Clay, Eric, and
Belinda -- rocking in their seats, snickering.

                         JAMIE
                  (as Lizzie)
           'I know why you sent me to
           Sweetriver. Six boys in that
           family. The first three days, I
           stayed in my room.'

                         BOY #2
                  (as Noah, the
                   brother)
           'What'd you do that for?'


BACK OF AUDITORIUM

A well-dressed man, DR. JONATHAN CARTER, Landon's father,
slips in and takes a seat a couple of rows behind Cynthia.

                         JAMIE (O.S.)
                  (as Lizzie)
           'I knew what I was there for and
           they knew it, too!'


BACK OF AUDITORIUM - LATER

Dr. Carter hangs on every word. Others sit on the edge of
their seats. Even Clay, Eric, and Belinda. Belinda leans
forward to take a photo.

                                                       48.

BELINDA'S POV THROUGH CAMERA LENS

As she ZOOMS -- Landon and Jamie on stage, growing larger.


ON STAGE

Landon, Jamie, and the three boys.


ON STAGE - LANDON

is Starbuck.

                         LANDON
                  (as Starbuck,
                   genuine)
           '... You'll look in that mirror
           and you'll be more than pretty.
           You'll be beautiful. Look at me.
           Tell me what you see!'

Jamie looks. She sees something in his eyes she hasn't
seen in them before. Love.

                         JAMIE
                  (as Lizzie, choked
                   up)
           'Is it really me?'


LANDON'S POV

Jamie, her face lovely. Her eyes shining, radiating,
looking directly at him.


BACK TO SCENE

Landon is dumbstruck.

                           LANDON
                    (as Starbuck,
                     heartfelt)
           'Yes.
                  (beat)
           You're beautiful.'

Landon changes the line and nails it. Surprising himself.
Surprising her. They both know it's sincere. A moment
passes. Her stomach churns with anticipation.

He leans in. She closes her eyes. They kiss. Gently,
genuinely. When Jamie opens her eyes, they are filled
with tears.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                           49.

CONTINUED:

The curtain crashes down.    End of act two.

CLAPPING from the other side of the curtain. Landon tries
to meet Jamie's gaze. But she's looking at the floor.


AUDIENCE

Principal Kelly, pleased. Cynthia Carter, proud. Clay
and Eric, surprised. Reverend Sullivan, frowning,
concerned. Belinda's face is cold, hard.


EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - HOUR LATER

Landon runs out, looking for his friends.      Mr. Kelly
shakes his hand, then deals with parents.


LANDON'S POV

Belinda getting into her car.


WIDER

                           LANDON
             Belinda!

Belinda stops.

                           BELINDA
             What?!

She waits.    Landon struggles with what to say.

                           BELINDA
             That's what I thought!

Landon watches her START her CAR, back from a parking
space --

                           DR. CARTER
             Landon.

Landon turns.    His father is standing on the curb.

                           DR. CARTER
             Fine performance.

                           LANDON
             Who invited you?

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                                50.

CONTINUED:

                             DR. CARTER
             Ed Kelly.    I thought we might get
             a bite --

                             LANDON
             Not hungry.

Landon moves toward his Camaro.

                          DR. CARTER
             Landon! Please. Don't walk away
             from me.

                           LANDON
             Like you walked away from us?

Landon opens his car door and gets in.         Not forgiving.


INT. BEAUFORT HIGH - CORRIDOR - NEXT MORNING

Landon waits by Jamie's locker.       The BELL RINGS.   No
Jamie.


INT. CAFETERIA - NOON

Landon walks along the lunch line, looking.        No Jamie.


INT. LIBRARY - LATER

Many many books. Landon cruises the stacks. No Jamie.
Belinda, sitting at a table with a girlfriend, sees Landon
and turns away. He doesn't pursue it.


EXT. CARTER DRIVEWAY - DUSK

Eric and Clay watch Landon hammer out dents in the Camaro.
They're smoking, sharing some beers. Josh, the neighbor
kid, stands across the street, wanting to be invited over.

                           ERIC
                    (contemptuous)
             She's like some Puritan.

                             LANDON
             She's not.    She's got her own
             ideas.

                             CLAY
             Mutant ideas.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                             51.

CONTINUED:

                             LANDON
             Maybe to you.

Eric and Clay exchange a look -- is Landon defending her?

                            ERIC
             Belinda's telling everyone that
             kiss was real.

                             LANDON
             It was.

Eric and Clay smirk in disbelief.

                           ERIC
             And that you're scamming on Jamie
             Sullivan.

                           LANDON
                    (not denying it)
             Scamming's a strong word.


INT. BEAUFORT HIGH - CORRIDOR - NEXT MORNING

Landon's waiting when Jamie approaches her locker. Her
hair pulled back. She looks good in a simple, fresh way.

                           LANDON
             You weren't in school yesterday.

                           JAMIE
             I went to the doctor with my
             father.

                             LANDON
             He okay?

                           JAMIE
             Healthy as can be.

Pause. She doesn't help him.          She opens her locker, gets
what she needs.

                           LANDON
             You were great the other night.

                            JAMIE
             Thank you.   So were you.

Pause.   He tries to touch her hair.       She ducks.

                           LANDON
             I haven't been nice to you.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                           52.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
             You're hardly nice to anyone.

                           LANDON
                    (sincere)
             I'm sorry.

                           JAMIE
                    (walking away)
             I wish I could believe you.


INT. CAFETERIA - LATER

Jamie sits alone, reading, wearing her old brown sweater.
Landon walks by Clay and Eric at a table.

                           ERIC
             Landon!

                           LANDON
             Later.

Puts his tray down on Jamie's table and sits.      Making a
public statement.

                           JAMIE
             People can see.

                           LANDON
             And that would ruin your
             reputation how?

She goes back to her book.    Ignoring him.

                          LANDON
                    (re: her book)
             What's that?

She doesn't look up.    Shows him the spine:     The Scarlet
Letter.

                           JAMIE
             I'm reading all the novels on Mr.
             Rothberg's best American authors
             list.

                           LANDON
             How many books are there?

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                             53.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
                    (annoyed)
             A hundred. Then there's his
             classics list. And his European
             list.

Landon realizes this is why she's always reading.

                           LANDON
             That on your 'Life List.'    To read
             all those books?

She doesn't deny it.       He just dives in.

                          LANDON
             Jamie. Maybe I want to try being
             positive.

She looks up.    Examines his face for the truth.

                           LANDON
             Maybe I miss doing that dumb play
             with you.

Students seated near them have overheard.      Whisper.

                           LANDON
             Maybe you inspire me.

                           JAMIE
             That sounds like horseshit.

                             LANDON
             Which part?

                             JAMIE
             All of it.

                             LANDON
             It's not.

                             JAMIE
             Prove it.

She picks up her books and tray.      Everyone is watching.

                             LANDON
             I just did!


EXT. PARKING LOT - AFTER SCHOOL

Landon follows Jamie out of the building.      Catches up.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                             54.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
             Jamie --

                           JAMIE
             You lack honor. You lack
             compassion. You lack honesty.
             You lack humanity.

She heads to the old Pontiac.       Landon jogs after her.

                          LANDON
             Okay. Maybe some of that is
             true --

                           JAMIE
             You don't know the first thing
             about being someone's friend --

                           LANDON
             I don't want to be just your
             friend --

                           JAMIE
             You don't know what you want --

                           LANDON
             You don't either. Take a look at
             yourself. Maybe you're scared
             that someone might actually like
             you --

                           JAMIE
             And why would that scare me?

                           LANDON
             Because then you couldn't hide
             behind your books and your
             telescope and your sweater and
             your God.

She gets into her car. Slams the door.        STARTS the
ENGINE. She recognizes the truth.

                           LANDON
             But the real reason you're scared?
             You like me!

She drives off. Clay and Eric, watching, guffaw at
Landon's spectacle.

                           LANDON
             If you were really my friends,
             you'd be helping me, not running
             me down.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                          55.

CONTINUED:

                           ERIC
             The only one running you down is
             you.


EXT. BRIDGE OVER INTERCOASTAL WATERWAY - NIGHT

Landon sits alone. Legs dangling over. Lighting and
dropping matches into the black beyond his feet. His body
caught in the occasional sweep of car headlights.

Nearby, an abandoned car.     A rusty old Yugo.


INT. CARTER KITCHEN - NIGHT

Landon comes in from outside. Is surprised to find
Cynthia sipping tea, wearing her uniform.

                           CYNTHIA
             Out with Belinda?

                            LANDON
             That's over.   Way over.

                           CYNTHIA
             I can't know things if you don't
             tell me.

Pause.

                           LANDON
             Dad came to the play.

                           CYNTHIA
                    (surprised)
             You saw him?

                           LANDON
             We talked. He wanted to get a
             bite -- after. I said no.

                           CYNTHIA
                    (disbelief)
             After he moved out, I invited him
             to every practice, every game,
             every parent-teacher conference
             you ever had. He didn't show, not
             once.

                           LANDON
             He wants to show now.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           56.

CONTINUED:

                           CYNTHIA
             You going to let him? You going
             to reward him by being the son he
             was never man enough to be a
             father to?

Landon doesn't answer.

                              CYNTHIA
                    (angry)
             You do that.


INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE SCIENCE LAB - NEXT AFTERNOON

The door is open to a lab where Jamie and the Star Club is
meeting. Landon mops, working hard, while listening in.
Inside, Jamie ignores him.


Mr. Kelly watches from near the trophy case.      Almost
approving.

                           MR. KELLY
             Mr. Carter. Don't wear a hole in
             that one spot there.

Landon grins and moves on. Behind Landon's back, Mr.
Kelly peeks into the science lab. Sees Jamie. Looks back
at Landon. Wonders.


EXT. JEFFERSON HIGH - SATURDAY (DECEMBER)

Landon parks his Camaro.       It's shiny and buffed and
perfect again.


INT. JEFFERSON HIGH - LIBRARY - MINUTES LATER

A Christmas party for the tutors and tutored. A ROCK 'N'
ROLL CHRISTMAS CD plays. A raffle ticket box by the door.
A sign reads: "Win Movie Tickets."

Landon enters, buys a ticket, then takes off his leather
jacket. Underneath, a nice shirt and tie.


LANDON'S POV

Across the room -- Jamie, looking pretty in a dress,
laughing with her student, Isabel. Mr. Kelly talking with
MR. REGINALD ADAMS, principal of Jefferson High.

Luis runs over, diverts Landon's attention.

                                                          57.

FRONT OF ROOM

Mr. Adams goes to a microphone.      Taps it.

                           MR. ADAMS
             Everyone? Quiet please. As you
             all know, we're here to celebrate
             the holidays and to raise money to
             buy books for our library. The
             book drive is being led by
             Beaufort High's Jamie Sullivan.

Applause. This is new. Landon looks at Jamie, who's
smiling. She steps to the microphone.

                           JAMIE
             Thank you for buying tickets.
             We've raised two hundred and
             eighty-five dollars.

More applause.    She steps down.


LANDON AND LUIS

Off to one side.

                           LANDON
                    (to Luis)
             About enough to buy maybe five
             volumes in a set of encyclopedias.

Luis smiles.    Jamie overhears.

                             JAMIE
             It's a start.

                           LANDON
             Yeah, with a finish in about a
             decade.

She smiles.    He looks at her.

                           LANDON
             So you're talking to me?

                           JAMIE
             When I have something to say.

He smiles.

                           LANDON
             What's number one on your list?

She shakes her head.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           58.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
             My number one would be getting out
             of Beaufort.

                           JAMIE
             Getting out won't be your problem.
             It'll be figuring out what you
             want when you get somewhere.

She walks away.

                           LANDON
             What does that mean?!

                           JAMIE
                    (turning back)
             It means you can do anything.

Landon smiles, not sure why she believes in him.


EXT. CARTER HOUSE - CHRISTMAS EVENING

Hanging on the front door:       a simple evergreen wreath with
a plaid bow.


INT. CARTER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

Dark save for a gilded fake tree lit with tiny blinking
lights and the glow of Cynthia's cigarette in the dark.

                          CYNTHIA
             Landon! Come enjoy the tree!
             Landon?!

Landon comes down the stairs. Sits on the sofa.       Wearing
another good shirt. She tries to reach out.

                              CYNTHIA
             You look nice.     I should have
             dressed.

                           LANDON
             You're fine like that, Mom.

                           CYNTHIA
             There's hot cider in the kitchen.

                              LANDON
                       (not moving)
             Thanks.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                          59.

CONTINUED:

                           CYNTHIA
             I haven't seen Clay or Eric
             lately.

                            LANDON
             Me neither.

                           CYNTHIA
             No great loss --

                           LANDON
             I need to go out.

Pause.

                           CYNTHIA
                    (hurt)
             To see your father?

                            LANDON
             No.   I won't be long.

He senses her hurt, but leaves anyway.


INT. PARSONAGE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

A Christmas tree with large colored lights stand in a
corner. Jamie and her father playing cards. The DOORBELL
RINGS. Then urgent BANGING.

                            JAMIE/REV. SULLIVAN
                    (recognizing)
             Landon Carter.


EXT. PARSONAGE - FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

Landon slides his backpack off his shoulder.      Pulls out a
shopping bag. Holds it out to Jamie.

                           LANDON
                    (awkward)
             It's a present. Take it.

She does. She opens the bag, pulls out a beautiful pink
sweater. She's overwhelmed.

Without a word, just a happy smile, Landon hops down the
steps toward his car. Reverend Sullivan appears in the
doorway.

                           LANDON
                    (calling back)
             Merry Christmas! And to all a
             good night!

                                                       60.

INT. PARSONAGE - JAMIE'S ROOM - MINUTES LATER

Jamie hums to herself as she brushes her hair. She's
wearing the new sweater. Her father KNOCKS. Enters.

                         REV. SULLIVAN
           What's Landon Carter up to?

                           JAMIE
                    (innocent)
           Up to?

                         REV. SULLIVAN
           I thought we had rid ourselves of
           his disagreeable companionship.

                         JAMIE
           Dad, why don't you get to the
           point where you get to the point.

                         REV. SULLIVAN
           Why is he giving you a gift?

Jamie doesn't answer.

                         REV. SULLIVAN
           Did you give him a gift?

                            JAMIE
           No.

                         REV. SULLIVAN
           I saw the way he looked at you.
           The way he kissed you.

                            JAMIE
           It was a play.

                         REV. SULLIVAN
                  (unconvinced)
           Boys like him have --
           expectations.

                         JAMIE
           I have expectations, too.

Pause.   He's feeling her grow up, grow away.

                         REV. SULLIVAN
           I'm not changing the rules.

                         JAMIE
           I haven't asked you to.

They eye each other.    He's losing her.

                                                         61.

INT. RETIREMENT HOME - HALLWAY - LATER THAT EVENING

A nurse points Landon toward a patient room.     He carries a
battered liquor-store box.


INT. PATIENT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

A TV flickers. Landon comes in. Opens the box.      Pulls
out the evergreen wreath with the plaid bow.

                       LANDON
          For me. Christmas is all about
          the smells.

Landon leans the wreath in the window. HAROLD KEENE --
the old man from the accident, watches from his bed,
baffled.

                        LANDON
          Pine's my favorite. That and
          cider with cloves.

Landon pulls a Thermos from his coat pocket.     Unscrews the
cap. Finds a drinking cup. Pours in cider.       Offers
Harold the cup.

                           HAROLD
          Who are you?

                           LANDON
          Landon Carter.     I was driving the
          car that --

                           HAROLD
          You.

                           LANDON
          Me.

Harold takes the cup, looks Landon over.    Landon appears
genuinely contrite.

                        LANDON
          I'm very sorry --

                        HAROLD
          What kind of a man are you, son?

Pause.

                        LANDON
                 (honest)
          I don't know that I am -- a man.
          Yet. I'm working on it.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             62.

CONTINUED:

Pause.

                           HAROLD
             I've worked on it my whole life.

Harold reaches under his pillow.         Pulls out a small bottle
of liquor. Tops off his cider.

                           HAROLD
             Get yourself a glass.

                           LANDON
             No. Thanks. Gotta keep my wits
             for the drive home.

Harold nods, liking Landon.

                           HAROLD
             You'll sit a while.

                              LANDON
             I will.


EXT. RURAL ROADS - LATER THAT NIGHT

Landon speeds, the windows open, WIND WHIPPING, DIRE
STRAITS BLASTING. The Camaro turns and brakes and turns
again, kicking up gravel, raising hell. The car slides to
a stop.


INT. CAMARO

Landon turns OFF the RADIO. Sits still. Wipes the
rearview mirror clean, spotless. Unties the dangling
plastic skeleton and pockets it.


EXT. USED CAR LOT - NEXT MORNING

Colorful banners and flags flap in the brisk WIND.        Landon
talks with a used car SALESMAN.

                              SALESMAN
             Eight hundred.

                           LANDON
             It's got a new V-6 and
             transmission. Alloy wheels.
                    (beat)
             Twelve hundred.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                           63.

CONTINUED:

                           SALESMAN
             Nine-fifty.

                           LANDON
             New paint. Extra chrome.     Not a
             scratch anywhere.

                           SALESMAN
             The interior is --

                           LANDON
             Reconditioned. Completely. Be a
             collector's someday. Twelve
             hundred.

They look at the Camaro.    Shining in the sun.

                           SALESMAN
             You can't expect me to pay you for
             your -- attachment to that car.

Landon gazes at another dealership across the street, then
adopts the surly, vaguely-threatening attitude of old.

                          LANDON
             I don't. I expect you to pay me
             for yours.

The Salesman looks from Landon to the car. He pulls a wad
of cash from his pocket. Wearily counts out twelve bills.
Landon takes the money, touches the Camaro's hood, then
walks away.


EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH - FRONT LAWN - NEXT MORNING

The marquee reads, "HAPPY HOLIDAYS!"


EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

One car. An old station wagon.        At the parking space, a
sign: "School Principal Only."


INT. PRINCIPAL KELLY'S OFFICE

Kelly looks up from paperwork.

                           MR. KELLY
             Landon?

Landon drops a folded wad of hundreds on the desk.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                          64.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
             For Jefferson High. For books.

                           MR. KELLY
                    (suspicious)
             Where did you get -- ?

                            LANDON
                    (angry)
             It's mine to give. I didn't steal
             it.

                           MR. KELLY
             I didn't say you did.

But his tone implied it and Landon's already gone. Kelly
is immediately sorry. He goes to his window and sees
Landon pedal away on the old bike.


EXT. CARTER DRIVEWAY - NEXT DAY

Landon watches a tow truck lower the abandoned Yugo. When
the car is down, he sees Jamie standing on the sidewalk.


EXT. FOOT OF DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Landon faces Jamie.

                           LANDON
             Hey.

                           JAMIE
             I heard what you did.   Thank you.

He nods, but quickly changes the subject.

                           LANDON
                    (re: the Yugo)
             She great or what?

                           JAMIE
             Why are you doing all this?   To
             impress me?

                           LANDON
             No.
                    (beat)
             But are you -- impressed?

She smiles.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           65.

CONTINUED:

                             JAMIE
             Like fire.

                             LANDON
             What?

                             JAMIE
             You.

She heads for her father's old Pontiac.

                           LANDON
             New Year's Eve. Would you go out
             with me?!

She stops.    Turns around.    Surprised.

                             JAMIE
             Yes.    But not as a date date.

                             LANDON
             Why not?

                           JAMIE
             I'm not allowed to date.

She smiles and gets in the car.


EXT. SOUTHERN BAPTIST CHURCH - NEXT AFTERNOON

Landon follows signs for the church office.


INT. HALLWAY BY REVEREND SULLIVAN'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Landon looks into the Reverend's office.


LANDON'S POV

Reverend Sullivan is sitting behind his desk, examining
legal-looking documents and records. He takes his glasses
off, rubs his eyes.


BACK TO SCENE

Landon knocks.       The Reverend looks up, furrows his brow.

                           LANDON
             Reverend Sullivan. Can I ask you
             something?

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                           66.

CONTINUED:

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             Does it have to do with Jamie?

                           LANDON
             Yes, sir.

The Reverend makes a small motion and Landon enters.


INT. REVEREND'S OFFICE

Landon doesn't sit.

                           LANDON
             I'd like to take Jamie to dinner
             on New Year's Eve.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             That won't be possible.

He looks back to his papers.    End of conversation.

                           LANDON
             I'm sorry I haven't always treated
             Jamie the way -- I should have.
             She deserves better.

Reverend Sullivan glances up.       As if surprised Landon is
still there.

                           LANDON
             I care for her.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             I don't want to see her hurt.

                           LANDON
             I wouldn't do that --

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             This week.

                           LANDON
             Ever again.

The Reverend looks out the window. A gray day, cold,
bitter, stark. He considers his options.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             Have her home by one. And drive
             carefully.

                                                           67.

EXT./INT. YUGO (CARTER DRIVEWAY) - FEW DAYS LATER

Landon's under the Yugo's hood.     Josh, the kid from next
door, is in the driver's seat.

                        LANDON
          Start the engine.

Josh turns the key. Nothing happens.     Under the hood,
Landon changes something.

                           LANDON
          Again.

Josh tries the engine again.    Still no go.   Landon changes
something else.

                           LANDON
          One more time.

Josh tries one more time. The ENGINE ROARS, then DIES,
then amazingly STARTS again. It's running. Landon high-
fives Josh, then sees an old station wagon turn in.


EXT./INT. STATION WAGON - MOMENTS LATER

Kelly hands a paper to Landon.

                        MR. KELLY
          Your grades for fall semester.
          They're -- good.

                        LANDON
                 (incredulous)
          You came here to give me my report
          card?

                        MR. KELLY
          I've seen students with records
          like yours go to J.C. for a couple
          of years, then transfer to a good
          college.

Landon understands what Kelly is implying.

                        MR. KELLY
          I'd gladly write you a letter of
          recommendation.

                           LANDON
          Thank you.

                        MR. KELLY
          You're welcome.

They shake hands.

                                                      68.

INT. LANDON'S BATHROOM - NEW YEAR'S EVE

Landon, dressed with care, faces the mirror and wet combs
his hair.


INT. FLAUVIN'S - HOUR LATER

A seafood joint on the waterfront. Quaint, not fancy.
Twinkle lights illuminate Jamie's face. Landon finds her
lovely. Jamie picks.

                        JAMIE
          I can't believe you asked my
          father's permission.

                        LANDON
          I wanted this to be a date.

She watches Landon, happy, then perplexed.


JAMIE'S POV

Landon wolfing down his food.


BACK TO SCENE

                        JAMIE
          Is there a rush?

                        LANDON
          I have to get you home by one.

                        JAMIE
          It's only 7:30.

                        LANDON
          We're going somewhere. After.
          And no. I didn't ask your father.


INT. YUGO - TRAVELING - NIGHT

Landon drives. The CARS' "Tonight She Comes" PLAYS.   He
belches loudly, dramatically.

                        JAMIE
          Excuse you.

                        LANDON
          Your turn.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                          69.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
                    (laughing)
             No.

                           LANDON
             I know you want to.

She grins.    And tries.   A small burp.

                           LANDON
             Bring the air all the way up from
             your stomach.

He belches again.    Just as loud.   She tries again,
laughing.


EXT. YUGO

Landon steers the car into a parking lot for a miniature
golf course with a castle-shaped video arcade and Little
League diamond. A family entertainment center.


INT. YUGO

Jamie sees where they are.

                           LANDON
             Before we do this.

                           JAMIE
             We're doing something -- ?

                           LANDON
             Before we do this, I just want to
             say that a good life's gotta be
             about more than achieving stuff --
             like on your list.

She waits for more.

                            LANDON
             It's about working with what you
             already have -- right now -- at
             your fingertips -- you know,
             spontaneously.

                           JAMIE
             What are you talking about?

                           LANDON
             That little bit of larceny in your
             heart.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                          70.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
             Excuse me?

                           LANDON
             Fun.


INT. BATTING CAGE - NIGHT

Jamie's in the cage with a helmet on.    A machine tosses
balls. Landon coaches from outside.

                           LANDON
             Swing! Keep your bat parallel to
             the ground. Follow through.
             Follow through!

Jamie is laughing too hard to hit anything. The balls
keep coming. She ducks out of the way and grasps the
fence and leans in. Landon leans in on his side. They'd
be embracing if the fence weren't there.

In the b.g., kids from their school.    Giggling,
whispering.

Landon looks over at them.

                           LANDON
                    (to Jamie)
             Let's go.


EXT. HIGHWAY - TRAVELING - NIGHT

The YUGO ROARS down the asphalt.    A sign for the
approaching state line whips by.


INT. YUGO - TRAVELING - NIGHT

Jamie and Landon.    With STEVIE NICKS' "Talk to Me" ON the
RADIO.

                           LANDON
             The cells in our bodies are always
             changing. In six or seven years
             all your cells have changed. You
             could be like a completely new
             person from the inside out.

                           JAMIE
             That what's happening to you, only
             faster?

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           71.

CONTINUED:

He grins.    Pulls the car over.

                            LANDON
             Get out.   Come on.

He leaps out, leaving the headlights on.


EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

Landon takes Jamie's hand and pulls her toward some
invisible place.

                           JAMIE
             Where -- what -- are we -- ?

He keeps tugging her.     She follows him.   Laughing.

                           LANDON
             Stand right here.

                            JAMIE
             Where?

He leans down and lifts one of her feet a foot from the
other. He notices a large bruise on her leg. She brushes
her dress down.

                           JAMIE
             You're acting like a crazy person.

                           LANDON
             You're straddling the state line.
             You're in two places at once.

She's thrilled at his solution to her wish.       He walks to
the shoulder of the road.

                           LANDON
             Repeat after me.

Huh?   He does a cartwheel.    She laughs.

                            JAMIE
             I can't.

                           LANDON
             I'm gonna teach you.


EXT. BEACH (NEUSE RIVER) - LATE NIGHT

A starry night with a bright moon. Glimmering silver
water. Jamie and Landon walk onto a dock. DISTANT
FIREWORKS BOOM.
                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                            72.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
             It's places like this that make me
             certain there's a God.

                           LANDON
                    (surprised)
             You're sometimes not sure?

                             JAMIE
             I'm sure.    Pretty sure.

They reach the end of the dock. She turns to face the
WIND. It blows her hair. She turns his face the same
way.

                           JAMIE
             It's like the wind. I can't see
             it but I feel it.

He closes his eyes.       Feeling the wind.   Opens them again,
rejecting the idea.

                           LANDON
             We can measure wind.

                            JAMIE
             Uncertainty makes you
             uncomfortable.

                           LANDON
             What do you actually know with
             religion?

                              JAMIE
             Wonder.     Beauty. Joy.
                       (beat, quieter)
             Love.

She's embarrassed.       She tries to avoid implying anything.

                           JAMIE
             My mother told me God is love, so
             when you're feeling love, you're
             feeling God.
                    (beat)
             I think talking about these things
             -- threatens their very beauty and
             mystery.

Her tone is matter-of-fact, but Landon's got a serious and
tender look on his face. He touches her hair.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                         73.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
                    (almost a whisper)
             I don't understand...

                           LANDON
             Maybe you're not supposed to.

He moves closer.

                           LANDON
             I might kiss you.

She looks down.    Shy.

                           JAMIE
             I might do it wrong.

                           LANDON
                    (tenderly)
             Not possible.

He touches her neck, her cheek, her mouth. Then leans in
and kisses her. A tender, soft kiss. He pulls away.
They look at each other a moment.

                           LANDON
             I love you, Jamie.

There, he put it out there, risked looking and feeling
foolish. Not the old Landon. Jamie looks away. Mixed
emotions. Happy and sad.

                           LANDON
                    (gently)
             Now's when you say something.

                           JAMIE
                    (overwhelmed)
             I can't.
                    (beat)
             I can't -- explain.

She turns back to him, her eyes shining.     She touches his
face and they kiss again, deeply.

But after a few moments, she drops her chin onto his
shoulder. Smiling, glowing even, but slightly aloof,
staring at the water. He pulls away slightly to study her
face. He touches her cheek and brings her back from
wherever she's been.

                           JAMIE
             You make me feel...

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             74.

CONTINUED:

                             LANDON
                      (hopeful)
             Loved?

                             JAMIE
                      (smiling)
             That.    And less strange.

Tears run down her cheeks. Landon wipes them away with
his thumbs, attributing them to happiness.


EXT. PARSONAGE - FRONT PORCH - LATER

Landon follows Jamie up the steps. The lights in the
living room are on. THROUGH the windows, they can see her
father taking down the Christmas tree.

                              JAMIE
             Be very quiet.

He pulls her to him.      Kisses her.     The front door opens.

                            REV. SULLIVAN
                    (embarrassed)
             Hello, Landon.

Landon and Jamie separate, but Landon keeps an arm over
her shoulder.

                              LANDON
             Hey, Reverend.

Reverend Sullivan studies the two young people.

                           LANDON
                    (whispers to Jamie)
             Happy New Year.

And he goes. Jamie walks by her father and into the
house. Not saying anything. He watches her. What has he
allowed?


EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH - COURTYARD - DAY

Landon and Jamie head into school.        Landon nods to
Belinda, others. They glare back.

                           LANDON
                    (to Belinda and
                     others)
             What's your damage?

                                                        75.

INT. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

Landon and Jamie arrive at his locker.    It's been kicked
in.

                           LANDON
          Assholes.     This happen to you?

                           JAMIE
          Twice a year.

Bang, bang, bang. Landon kicks in every locker in his
row. A dozen in all. Jamie watches, a little frightened
by his anger. But then he turns to her and grins.

                        LANDON
          Now they all match.


INT. CAFETERIA - NOON

Landon eats alone, ignored by Eric and Clay. Jamie
approaches with her tray, red-faced, tearful.

She hesitates about sitting -- feeling bad that Landon's
being diminished, ostracized. She thinks he doesn't see
her. But as she turns to leave, he pulls a chair out for
her and smiles. She sits. Landon sees her face.

                           LANDON
          What's wr--?

                        JAMIE
                 (choked up)
          The Challenger exploded.
          Principal Kelly's about to make an
          announcement.

The PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM CRACKLES.    Landon takes Jamie's
hand as the room hushes.

                           LANDON
          Come on.

                           JAMIE
          Where?

                        LANDON
          Away from here.


EXT. FIRE TOWER (CONSERVATION LAND) - STAIRS - HOUR LATER

Landon leads Jamie up, round and round, to the top of the
tall steel tower.

                                                            76.

EXT. TOP OF TOWER - VIEWING AREA

They exit the staircase to a small 360 degree overlook.
Jamie's amazed at the view.

                        JAMIE
          How do you know this place?

                        LANDON
          Before the divorce. My father
          used to take me here. Fire
          spotting was his summer job.

They look off to the curve of the horizon, where sea meets
sky.

                         LANDON
          From here he proved to me the
          earth isn't flat.
                  (beat)
          On rainy days, we'd be above the
          clouds.

                        JAMIE
          What would you do up here?

                          LANDON
          Look.   Talk.   Not talk.

He pulls a deck of cards from his jacket pocket. They sit
and he starts to shuffle. Not too well. Jamie takes the
deck. Shuffles like a card shark.


EXT. CEMETERY - REAR GATE - NIGHT (FEW DAYS LATER)

Jamie is already waiting when Landon's Yugo pulls up.       He
gets out, walks to her, they kiss.

                        LANDON
          What'd you tell your father?

                         JAMIE
          The truth.   I just left you out of
          it.

She climbs up and over the wall.      He follows.


EXT. INSIDE CEMETERY - MINUTES LATER

Jamie fits the pieces of her telescope together.

                        LANDON
          When did you build this?

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                            77.

CONTINUED:

                              JAMIE
             I was twelve.

Landon shakes his head, amazed.

                           JAMIE
             It's not that complicated.

Landon doubts this.

                           JAMIE
             It's an alt-azimuth design with
             one parabolic mirror and one
             secondary flat one.

                           LANDON
             Where's the one you're building?

                           JAMIE
             In my back yard.
                    (pause, embarrassed)
             I lied before. It's hardly
             started. But when it's done, it
             will have twice the power of this
             one --

                              LANDON
             Wait, back up.     You lied?

                              JAMIE
             Kinda.   Yeah.

He grins, loving her even more.

                           JAMIE
             So what do you want to see?

                              LANDON
             Mars.

                           JAMIE
             Mars doesn't rise until 2:30
             A.M. --

He opens his backpack.        Pulls out the contents.

                           LANDON
             A Thermos of hot coffee.       A
             blanket. Socks.

                           JAMIE
             You planned this --

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                             78.

CONTINUED:

                             LANDON
             Hoped for it.

Pause.

                           JAMIE
             Are you trying to seduce me?

                             LANDON
             No.   Why?   Are you seducible?

                            JAMIE
                     (firm, but smiling)
             No.

                           LANDON
             That's what I thought.

He reaches back into his backpack.      Pulls out a second
blanket.

                           LANDON
             Ergo, a second blanket.   One for
             me, one for you.

He hands her one.     She takes it, smiling, reassured.

                             JAMIE
             Ergo?

                           LANDON
                    (slightly embarrassed)
             What about your father?

                           JAMIE
             I'm always home by midnight and
             he's always asleep.


INT. PARSONAGE - REVEREND SULLIVAN'S BEDROOM - MIDNIGHT

Reverend Sullivan sits up in bed.      His feet find slippers
on the floor.


INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Reverend Sullivan, wearing a robe, enters quietly.
Checking on his daughter. Her bed is empty.


EXT. STREET TO ACCESS ROAD - LATER

The old Pontiac slows.

                                                      79.

INT. OLD PONTIAC

Reverend Sullivan looks down the access road to the rear
cemetery gate.


REVEREND'S POV

The Yugo parked by the gate.


BACK TO SCENE

The Reverend struggles with what to do. After a moment,
he decides not to interfere; he'll pick his moment. He
keeps driving.


INT. CEMETERY

Jamie and Landon are looking at the heavens through the
telescope.

                           LANDON
          Where's Pluto?

                        JAMIE
          In Virgo, but it's about 1000
          times too faint to see.

                        LANDON
          What's the best thing I can see
          tonight?

                           JAMIE
          Me.

He draws her close, they kiss. She shyly pulls away.
Their hands still touching until she looks again into the
telescope eyepiece.

                        JAMIE
          The second best thing is Jupiter.

She swivels the telescope into position for Jupiter and
steps aside so he can look. But he picks up the
flashlight, pulls a diagram from his pocket.

                        LANDON
          Can you locate XXI5639I?

                           JAMIE
          Sure.

She takes the diagram, studies it, and adjusts the scope.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                              80.

CONTINUED:

                            JAMIE
             Here.   Why am I looking at this
             star?

                            LANDON
             Because I had it named for you.     I
             know it's not an official
             designation --

She couldn't be happier.     She reaches for his hand.

                           JAMIE
             It's wonderful. I love you.

It's the first time he's heard it. He pulls her into his
arms. They kiss. Passionately. She starts to object.

                            LANDON
                     (respecting her
                      boundaries)
             Okay.   I'm stopping.

And he does.    They snuggle.   Silence, then:

                           LANDON
             What's number one?

Long pause.

                           JAMIE
                    (very shy)
             In April when the dogwoods and
             wisteria are blooming... Get
             married.

He doesn't make fun.     He strokes her hair.    Kisses her
forehead.


INT. KITCHEN - 5 AM

Landon enters from outside. Cynthia, still in her
waitress uniform, is sitting at the table, drinking
coffee.

                           CYNTHIA
             A late night or an early morning?

                           LANDON
                    (honest)
             Late night.
                    (smart-aleck)
             You?

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                           81.

CONTINUED:

                           CYNTHIA
             Were you with Jamie?

                           LANDON
             Yeah.

                           CYNTHIA
             You sleeping with her?

Landon doesn't dignify this question with an answer.

                           CYNTHIA
             I was cleaning yesterday.   I found
             this.

She pulls Landon's Life List from her pocket.      Landon is
horrified. She reads it.

                            CYNTHIA
             Scuba dive. Touch a moon rock.
             Learn to read Egyptian
             hieroglyphs. Go to college?
                    (pause)
             She talking to you 'bout this
             stuff?

Landon doesn't answer. She puts the list on the table.
Smoothes it. Gently discouraging.

                           CYNTHIA
             Honey, some of this is...
             farfetched. You take after me.
             People skills and common sense.
             Good dependable qualities.

                           LANDON
             I could take after Dad, too.

                          CYNTHIA
             You do. You're handsome and
             charming.

                           LANDON
             I meant he's a doctor.

                           CYNTHIA
             That's eight years of school and
             training -- after college. And
             all that doesn't necessarily make
             you a better human being.

                           LANDON
             I could do it if I tried.   Even
             Kelly thinks so.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                          82.

CONTINUED:

                           CYNTHIA
             That'd be something.

She doesn't want to discourage him, but she wants him to
be practical and realistic.

                           CYNTHIA
             But if it doesn't happen, grab for
             something within reach. Life's
             tough enough without causing
             yourself disappointment --

                           LANDON
                    (angry now)
             Whatever my life is, I'm going to
             be friggin' sure I'm never
             disappointed --

                           CYNTHIA
                    (honest)
             Disappointment isn't something
             anyone plans for.
                    (quieter)
             It catches you by surprise.

Long pause.    They are both sorry to have raised their
voices.

                           CYNTHIA
             Have I told you how proud I am of
             you -- ?

                           LANDON
             Mom, great. But what I want is
             for me to be proud of me.


INT. PARSONAGE - SULLIVAN DINING ROOM - EVENING

Landon eats dinner with Jamie and Reverend Sullivan.
Silence, then:

                            REV. SULLIVAN
             Landon.   You're not the quiet
             type.

                            LANDON
             No.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             So talk to us about something.

                           LANDON
             Like what, sir?

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           83.

CONTINUED:

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             You decide.

Landon searches his mind for just the right subject.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             How about your family?

                            LANDON
             Okay.  Sure.
                    (beat)
             My grandfather. When he was
             seven, he shook the hand of an old
             guy, a war vet or something, who
             had once shaken President
             Lincoln's hand.
                    (pause)
             Made a big impression on him.

Reverend Sullivan looks at his daughter.       She's nodding,
interested.

                           LANDON
             My cousin Mike. He's from a big
             family. He's the fifth kid. He
             heard that every fifth child in
             the world is Chinese. So he
             thought he was.

Jamie smiles.

                           LANDON
             We didn't tell him any different
             for years --

                            REV. SULLIVAN
                    (getting to the
                     point)
             Your parents are divorced?

                           LANDON
             Since I was five. My mom's a
             cocktail waitress.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             How do you -- the two of you --
             get by?

                           LANDON
             Materially or spiritually?

                           REV. SULLIVAN
                    (surprised)
             Either. Both.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                           84.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
                    (honest)
             I don't know. We used to try to
             believe in each other.

His eyes meet the Reverend's.      The Reverend's got to
respect him some.


INT. SULLIVAN KITCHEN - NIGHT

Reverend Sullivan looks out the window into the back yard.


HIS POV

Jamie showing Landon the junk pile that will become her
newer, larger telescope. They are laughing, jostling each
other, comfortable, happy.


INT. PARSONAGE - SULLIVAN KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT

Reverend Sullivan and Jamie put the dishes away.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             You and the Carter boy. Want to
             catch me up on recent
             developments?

                           JAMIE
             You're asking if we're involved?

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             I'm asking how much.

                           JAMIE
             Dad --

                            REV. SULLIVAN
             It's time to tell him.
                    (pause)
             It would be the right thing.

She turns to him, upset.    Her anger spilling out.

                           JAMIE
             Maybe. But that's not the real
             reason. You think if I tell,
             he'll disappear and that's what
             you want! Me all to yourself!

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           85.

CONTINUED:

                            REV. SULLIVAN
                     (calm, stung)
             No.   I want what's best for you.

                           JAMIE
             This -- him -- Landon -- is what's
             best for me!

                             REV. SULLIVAN
             You're sure?    You're sure you can
             trust him?

He's playing to her old insecurities.      She's not one
hundred percent sure.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
                    (gentler)
             Isn't it better to know?

Their eyes meet.     She knows he's right.


EXT. MOVIE THEATER - EVENING (EARLY FEBRUARY)

Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Three Amigos! on the marquee.

Landon and Jamie exit as Belinda and a new boyfriend buy
tickets. Clay and Eric and a crowd behind them.

                             LANDON
             Hey, Belinda.

She takes her boyfriend's arm, turns away, snubbing him.

                             LANDON
             Clay, Eric.

Eric says something inaudible and the whole crowd sniggers
and laughs. He's become Landon. Landon reddens, now
realizing for certain that he's become a Jamie Sullivan.


EXT. SIDEWALK (DOWNTOWN BEAUFORT) - MOMENTS LATER

Landon and Jamie walk.       The theater in the b.g.

                           JAMIE
                    (re: his status)
             From citizen high to citizen low.

                             LANDON
             I don't care.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                            86.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
             Care, but just don't let it get to
             you. It gives them power.

                           LANDON
             That what you do?

                            JAMIE
             Yes.   I try to keep my power.

He's impressed with how she manages.

                           LANDON
             One of your secrets.

                           JAMIE
                    (serious)
             Yes, one of many.

He doesn't notice her tone.


INT. YUGO - TRAVELING - NIGHT

WHITNEY HOUSTON's "How Will I Know?" ON the RADIO. Jamie
flips the RADIO OFF. She's got something on her mind.
Landon notices only that she seems a bit remote.

                           LANDON
             You're worried about your college
             applications.

                           JAMIE
             I'm not applying to college.

                           LANDON
                    (stunned)
             But you said --

                           JAMIE
             No, you assumed.

He looks at her, questioning.       She's looking out her
window.

                           LANDON
             You're going to take a year off?
             Join the Peace Corps -- ?

                            JAMIE
             No.

                           LANDON
             What are you going to -- ?

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                              87.

CONTINUED:

                              JAMIE
             Pull over.

                              LANDON
             Where?   Why?

                            JAMIE
             Pull over.   Now. Please.

Tears are running down her face.        He pulls the car over.


EXT. WOODS BY SIDE OF ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

Jamie gets out of the car.       Landon quickly follows.

                              LANDON
             Jamie --

                              JAMIE
             I'm sick.

                           LANDON
             Then I'll take you home.      You'll
             feel better tomorrow.

He tries to take her arm. She shakes off his hand, steps
back. Wanting to be heard and understood.

                          JAMIE
             Landon. I'm sick -- with
             leukemia.

Landon tries to say something.         Nothing comes out.   His
soul numb.

                           JAMIE
             I found out last winter. I'm not
             responding to treatment anymore.

His face crumples with pain and anguish.

                           LANDON
             Why didn't you tell me?

                            JAMIE
             The doctors said to do everything
             the same as long as possible.
                    (pause)
             I didn't want anyone being --
             weird around me.

                              LANDON
             Including me?!

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                            88.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
             Especially you.
                    (long beat)
             God gives me an illness, then you.
             A cruel joke.

She gets in the car. Slams her door shut.       He stands
there, not knowing what to do.


EXT. YUGO - TRAVELING - LATER

Landon pulls up in front of Jamie's house.      A long quiet
ride.

                           LANDON
             I'm not letting you die.

Jamie just looks at him.    Feeling sorry for him -- what he
wants doesn't matter.


INT. SULLIVAN KITCHEN - LATE NIGHT

The Reverend and Landon drink coffee.

                            REV. SULLIVAN
             It's her decision and she's
             decided not to tell people -- at
             least for now.

                           LANDON
             How -- how long does she have?

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             Two, three months. Maybe less.
             Maybe more.

                           LANDON
             So you've given up.

Reverend Sullivan hears the challenge in his voice.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             Her doctors have. Jamie and I.
             We're still praying for a miracle.

                           LANDON
                    (disdainful)
             Praying.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             Landon. We've lived with this for
             over a year now and --

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                      89.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
             If there is a God, how could he
             let this happen??!!

It's a long answer and by the time the Reverend opens his
mouth to explain, Landon's out the door.


EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Moonless dark. Few cars. The YUGO RIPS down the road.
Landon opens a map over the steering wheel. Turns on the
dome light. Looks at the return address on an old letter.


EXT. CITY STREETS (RALEIGH) - 3 A.M.

Landon's Yugo winds through city streets.


EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD (RALEIGH) - MINUTES LATER

Mansions. Big lawns. The Yugo slows as Landon leans
forward to read a street sign. His face is tear-streaked.
He flicks his headlights to bright, then low again.

The car turns left.


EXT. DR. CARTER'S HOME - MINUTE LATER

Large new colonial. Landon slams his car door and stands
in the street. Staring at his father's house. He heads
up a flagstone path for the front door.


EXT. FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

Landon RINGS the resounding DING-DONG BELL, then bangs on
the heavy wood door. Grief-stricken.

                           LANDON
             Dr. Carter!... Carter!... Dad!
             Please!! I have to talk to you!!


INT. DR. CARTER'S HOME

Elegant, thick carpets. Dr. Carter, putting on his robe,
parts the silk drapes in the upstairs hall.

                                                         90.

DR. CARTER'S POV

His son standing on the front lawn.     Distraught, tearful.

                           LANDON
          Open the door!     Please!!


EXT. DR. CARTER'S HOME

Landon backs away from the house. Angrily kicks over a
decorative planter. Is halfway to his car when Dr. Carter
opens the door and comes out.

                           DR. CARTER
          Landon!

Landon doesn't hear.

                           DR. CARTER
          Landon!!

Landon turns around. Sees his father. Breaks down,
sobbing. His father goes to him. Hugs him, a big bear
hug.

                        LANDON
          You have to save her!

                         DR. CARTER
          Landon, who?   Is your mother all
          right?

Lights pop upstairs.

                        LANDON
          It's Jamie -- my girlfriend -- she
          has cancer -- you have to come
          look at her -- right now!

                        DR. CARTER
                 (calm, trying to
                  diffuse)
          It's the middle of the night --

                        LANDON
          I don't give a shit what time it
          is!

Landon pulls away.   Angrier.

                        DR. CARTER
          Landon, I'm a cardiologist, not an
          oncologist --

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             91.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
             You're a doctor, aren't you?!!

He waves his father off, dismissing him.

                            DR. CARTER
             Landon!   I'll look into it!!

But Landon hasn't heard. He's in his car. Dr. Carter
watches his son's car move away, regretful.


INT. CARTER KITCHEN - DAWN

Landon quietly shuts the back door.        Exhausted.   Starts
making coffee. Cynthia appears.

                           CYNTHIA
             Your father called.

No response.

                           CYNTHIA
             Jamie's a patient at his hospital.
             He's having a colleague look at
             her chart this morning.

Long pause.

                            CYNTHIA
             I'm sorry.   I didn't know.

                           LANDON
             I didn't know either.


EXT. PARSONAGE - EARLY MORNING

The Yugo parked in the driveway. The morning paper lying
on the grass. Landon paces in front of the front porch.
Incapable of ringing the bell, lacking the courage,
lacking the right words.

Upstairs, the curtains move.


INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM

Jamie looks out the window.


JAMIE'S POV

Landon pacing, talking to himself.

                                                        92.

BACK TO SCENE

She starts to raise the window, to say something, to help
him, but then lets the curtain drop. She needs for him to
decide, for him to be ready to face this with her.

The sound of a CAR.   She looks out the window again.


JAMIE'S POV

The Yugo driving away.


INT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT DAY

Landon lies on his bed in the dark. The PHONE RINGS.
Landon stares at his extension. The RINGING STOPS. A
voice from downstairs.

                        CYNTHIA (O.S.)
          It's your father.

Landon picks up his phone.


INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - TWO MINUTES LATER

The door to Landon's room is ajar. Cynthia waits outside.
Listening. Hearing nothing. She pushes the door open.


CYNTHIA'S POV

Landon sitting on his bed.   Deflated.

                        LANDON
          He can't do anything.


BACK TO SCENE

Cynthia is pained to see his suffering.

                        CYNTHIA
          If it's incurable --

                        LANDON
          I told him to leave me alone.

                         CYNTHIA
          Landon --

                        LANDON
                 (re: Jamie)
          It was the only thing I've ever
          asked him!

                                                        93.

INT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - EVENING (NEXT DAY)

Landon's still in bed. Facing the wall.     Cynthia KNOCKS.
Enters with a plate of food.

                        CYNTHIA
          I brought some dinner.

No response.   She leaves the tray and goes.


INT. PARSONAGE - SULLIVAN KITCHEN - SAME TIME

Jamie and her father eat dinner.   Jamie is red-eyed,
heartbroken.

                        JAMIE
                 (not sure at all)
          He'll call.

                        REV. SULLIVAN
          I wanted to think he'd changed.

                          JAMIE
                  (angry)
          No you didn't.
                  (beat)
          But he did change. Just not
          enough.

                        REV. SULLIVAN
          Jamie, you're not mad at me.
          You're mad at Landon --

                        JAMIE
                 (furious)
          I am mad at you! And at Landon!
          And the universe! And God!
                 (quieter)
          I don't even know where to put all
          my anger.

                        REV. SULLIVAN
          That's normal. God accepts your
          anger. He won't punish you.

                        JAMIE
          By making me ill, he is punishing
          me!
                 (quieter)
          I just don't know what for.

She flees the room.

                                                         94.

ANOTHER ANGLE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Goes up the stairs.    Keeps going.   Up another flight to
the attic.


INT. PARSONAGE ATTIC - MINUTE LATER

Jamie opens a closet door. Pulls out a dress, a scarf,
jewelry, a worn book -- her mother's belongings. She
opens the book and starts to weep. Missing her mother.


FOOT OF ATTIC STAIRS

Reverend Sullivan stands, looking up at the attic stairs.
Frustrated, angry, worried.


INT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - NEXT DAY

Landon is still in bed. Cynthia enters.      Pulls back the
curtains. Yanks up the shades.

                         CYNTHIA
           I don't care if you don't leave
           the house. But you have to get
           out of bed.


INT. CARTER KITCHEN - FEW MINUTES LATER

Landon sits at the kitchen table.     Cynthia pours him a cup
of coffee.

                         CYNTHIA
           You and I may not be communicating
           very well right now. But let me
           be clear. Don't make this about
           you. It's about her.

Pause.   Her words sink in.

                         LANDON
           I have no idea what to say. How
           to act. What if I do the wrong
           thing?

                         CYNTHIA
                  (gently)
           Be yourself and I don't think
           there is a wrong thing.
                  (beat)
           Let Jamie take the lead. She'll
           let you know what she needs.

                                                         95.

EXT. PARSONAGE - FRONT PORCH - LITTLE LATER

Before Landon can ring the bell, the front door opens.
The Reverend. Landon runs past him into the house.

                        LANDON
          Where's Jamie?!

                          REV. SULLIVAN
          At school.    Where you should be.

Oh.


INT. BEAUFORT HIGH - CORRIDOR - HALF HOUR LATER

Deserted, classes are meeting. Landon runs, sliding to a
stop at one classroom door. Looks in, keeps going, stops
at another. Searching.


This is JAMIE'S POV from the top of the hallway.


JAMIE

She stands, holding her books, watching him, unsure.


LANDON

finally feels her gaze, turns to look.


JAMIE

turns away, still angry and disappointed.


LANDON

runs to her.

                          LANDON
          Jamie!

He catches up to her.


JAMIE AND LANDON

face each other.   Neither sure what to say.

                          LANDON
          I'm so sorry.    I'm a coward --

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                      96.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
             I should have told you sooner --

                           LANDON
                    (guilt-ridden)
             I made you do too many things,
             kept you up all night --

                           JAMIE
             No. The drugs just stopped
             working. If anything, doing
             things I love kept me healthy
             longer.

Pause.

                           LANDON
             Are you frightened?

                           JAMIE
             All the time.
                    (beat)
             I feel like I have no one.

She means not even God and he gets this.

                            LANDON
             You have me.

He hugs her close, rocking her, comforting her and
himself.

                           JAMIE
             Help me live until I die?

                            LANDON
             I will.


INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - EVENING (MID-FEBRUARY)

A small group of students sit on stage reading from Our
Town, rehearsing. Jamie and Landon sit together in the
third row, holding hands. Landon glances at her, realizes
she's asleep. Pulls her sweater over her.


INT. JEFFERSON HIGH - LIBRARY - SATURDAY MORNING

Landon sits with Luis; Jamie at the next table with
Isabel. She looks pale. He catches her eye. They both
smile, a little sadly, then turn back to their students.

                                                           97.

INT. YUGO - TRAVELING

Landon drives them home from Jefferson High.      No music.

                          LANDON
            They're going to build a tunnel
            under the English Channel.
            They're calling it The Chunnel.

No response.

                           LANDON
            You hungry?

                           JAMIE
            Nope.

                          LANDON
            Anything you want.

                           JAMIE
            Nothing.

He reaches into a cooler on the floor of the back seat.

                         LANDON
            Slim Jim? Apple? Yogurt?     You
            like yogurt.

                          JAMIE
            I used to like yogurt.

He places a red heart-shaped box in her lap.

                          LANDON
                   (apologetic)
            Not very original. Happy
            Valentine's Day.

He grins.   She looks crestfallen, feels terrible.

                          JAMIE
            I didn't even think about it.

He takes a chocolate.     Pops it in his mouth.   Grins.

                           LANDON
            There.   You gave me a chocolate.


LANDON'S POV (THROUGH JAMIE'S TELESCOPE) - VAST STAR
FIELD

PULL BACK to reveal...

                                                           98.

EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

Jamie and Landon are looking at stars.      A long quiet
moment.

                          LANDON
            What are you thinking?

                          JAMIE
                   (honest)
            That I want you to take me home.

                            LANDON
            Now?    We just --

                          JAMIE
            I don't want to come here anymore.

She begins taking the telescope apart.      Depressed.


EXT. CEMETERY GATE - HALF HOUR LATER

Jamie looks at the high fence, weary, then reaches into a
pocket for a key. Unlocks the gate. Swings the gate
open. Landon's astonished.

                          LANDON
            You have a key?

                           JAMIE
            Yeah.  I've just never needed it.
                   (pause)
            Will you talk to my father?

                          LANDON
            I've talked to your father.

                          JAMIE
            That's what I mean.

Their eyes meet.     Her look is serious.


EXT. PARSONAGE - BACK YARD - NEXT DAY

Reverend Sullivan is up a ladder. Cleaning a gutter.
Landon stands below, a few feet away, gathering his nerve.
He walks over.


ON LADDER

The Reverend is busy ignoring Landon standing below.       A
long beat, then:

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           99.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
                    (calling up)
             Sir. Being ignored is beginning
             to feel preferable to being
             noticed.

The Reverend looks down.

                            LANDON
             I'll be honest. I don't know if I
             can pray, but I can do just about
             anything else.

Neither Landon nor the Reverend see Jamie come out of the
house and walk over.


ON GROUND

Landon shields his eyes with a hand to see the Reverend
better.

                           LANDON
             Whatever you need. Whatever Jamie
             needs. I'm here.
                    (beat)
             I could start by driving her to
             school --

                           JAMIE
             I'm not going back to school.

Landon and her father both turn to her.      Pale, wane.   They
understand what she is saying.

                           JAMIE
             You can tell anyone you want.   I
             don't care.

She goes into the house. Landon and Reverend Sullivan
look at each other, then away, uncomfortable. That didn't
sound like her.


INT. BEAUFORT HIGH - HALLWAY - MONDAY MORNING

Landon, looking haggard, moves slowly as he cleans out
Jamie's locker.

Students stare as he carefully places her things,
including the pink sweater, in a shopping bag. They part
and hush as he passes by. News travels fast. Clay and
Eric step forward.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                            100.

CONTINUED:

                              CLAY
             Hey.   Landon.

                           ERIC
             We heard 'bout Jamie Sullivan.
             She --

                           LANDON
                    (fierce)
             Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.

                             ERIC
                      (misunderstood,
                       genuine)
             No.    Hey. We're sorry, man!

Landon turns back. Surprised.        Inspects Belinda.   Eric.
Clay. Others. No one speaks.

                           LANDON
             Too late and not enough.

He pushes past Belinda's new boyfriend, heading for the
office.


INT. PRINCIPAL KELLY'S OFFICE - DAY

Mr. Kelly and Landon.

                           LANDON
             I know it means not graduating,
             but I need to be excused from all
             school acti--

                           MR. KELLY
             You're excused.

Landon heads for the door.

                              MR. KELLY
             How is she?

Landon can't answer.       Too emotional.

                           MR. KELLY
             You will graduate.

Landon looks up, astounded.

                           MR. KELLY
             If I have to tutor you myself.

Landon nods, accepting, appreciative.

                                                         101.

INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - LATER

Landon puts away the contents of the shopping bag.
Jamie's in bed, wearing the sweater.

                        JAMIE
          Yesterday I felt sick, horrible.
          Today I feel like riding my bike.
          Or dancing.

He turns on the CLOCK RADIO next to her bed. Finds a
WALTZ. Offers his hand. Pulls her out of bed. She's in
pajamas.

                        JAMIE
          You know how to waltz??

                        LANDON
                 (bashful)
          I was going to fake it.

                        JAMIE
          I always fake it.

So they waltz, faking, stumbling and laughing, holding
each other.


INT. PARSONAGE - STAIRCASE - SAME TIME

Reverend Sullivan hears the MUSIC and LAUGHTER.   He
frowns, afraid for Jamie's health.


INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM

Jamie grips Landon's arms, seems to slip, suddenly too
exhausted to carry her weight. Landon picks her up,
gently carries her back to bed. Settles her in.

                           LANDON
          How you doing?

                          JAMIE
                   (murmurs)
          Tired.

Landon sits on her bed. Strokes her hair. They look at
each other. Landon reaches for her hand. When he looks
at her face again, she's asleep.


EXT. LANDON'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - ANOTHER DAY

Landon's sitting on his childhood tree swing, twisting
side to side. Pensive. His mother comes out of the
house.
                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                           102.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
             Time seems to be slowing down and
             speeding up at the same time.

She reaches to put a hand on his shoulder.       He lets her.


EXT. CEMETERY - EARLY MARCH

The rear gate is open. A caretaker waits while Landon
carries pieces of the older telescope to his car. A tall
pile of parts is already at his car.

Eric and Clay drive up in Eric's pickup.    Gravel flying.
MUSIC BLASTING.


INT. PICKUP

Eric and Clay spy Landon.


EXT. CEMETERY

Landon freezes, not sure what to expect.


EXT. PICKUP

The truck makes a circle around Landon, then stops. The
MUSIC QUIETS. Eric and Clay jump down. A long tense
moment, then:

                           ERIC
             Hey.

                           LANDON
             Hey.

Without a word, Clay walks to the Yugo, lifts the heaviest
telescope part, and carries it to the bed of the pickup.
Eric follows suit.


EXT. PARSONAGE - BACK YARD - LATER

Landon studies the pieces of the smaller telescope and how
they fit together. They are like a map for how to build
the bigger one.


EXT. PARSONAGE DRIVEWAY - NEXT DAY

Landon unloads an impossibly large round cardboard
concrete form-tube from his car. Carries it around the
house toward the back yard.

                                                         103.

INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Jamie wakes from a nap. She looks thinner, grayer. She
hears HAMMERING. She hauls herself up and to a window.


JAMIE'S POV

Landon working on the new telescope.    He looks up at her
window. Sees her there. Smiles.


BACK TO SCENE

Reverend Sullivan comes in to check on Jamie.    She's
standing at the window.

                        REV. SULLIVAN
          What's that boy doing?

She turns to look at him and collapses into his arms.


INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT ROOM - NIGHT

Jamie lies in bed, eyes closed. Hooked to monitors,
pumps, an IV drip. Landon holding her hand. Reverend
Sullivan talks quietly with a doctor. Hearing bad news.


EXT. HOSPITAL - DAWN

The sky is pink. A squirrel runs along a telephone wire.
The Yugo is the only car in the visitor lot.


INT. PATIENT ROOM

Landon, in yesterday's clothes, dozes lightly. Jamie
moves and he starts, fully awake. She opens her eyes.

                        LANDON
          You okay?

She nods. Sleepy. Closes her eyes again. He rests his
head on her shoulder and weeps. Her eyes open, then close
again. There's nothing to say.


INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE JAMIE'S ROOM - SAME TIME

Reverend Sullivan looks through the window in the door at
the scene within. He hesitates, then pushes the door
open.

                                                           104.

INT. PATIENT ROOM

Reverend Sullivan enters.

                         REV. SULLIVAN
          Landon.   You go on home.

                           LANDON
          I'm not tired.

                        REV. SULLIVAN
          I need to be with her.

There's only one chair.    Landon nods and goes.

The Reverend sits, closes his eyes a moment.   When he
opens them, she's looking at him.

                           JAMIE
          Dad.

He kisses her forehead, then sits back.

                           JAMIE
          So serious.

                        REV. SULLIVAN
          Jamie, God is not punishing you.
          No God I know wants anyone to be
          sick or feel pain or suffer.

Pause.

                        JAMIE
          When Mom died you told me God
          wanted her more, loved her more --

                        REV. SULLIVAN
          I was wrong. Nobody could have
          wanted or loved your mother more
          than we did. Not even God.

He lets this sink in.

                        REV. SULLIVAN
          God loaned you to me, entrusted
          you to my care. I'm failing you.

She looks away, agreeing without saying so.

                        REV. SULLIVAN
          Jamie. I make you the same
          promise that God does.
                 (beat)
          I will always be with you.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                          105.

CONTINUED:

She sits up and embraces him. He wraps his arms around
her. Tight. She closes her eyes, tears welling, never
wanting to let him go. Her father.


EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH SCHOOL - HOUR LATER

On the marquee on the front lawn: "WELCOME HALEY'S
COMET." The Yugo parks in the b.g.


INT. PRINCIPAL KELLY'S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

Landon picks up a pile of books and assignments.
Looks through them, then eyes Miss Tarbox.

                           LANDON
             Where's Jamie's book?!

                           MISS TARBOX
             That's everything Mr. Kelly gave
             me.

                           LANDON
                    (insistent)
             The next book on that list!   The
             Old Man and... and...

                            MISS TARBOX
             The Sea.

                            LANDON
             Yeah.   I need it today!

Mr. Kelly steps out of his inner office.      Sees Landon's
anguished face, his exhaustion.

                           MR. KELLY
             I'll drive a copy over to her.

Landon nods his appreciation.


INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT ROOM - DAY

Jamie looks smaller. Her eyes have blue circles beneath.
The Hemingway novel on the bedstand. Belinda pushes the
door open. Peeks in. Not sure she is welcome.

Landon is sitting in a chair.     He sees her, motions for
her to come in. Quietly.

                            BELINDA
             She asleep?

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                              106.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
             I'll tell her you were here.

Pause.   Awkwardness.

                           BELINDA
             Give her this, okay?

She hands Landon a small photo album.

                           BELINDA
             Pictures from the play.   Jamie
             looks pretty --

                           LANDON
             I'm sorry about how we --

                             BELINDA
                      (conciliatory)
             No.    You're with who you should
             be.    It's like she chose you.

                           LANDON
                    (agreeing)
             And I have no idea why.

                             BELINDA
             I do.

She hugs him quickly, then leaves.       Landon goes to the
window, looks out.


SAME SCENE - HOURS LATER

The sky is grayer, darker.      Landon is still at the window.
Jamie wakes.

                             JAMIE
             Hi.

He goes to her side.

                             LANDON
             Hey.

He kisses her.

                           JAMIE
             I have something for you.

She reaches under her pillow for the worn book from the
attic. She offers it to Landon.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                           107.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
                    (smiling)
             Don't worry. It's not a Bible.

He takes it.

                           JAMIE
             My mother made it for me before I
             was born.
                    (beat)
             It's got quotes from famous
             people. Her favorite lines from
             books. Her thoughts.

Landon looks at a page.

                           LANDON
                    (reading)
             'What is a friend? A single soul
             dwelling in two bodies.'
             Aristotle.

                            JAMIE
             Lower.   Same page.

                           LANDON
                    (reading)
             'Find out who you are and do it on
             purpose.' Dolly Parton.

A bookmark falls out.     He studies that page a moment.


CLOSE ON PASSAGE

from Corinthians.


BACK TO SCENE

Landon reads it.

                            LANDON
             'Love is always patient and kind.
             It is never boastful or
             conceited -- '

                           JAMIE
             That was read at my parents'
             wedding.

He takes her hand.     Holds it.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           108.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
             How're you doing?

                           JAMIE
                    (looking away)
             Better. I was really angry.

                              LANDON
             I know.

                              JAMIE
             It's gone now.

                           LANDON
                    (gently)
             Because you have hope that you'll
             get better?

                              JAMIE
             No.
                     (pause, shrugging,
                      accepting)
             Maybe I believe God has a bigger
             dream for me than I had for
             myself.
                     (beat)
             Maybe I believe the journey, the
             big adventure, never ends...

He kneels on the floor.       Puts his head on her pillow next
to hers.

                           JAMIE
             Maybe I believe God sent you to me
             because I am ill. To help me
             through.

He touches her face tenderly.

                           JAMIE
                    (almost whispering)
             I want to go home.

Pause.   He gets her meaning.

                            LANDON
                    (trying not to
                     break)
             I'll talk to your father.

                            JAMIE
                    (looking away)
             It's not that simple.
                    (pause)
             It costs money to do this at home.

                                                       109.

INT. CARTER LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Cynthia pacing, talking on the phone, worried.   The front
door is wide open.

                        CYNTHIA
                 (into phone)
          ... He doesn't talk to me, maybe
          not to anyone, except Jamie...

She stands in the doorway and looks out.


CYNTHIA'S POV

Landon in his car in the driveway.


INT. LANDON'S CAR

Landon just sits.    Exhausted, despondent.


INT. CARTER LIVING ROOM

Cynthia pacing.

                        CYNTHIA
                 (into phone)
          ... I've never asked you for
          extra. But we need it now... as
          soon as possible...


INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT ROOM - ANOTHER AFTERNOON

Jamie's breathing is shallower. Landon's reading her The
Sheltering Sky. He pauses, looks up. Isabel, Jamie's
student, is standing in the doorway. Jamie sees her too.
She smiles weakly.

                            JAMIE
          Isabel?

                            ISABEL
                    (shy)
          Hi.

Isabel comes in. Landon offers her the book. She takes
it and keeps going from where Landon left off. Stumbling
but reading. Jamie grins.

                        JAMIE
          Who's been working with you?

Isabel looks shyly at Landon. Jamie shakes her head,
amazed. Landon nods to Isabel and she begins reading
again.

                                                         110.

EXT. CARTER BACK STEPS - THAT NIGHT

Landon quietly opens the back door to the kitchen.


HIS POV

Cynthia sits at the table with Dr. Carter, his father.

                        CYNTHIA
          Sit with us a minute.


INT. CARTER KITCHEN

Landon enters, but doesn't sit.

                        LANDON
                 (to his father)
          What are you doing here?

                        CYNTHIA
          He wants to talk to you.

                         LANDON
                 (to his mother)
          Now it's okay?

                        CYNTHIA
          Landon. You have two parents.
          We're both here for you even --

                         DR. CARTER
          -- even if we're not here for each
          other anymore.

Landon is listening.

                        DR. CARTER
          I want to do this. Please let me.

He holds out a check.   For a lot of money.   Landon takes
it. Grateful.

                        LANDON
                 (quietly, to both
                  parents)
          Thank you.


INT. PARSONAGE - JAMIE'S BEDROOM - DAY

A smaller Jamie lies in a hospital bed, seemingly asleep.
Hooked to an IV. Bottles of pills. Landon dozes in a
comfortable chair. A nurse sits in a corner, reading.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                            111.

CONTINUED:

Eric and Clay stand in the doorway, not sure what to do.
Jamie opens her eyes, smiles.

                           JAMIE
             Don't wake Landon.

They tiptoe in.    Stand on either side of her bed.

                           JAMIE
             Do I look scary?

                              ERIC
             Not too bad.

                              CLAY
             You all right?

A dumb question but she handles it well.

                           JAMIE
                    (smiling)
             Things could be better.

Awkward pause.

                           CLAY
             We thought you'd be asleep --

                           JAMIE
                    (trying to help)
             I don't know what to say either.

Clay hands her an envelope.

                              JAMIE
             What is it?

She pulls out a stack of worn bills.

                            CLAY
             For the book drive.      Landon told
             us about it --

                           ERIC
             We told everyone at school.

Jamie takes their hands, holds them. Thanking them
silently. Her eyes shining with tears.


INT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

Landon sits at his desk, sketching the larger telescope,
making a few computations.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                           112.

CONTINUED:

A library book on Haley's Comet is open.      A stack of
similar books by his elbow.

Cynthia enters wearing her waitressing outfit.

                              CYNTHIA
             What can I do?

He shrugs.    Tears fill his eyes.

                           LANDON
             Everything's being done but it's
             not enough. I have to find
             something -- more.

                           CYNTHIA
                    (gently)
             Landon, honey. There's nothing
             more.

                           LANDON
             I don't mean about Jamie being
             sick. I mean about Jamie and me.

                           CYNTHIA
             Be with her when she wants.    Make
             sure she never feels alone.

Landon thinks his mother is also talking about herself.

                           LANDON
             Mom, I'm not going anywhere.   Not
             yet anyway.

Pause.

                           CYNTHIA
             When you are ready, I want you to
             feel free to go.

They embrace.


INT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - LATER

Landon opens Jamie's mother's book.     A photo of Jamie
falls out -- one taken by Belinda.


CLOSE ON PHOTO

Jamie, beautiful, smiling at the audience.

                                                       113.

LANDON

considers the photo, finds a page to tuck it into.


CLOSE ON HANDWRITTEN JOTTING

"For Landon" above some underlined text, a Psalm from the
Bible.

                        LANDON
                 (reading aloud)
          'I cry to you my Lord, my rock!
          Do not be deaf to me, for if you
          are silent, I shall go down to the
          pit like the rest. Hear my voice
          raised in petition as I cry to you
          for help, as I raise my hands, my
          Lord, toward your holy of holies.'

Landon knows Jamie underlined this for him.


INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Landon tears down the steps. Past his mother to the front
door. He's out the door before she even turns around.


INT. PARSONAGE - REVEREND SULLIVAN'S BEDROOM - MIDNIGHT

Reverend Sullivan sits up in bed. His feet find slippers
on the floor. He looks haggard, his hair thinner, his
face defeated.


INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The Reverend, wearing his robe, checks on his sleeping
daughter. The night nurse nods as he tucks in blankets.

A SOUND. Then another. Reverend Sullivan goes to the
window. Parts the drapes. Looks out.


HIS POV

A dozen flashlights in a big circle. Landon in the
middle, working feverishly on the new telescope.


EXT. BACK YARD - MOMENTS LATER

The back porch light comes on. Reverend Sullivan steps
out onto the back porch. Landon looks up.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                          114.

CONTINUED:

                            LANDON
                    (flushes, almost
                     manic)
             I have to finish it tonight.

Without a word, the Reverend turns around and goes back
inside. Leaving the porch light on. Landon goes back to
work.


EXT. BACK YARD - MINUTES LATER

Reverend Sullivan comes out. Dressed. He carries two
mugs of coffee and a brightly burning kerosene camp
lantern. Peace offerings.

He walks over, sets down the lantern, hands Landon a mug.
Ready to work.

                           LANDON
             I've almost finished the rocker.
             Did she order mirrors?

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             In there.

As they walk to the garage.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             You have materials for the side
             bearings?

                           LANDON
             I'm using an old phonographic
             turntable.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             For the focuser?

                           LANDON
             A chrome-plated brass pipe from a
             drain line.

The Reverend nods, impressed.    He yanks the garage door
up. Goes in.

                           LANDON
             You know about this stuff?

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             I helped Jamie with the first one.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                         115.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
                    (surprised)
             I thought she built it herself.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             She did. But hardly anyone does
             anything truly alone.

The Reverend carries out a large cardboard postal package.
Landon takes it as the Reverend lowers the garage door.

                           LANDON
                    (serious)
             I need to do this alone.

Reverend Sullivan searches Landon's face for a long
moment, understanding, then turns and heads for the back
door.


INT. CHURCH - REVEREND'S OFFICE - NEXT MORNING

Landon stands in the doorway. The Reverend is wiping his
glasses, his face, maybe of tears. He sees Landon.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             You finish?

                            LANDON
             A few minutes ago. I have to ask
             you something.

Long pause.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             When I was seventeen, I was sent
             up for a year for stealing a car.
                    (beat)
             Sometimes I still feel that boy
             inside me and I don't like him.
                    (beat)
             But I like you.

The Reverend stands, offers Landon his hand.     Landon takes
it. The two men shake. Allies now.


INT. JAMIE'S ROOM - THAT EVENING

Jamie opens her eyes. But can barely keep them open.
Groggy from pain medication. Landon's standing there.
Showered, clean clothes.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                              116.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
             We're going out.

He starts helping the nurse disconnect her IV.

                           JAMIE
             Can I -- go out?

                           LANDON
             You'll be fine for a few minutes.

Jamie looks at the nurse.    Uncertain.     The nurse nods.


EXT. PARSONAGE ROOF - NIGHT

Landon carries Jamie out a large attic window. The
finished large telescope is set up. Pointing at the sky.
She's in her nightgown, wrapped in a blanket.

                           JAMIE
                    (grateful, touching
                     it)
             It's beautiful... Thank you.

But she looks at the lights of the house and streets
around them.

                           JAMIE
             I don't know what we'll be able to
             see... Help me stand.

He checks his watch.

                           LANDON
             Wait a sec.

As she turns to him, questioning, the neighborhood
suddenly darkens as the street lamps and lights in every
nearby house are switched off.


EXT. DOWN STREET

Neighbors step outside.    Hold up binoculars.


EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH - PARKING LOT

Members of the Star Club and other students look through
traditional telescopes.

                                                         117.

EXT. PARSONAGE ROOF

Jamie hugs Landon in gratitude.

                         LANDON
           We have five minutes.

Jamie, tears streaming, braces herself against Landon and
she peers into the telescope eyepiece. She pulls back,
wipes her eyes, then looks again. She swings the
telescope into the correct position.


HER POV THROUGH TELESCOPE

Haley's Comet, its icy nucleus issuing the jets and
streamers of gas, dust, and debris that form the comet's
hazy head and long tail.

                         JAMIE (O.S.)
           The comet of the century...


BACK TO SCENE

She steps back so he can see. He looks quickly, then
moves aside so she can keep looking. She's completely
engrossed. A long, quiet moment, then:

                           LANDON
           You love me?

She leans away from the eyepiece and looks at him -- yes.

                         LANDON
           Will you do something for me?

                           JAMIE
           Landon.    I can't even do for
           myself.

                         LANDON
           But if you could, you would?

                           JAMIE
           Yes.

His throat tightens with nervousness, with hope, fear,
sadness, and love.

                         LANDON
           Will you marry me?

HER FACE

Illness, happiness, disbelief.

                                                          118.

EXT. SOUTHERN BAPTIST CHURCH - EARLY APRIL

A sea of pink, purple, and white blossoms.    Dogwoods,
wisteria, azaleas, and roses blooming.


INT. SOUTHERN BAPTIST CHURCH

Bursting with everyone who knows Jamie and Landon -- every
kid in their high school, including Eric, Clay, Belinda;
teachers, including Ms. Garber; Mr. Kelly; Luis and Isabel
and others from Jefferson High; her father's congregation;
Cynthia Carter; Dr. Carter's new wife and their two kids;
neighbors; hospital staff and home nurses.

Landon stands with his father by the altar.

The "WEDDING MARCH" begins...

The double doors at the back of the church open. Everyone
turns to look at the bride. Gasps of joy and sadness.


LANDON'S POV - JAMIE

Flanked by a nurse and Reverend Sullivan. She's wearing
her Lizzie dress from the play. It hangs loosely, but
still becomes her. She's a beautiful bride.


BACK TO SCENE

Landon swells with pride.

Jamie smiles. Then, leaning on her father, she slowly
makes her way down the aisle.

In the pews -- few dry eyes follow her.

Jamie -- halfway -- stops to rest and catch her breath.     A
moment later, she and her father continue.

A long, difficult walk.    A walk to remember.


AT ALTAR

The nurse rolls a wheelchair up as Jamie and her father
near.

Applause breaks out as Jamie reaches Landon's side.

Jamie sits.   Exhausted.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                         119.

CONTINUED:

Landon kneels to be the same height as Jamie in her chair.

Pause.   Dr. Carter kneels.   Showing solidarity with his
son.

Reverend Sullivan, standing, leans down to kiss Jamie's
cheek. Trying to keep his emotions in check.


LANDON AND JAMIE'S POV

Reverend Sullivan towering over them.


BACK TO SCENE

Reverend Sullivan kneels, too.

Jamie takes Landon's hand in her right hand, her father's
hand in her left. Linking the three together.

The congregation silences.

Reverend Sullivan looks up from his Bible.     Struggling.

                            REV. SULLIVAN
             As a father, I'm supposed to give
             away my daughter. But I can no
             more give Jamie away than I can
             give away my heart. But I can let
             another share in the joy she has
             given me. May God's blessings be
             with you both.

He reaches out, offering a hand to Landon.     Completing the
circle.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             Landon, repeat after me. Do you
             take...

As words are spoken and vows and rings exchanged, the
CAMERA MOVES ACROSS the faces of those at the altar --
Jamie, Landon, Dr. Carter.

TO the first row of the congregation -- Cynthia Carter,
Josh, Eric, Clay.

Then BACK row by row as the Reverend begins reading a
passage from the book Jamie's mother made for her. His
voice soft and melodious, like a poet reading his own
work.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

                           REV. SULLIVAN (O.S.)
             'Love is always patient and kind.
             It is never jealous. Love is
             never boastful or conceited. It
             is never rude or selfish. It does
             not take offense and is not
             resentful. Love takes no pleasure
             in other people's sins, but
             delights in the truth. It is
             always ready to excuse, to trust,
             to hope, and to endure whatever
             comes...'

And the CAMERA MOVES OUT the double doors to find...


PARSONAGE

in a different season.      Winter.

UP the front steps and INTO...


LIVING ROOM (PRESENT DAY)

As it is now, in present day.

The nurse disappears, leaving Landon Carter, 33, waiting.
Looking at a framed photo of Jamie as Lizzie in The
Rainmaker...

The nurse returns, helping an old man as he shuffles in.
Reverend Sullivan. He's stooped, thin, balding. His skin
parchment thin.

The two men embrace.       Stiff, uncomfortable, uncertain.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             You've been well?

                             LANDON
             Yes.   You?

                             REV. SULLIVAN
             Getting by.

Pause.   Why is he here?     The Reverend waits.

                           LANDON
                    (fumbling)
             I'm -- I'm returning something.

He twists the ring on his finger.      Removes it.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                               121.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
             This belongs to you.

He gives his wedding ring to the Reverend.          Pause.   Landon
searches for something meaningful to say.

                            LANDON
             She taught me -- everything.     She
             saved my life.

The Reverend turns away, overcome with sadness.         Realizing
now why Landon has come.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             You're marrying again.

                             LANDON
             Yes.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             Jamie wanted that. She told me.

Landon is grateful to know this.       He makes a move to go.
Then turns back.

                           LANDON
             I'm sorry she never got her
             miracle.

                             REV. SULLIVAN
             She did.    It was you.

Landon, deeply touched, embraces the old man again.
Warmly, fully. Two men still grieving, saying good-bye.

                           ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
             Jamie once said when you're
             feeling love, you're also feeling
             God.


EXT. NEUSE RIVER - THAT AFTERNOON

Landon walks alone.      His hair and clothing tousled by a
steady gentle wind.

                           ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
             She made me a believer. In love.
             In life. In the journey that
             never ends...

Landon stops.       Faces the wind.   Lets the air swirl over
him.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                         122.

CONTINUED:

                           ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
             ... And in the mystery of all
             things you can't see but feel
             everywhere around you...

He closes his eyes.    She's there...

                                                 FADE OUT.

               INTRO

               Inspired by a true story.

               We home in on a boat coming in to shore. Off walks a man, he 
               is carrying a backpack and wearing shades. 
 
               
               EXT. TOWN

               He walks through a town, passing various stores and the general 
               bustle of the people there. He notices a baby in a pram left 
               out on the sidewalk, then sees the mother is in an alleyway doing 
               what looks like a drug deal.
 
               EXT. LUMBER YARD

               Chris reads a closure notice on the door. A police car rolls 
               up.
 
                                     SHERIFF WATKINS
                         How ya doin'?

                                     CHRIS
                         Ok. When'd the mill close?

                                     SHERIFF WATKINS
                         Ahh 3 years this August. If ya lookin 
                         for work you might wanna try Aberdeen, 
                         that's the closest mill work you're 
                         gonna find around here.
 
                                     CHRIS
                         That's too bad.

                                     SHERIFF WATKINS
                         Nah just simple economics. Y'know we 
                         have a really nice casino here, the 
                         wild cherry. You wanna make some money 
                         maybe you wanna go on down there and 
                         try your luck at the blackjack tables.
 
                         
                                     CHRIS
                         Nah I don't think so. Thanks.

               Chris turns around and the sheriff notices his name on a bag.
 
               
                                     SHERIFF WATKINS
                         You're Chris Vaughn?

               The sheriff chuckles and steps out of the car.

                                     SHERIFF WATKINS
                         Well hell, I know all about you Chris. 
                         I know your folks, I'm sheriff Stan 
                         Watkins.
 
               They shake hands.

                                     CHRIS
                         How ya doin.

                         Nah I'm fine thank you.

                                     SHERIFF WATKINS
                         I insist.

                                     CHRIS
                         I'll walk.

                                     SHERIFF WATKINS
                         Hey it's my pleasure.

                                     CHRIS
                         It's ok.

                                     SHERIFF WATKINS
                         I won't take no for an answer (jokingly 
                         reaches for his gun). HEY! Get in the 
                         car.
 
               Chris raises his hands and the sheriff chuckles.

                                     SHERIFF WATKINS
                         Did I scare ya with that one?

                         8 years. Harstad was sheriff back then.
 
                         
                                     SHERIFF WATKINS
                         Harstad, yeah. Sad story. About 5 months 
                         back he fell asleep at the wheel and 
                         uhhh... hit a tree. Good man, good man 
                         and a good sheriff.
 
               
               EXT. THE FAMILY HOME

                                     CHRIS
                         Thanks for the ride.

                                     SHERIFF WATKINS
                         No problem, and uh Chris (hands him 
                         a piece of paper). It's election month... 
                         I'm your man.
 
               Chris takes the paper and smiles. He walks up the lane toward 
               the house, a simple white building clad in wood. A lady dressed 
               in a police uniform comes out.
 
                                     MICHELLE
                         Can I help you?

               Chris laughs.

                         Lil' brother.. You come over here and 
                         gimme a hug.
 
               They laugh together.

                                     MICHELLE
                         You look great.

                         Hey, I couldn't let you be the only 
                         one looking good in uniform. Hey ma! 
                         Chris is here!

                         set up on the lawn).

                         How ya doin!

               Chris hugs his mother, Connie. A man slowly emerges from the 
               front door.
 
                                     CONNIE

                         No.

               They hug again.

               INT. BEDROOM

               We can see from the window that it's raining heavily outside. 
               Chris sets about unpacking his things. Pete comes in looking 
               wet.
 
                                     PETE

               Pete looks at him.

                                     CHRIS
                         Ok, I'll crash on the floor, you crash 
                         on the bed.

                         Did you really kill people?

               Chris looks at him.

               
               EXT. OUTSIDE THE HOUSE

               A crappy camper van rolls up. A man steps out.

                                     CHRIS
                         Ray Ray! Ahaaa.

               Ray shrugs.

                         with my life too so uhh I went down 
                         to Seattle, got a guitar and became 
                         all about music. And then pretty soon 
                         I was about music and drugs, n pretty 
                         soon I was basically just about drugs. 
                         Ended up doin 2 years for B+E.
 
                                     CHRIS

                         my past. Matter of fact I talked to

               EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD

               A group of guys are there waiting, one of them holding a ball. 
               They salute as Chris walks up. They all laugh.

                         down.
 
                                     CHRIS
                         Why?

               a voice shouts 'HEADS UP' Chris catches a fast ball thrown from 
               behind. Jay steps out of his vehicle.

                         Not today.

               A football game ensues, there are two teams. Jay's guys vs Chris' 
               guys. On the sidelines Pete pulls up on a small motorcycle. Chris 
               notices Pete hanging around with kids smoking. It comes down 
               to the last play, the teams are huddled into two groups talking.
 
               
                                     RAY

                         put this to rest.

                         Ok Vaughn, last chance.

               Chris gets the ball and throws it. An opponent comes in hard 
               and tackles him low. He collapses. Ray runs for the ball but 
               gets clotheslined by Jay.
 
                                     JAY

                         It's the subtle attention to aesthetics 
                         that I find most impressive, blends 
                         in with the mountains SO nicely.

                         needs under one great big roof. You 
                         got your ATM machine, tellers to cash 
                         your paycheck, and when you're here 
                         you don't gotta worry about those lil 
                         things like child support, rent, the 
                         laws of mathematical probability.

               Chris' friends have led him to a stripping booth, his friend 
               inserts the money.

                         Bye! No drinking.

               His friends leave, closing the door behind them.

               A screen goes up and a striptease begins. The lady is dressed 
               in the style of a firewoman and has a pole in the center of the 
               stage. She dances around the pole and removes clothes.

               Chris notices something odd, he looks concerned.

                                     CROUPIER
                         Lookin' for a 6.

               The dice have landed and it's a 7. Jimmy hangs his head.

                         Let's see about that.

               Chris puts a load of money on the table.

                                     CHRIS
                         Bet you I'll roll a seven.

                                     CROUPIER
                         It's not your roll sir. SIR! It's not 
                         your roll. Call security.
 
               Chris has taken the dice. 

                                     CHRIS
                         Put your bets down on the pass line. 
                         These dice are comin up seven.
 
                                     JIMMY
                         Chris, why don't we just let it go?
 
                         
                                     CHRIS
                         No, we gonna let it ride Jimmy. The 
                         dice are comin up seven.
 
                                     CROUPIER
                         It's not your roll sir.

               Chris rolls the dice and sure enough it's a seven.

                         (To croupier) Why don't you just take 
                         care of that bet and we're even.
 
                                     CROUPIER
                         Well I would but it wasn't a legitimate 
                         bet, you're not the shooter. It's not 
                         your (Chris shoves him) ROLL sir.

                         Is there a problem?

                                     CHRIS
                         Yea, the problem is your dice are loaded. 
                         Does your boss know about this? Just 
                         gimme my money.
 
               The security guy grabs Chris around the neck. Chris elbows him 
               and throws him onto the table. The croupier takes a fighting 
               stance. Jimmy taps Chris on the shoulder.
 
                                     JIMMY
                         Come on, let's go! let's go!

               More security men appear, one of them knocks Jimmy out. A whole 
               fight breaks out, Ray gets knocked out. Chris beats off several 
               security men before taking an electric shock to the neck and 
               a baton to the face. Chris wakes up on a table under a light.

                         (Sees the tag around Chris' neck) Special 
                         forces? I'll take that.
 
               Chris grabs him by the neck but they beat him down again.

                                     BAD GUY 2
                         What are you doin?

                         forces... special treatment.
 
               He rips open Chris' shirt.

                                     BAD GUY 2
                         This guy knows Hamilton!

               A struggle ensues and Chris' chest is cut up.

               
               EXT. A BRIDGE

               We see Chris is crawling, badly hurt. A truck stops directly 
               in front of him. Chris passes out again.

                         can talk to him.
 
               The doctor nods.

               EXT. FAMILY HOUSE

               Chris has returned home. He's still in bad shape and his parents 
               help him out of the car. He insists on taking the steps by himself.

               Chris laughs.

               
               INT. LOUNGE

               A montage ensues with Chris on the couch, sometimes with Ray, 
               other times with Pete. Chris is recovering, and is exercising 
               by the end of it.
 
               
               INT. GARAGE

               Chris pulls the cover off an old truck. He smiles and gets in. 
               He starts the engine.

                         career choice but just didn't seem fair 
                         to take it out on an innocent truck.

                         about the mill. When I was a kid goin 
                         to visit you at work, the smell of that 
                         fresh-cut cedar. You remember that smell.

                         When did they go outta business? (Nods

               Jay pulls up in his car.

                         been pulled. I don't know how my security 
                         cameras didn't catch that.
 
               Jay starts to help Chris taking wood off the truck but Chris 
               throws it back on.

                         Wait wait... so they got a little rough, 
                         they were a bit edgy. Understandably. 
                         You don't know what kind of assholes 
                         they have to put up with on a daily 
                         basis. Look, they've been reprimanded. 
                         They say you went nuts man. I'm sorry. 
                         I know the proper term vets use is post

                         Whatever it was, you tore my place apart 
                         and it wasn't easy for me to get my 
                         guys agree not to press charges. Look

                         you have come to me? Look, I wanna bring 
                         you inside. Chris I wanna make you head

                         Ah well. I guess you probably need time 
                         to think about it. This is for you. 
                         It's a little something to help you 
                         get... Y'know..
 
               He puts down an envelope with money in it. Chris gives it back 
               to him.
 
                                     JAY
                         Come on man, don't be like that. I came 
                         all the way out here to your house just

               An officer is on the phone ignoring him.

                         Excuse me.

               The sheriff comes out.

                         They did an internal investigation. 
                         That's good enough for me.

                         Chris, I know you're familiar with the 
                         term 'no fly zone'. Hmm? Cause that's 
                         what the casino is. Since the mill closed 
                         down that casino is the main source 
                         of revenue in this town. So, case closed 
                         basically. I'll see ya.

                         and I talked to somebody with a badge. 
                         Sure as hell didn't seem like much of 
                         a sheriff.

               EXT. OUTSIDE SOME GARAGE

               The Vaughn's truck pulls up at speed. They enter a garage, Pete 
               is on a stretcher.

                         It was close. Crystal Meth.
 
                                     PETE
                         I'm sorry. I never did it before.

                                     KID
                         It's true. We mighta kinda pushed him 
                         into it. 
 
               Chris approaches the kid.

                                     CHRIS
                         Where'd you get the drugs?

                                     KID
                         I'm not really sure...

                                     CHRIS
                         Stop. Where?

                                     KID
                         From the security guys workin at the 
                         casino.
 
               Chris gets into his truck.

                                     CONNIE
                         Chris, wait. Call the police.

                                     CHRIS
                         No, that won't do any good.

               Chris speeds off. He pulls up at their home and enters the garage.
 
               
                                     DAD
                         Is Pete ok?

                                     CHRIS
                         He'll be fine.

               Chris is searching about and forces open a cupboard.

                                     DAD
                         What are you doin?

               Chris pulls out a shotgun and loads it.

                                     DAD
                         Aw Chris not like this. Chris listen 
                         to me. If you go outta here with that 
                         gun, they're gonna.. ne... Chris!
 
                         
               Chris drives to the casino, he cocks the shotgun but decides 
               to leave it in the truck. Instead he takes a piece of wood from 
               the back of his truck. He enters the casino with it. He smashes 
               a fruit machine. A guard comes up and Chris beats him. A fight 
               scene breaks out with Chris beating the guards and generally 
               trashing the place. He takes back his special forces dogtag from 
               the guard who stole it. Chris hurls his piece of wood at the 
               VIP lounge window, smashing it to pieces. Jay emerges from behind 
               it.
 
                                     JAY
                         Guess that changes our relationship 
                         a bit huh?
 
               Chris leaves. As he drives off in his truck, police cars appear 
               with sirens going. He pulls over.

                         I advise you to give this offer more 
                         than a little serious thought. If you 
                         go to trial you stand to do 18 years. 
                         This is a sweet plea, normally they 
                         wouldn't even put it on the table but 
                         your military record can't be ignored. 
                         Three months home arrest, some community 
                         service. Pretty generous offer Chris.

                         Look at it from the other side. There's 
                         over a dozen witnesses, none of em are 
                         gonna paint a very flattering picture.

                         was no chance of that. Me and my men 
                         we were just tryin to control him. He 
                         was highly trained, violent, very dangerous 
                         person.

                         So dangerous, so violent, so highly 
                         trained that he despatched six of the 
                         casino staff single handedly. His weapon 
                         of choice a simple piece of cedar. Which 
                         in his hand became a devastating force 
                         with one aim, to hurt people, destroy 
                         property.

                         He went directly for everything. He 
                         just came in and took over the place.

                         but ah nothing with this sort of violence.

                         Did he give you any kind of advanced 
                         warning? A chance to defend yourself.

                         We tussled, but he's a big guy. He was 
                         on a mission. Besides, he seemed to 
                         be too busy enjoying himself from what 
                         I could see.

                         So from what you saw, it seemed like 
                         he had some kinda purpose?

                         I grew up in this town. People used 
                         to walk tall in this town, they wouldn't 
                         have traded the mill for a crooked casino.

                         I was justified in what I did, and if

                         run for sheriff. And if elected, I'm

                         A casino is a license to print money.

                         make it playing college football, apparently 
                         couldn't make it in the army and not 
                         gonna make it as a cop.

               in the back of the head by Dad who is approaching down the stairs.

               The mill is dark, Chris is finding his way around using a torch. 
               He finds Jay sitting.

                         Hey Chris.

                                     CHRIS
                         Get up Jay.

                                     JAY
                         Just a sec. Remember we used to play 
                         hide n seek up here?
 
               Jay hits a metal saw which resonates making a metallic sound.
 
               
                                     JAY
                         That was my favourite sound. 

                                     CHRIS
                         Get up!

               Jay stands up and holds up his hands.

                                     JAY
                         Look... Chris... just...

               Jay hits a switch on the floor which opens a hatch. Chris falls 
               into the hatch but hangs onto the saw which is swinging over 
               it.
 
               Jay hits more switches, powering up the machinery.

                                     JAY
                         You wanna know what my new favourite 
                         sound's gonna be? The sound of you screaming 
                         like a little bitch.
 
               Jay hits Chris in the stomach with a pole a few times. Chris 
               grabs the pole and they both fall. Chris has hurt his leg. Chris 
               stumbles off into the woods. Jay grabs an axe and goes after 
               him, he swings the axe but misses and they both fall down a large 
               earthy embankment. At the bottom they come to their senses and 
               begin fighting again, Jay with his axe and Chris with a log he's 
               ripped off a tree. Chris knocks Jay out by hitting him hard in 
               the legs.
 
                                     CHRIS
                         You're right Jay, this does change our 
                         relationship. This is my town, you're 
                         under arrest.
 
               
               INT. WILD CHERRY CASINO

               Chris and Ray are packing everything, the place is boarded up. 
               
 
                                     CHRIS
                         That oughta do it. WHAT are you doin?
 
                         
                                     RAY
                         Gettin some souvenirs, I'm gonna miss 
                         the place!
 
                                     CHRIS
                         That's how it starts. Next you'll be 
                         accepting bribes, setting speed traps 
                         all over town, cuttin up trucks. Not 
                         to mention the cavity searches. 
 
                                     RAY
                         Speakin of which, do you think Jay's 
                         got a casino in the pen? 
 
                                     CHRIS
                         Could be.

                                     RAY
                         Runnin the shower tower with the felons. 
                         He's probably blowin on somebody's dice 
                         right now.
 
               They laugh as they drive off. The mill makes a horn noise.

                                     RAY
                         That's lunch.

                                     CHRIS
                         Let's go pick my old man and grab somethin 
                         to eat.
 
                                     RAY

	EXT. WALL STREET - EARLY MORNING

	FADE IN. THE STREET. The most famous third of a mile in the
	world. Towering landmark structures nearly blot out the
	dreary grey flannel sky. The morning rush hour crowds swarm
	through the dark, narrow streets like mice in a maze, all in
	pursuit of one thing: MONEY... CREDITS RUN.

	INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - EARLY MORNING

	We hear the ROAR of the trains pulling out of the station.
	Blurred faces, bodies, suits, hats, attache cases float into
	view pressed like sardines against the sides of a door which
	now open, releasing an outward velocity of anger and greed,
	one of them BUD FOX.

	EXT. SUBWAY EXIT - MORNING

	The bubbling mass charges up the stairs. Steam rises from a
	grating, shapes merging into the crowd. Past the HOMELESS
	VETS, the insane BAG LADY with 12 cats and 20 shopping bags
	huddled in the corner of Trinity Church...

	Bud the Fox straggling behind, in a crumpled raincoat, tie
	askew, young, very young, his bleary face buried in a Wall
	Street Journal, folded, 'subway style', as he crosses the
	street against the light.

				BUD
		Why Fox? Why didn't you buy...
		schmuck?

	A car honks, swerving past.

	INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

	Cavernous modern lobby. Bodies cramming into elevators. Bud,
	stuffing the newspaper into his coat, jams in.

	INT. ELEVATOR - MORNING

	Blank faces stare ahead, each lost in private thoughts, Bud
	again mouthing the thought, "stupid schmuck", his eyes
	catching a blond executive who quickly flicks her eyes away.
	Paranoia in the elevator. We quickly cut into private lives.

				WORRIED MAN (V.O.)
		... he'll sue me, could be for 5-6
		million, and he'll get a million,
		the house, they'll impound my
		paychecks...damn, damn, why did I
		sign that contract?

				BLACK BIKE MESSENGER (V.O.)
		... gotta get Lola in the sack man,
		take her to the Garden for the
		Terrells, Jimmy give me the tickets
		for 12 bucks, I pull the midnight
		shift, I could do 60 bucks... wow,
		check those legs out...

	His eyes on the same blonde exec who looks away, self-
	conscious about her legs. The elevator stops at a floor,
	discards only one person. The doors close a little too slowly.

				BLONDE EXECUTIVE (V.O.)
		... jerk...
			(shifts her thoughts)
		call Hanratty. The decimal points
		on the code are uncalibrated.
		Hoskins. The signatures on the bank
		draft. Boyle, that
		bitch...insurance...tax form. Shit,
		talk to Kahn.
			(recalling)
		That's Hanratty, Hoskins, Bank,
		Boyle and Kahn... H2B2K - shoot,
		insurance and theatre
		tix...H2B2K,I,T -- and the cleaners!
		repeat...

	Catching the eyes of Bud Fox once again wandering to her.
	Camera moving to Bud who looks away.

				BUD (V.O.)
		...sorry, what a fox... funny, the
		most beautiful girls in the world
		are always on the street or in
		elevators, never get to talk to
		them, shy ... my looks, never had
		confidence in them ...
		overcompensating work syndrome...
		prove your worth with money...
		'cept I'm not making any money...
			(pause, the elevator
			at another floor, slow)
		... wonder what all these people
		are thinking about.

	Camera moving slowly again over the eyes. The silence of
	individual tension reigns over all.

				ANGRY MAN (V.O.)
		...Screw him! I'll destroy that
		sonufabitch... he thinks he can
		break a contract with me he's got
		something to learn.

				SECRETARY (V.O.)
		...9:15!... he'll kill me this
		time, he will really kill me... oh
		come on elevator!... why do you
		stop on every floor...

	As the elevator stops again to disgorge two people.

				BIKE MESSENGER (V.O.)
			(pissed now at the elevator)
		... come on man, time is money
		man... One floor here I could do
		eleven blocks...

				BLONDE EXECUTIVE (V.O.)
		H2B2K,I,T,CL,P,O,T2...
			(pause, she looks
			like she forgot something)


				WORRIED MAN (V.O.)
		...goddamn elevators!...people, too
		many goddamn people in this world!

	The elevator finally comes to a slow stop... They wait,
	plead, beg, screech with the eyes.

	The door at last opens. None of them acknowledging each
	other, they all stampede out the door with an audible gasp
	of release, a collective sign akin to making it to a urinal
	after a punishing wait...

	The elevator tension is over, but the killer grind continues.

	INT. JACKSON, STEINEM INVESTMENT HOUSE - DAY

	Credits continue to run. Bud moves past the functional
	reception area, past CAROLYN, a cheerful young black girl.

				CAROLYN
		How you doing Buddy?

				BUD
		Great Carolyn, doing any better
		would be a sin...

	He slips off his overcoat, flicks some lint off his Paul
	Stuart $500 suit, and enters the main trading room.

	Brokers mill by their desks, gulping coffee, scanning the
	papers, the quotrons. The digital clock by the big board
	counter clicks to 9:26 am -- four minutes until the market
	opens. You can smell the hunger.

	Bud takes a deep breath, tosses the newspaper away and
	struts into the office -- fuck it -- it's a new day.

	MOVING past DAN STEEPLES, a flush-faced old-timer, a blue
	and white Yale tie, with a carnation in his lapel.

				BUD
		Morning, Dan. What's looking good
		today?

				STEEPLES
		If I know I wouldn't be in this
		business. Get out while you're
		young, kid. I came here one day, I
		sat down, and look at me now.

	Past CHARLIE CUSHING, on the phone, a handsome chunk of man
	with rugged good looks and Ivy League mannerisms.

				BUD
		...hey Chuckie, how's the woman-
		slayer?

				CHARLIE
		...still looking for the right 18
		year old wife, how you doing, pal?

				BUD
		...if I had your looks, better.

				CHARLIE
			(used to it)
		...takes years of genetics, pal,
		and a Yale education... and the
		right tailor.

				BUD
		...not that you learned anything,
		Chunk.

	Bud reaches his trading desk, whips open his briefcase and
	pulls out a computer print-out of last night's homework.

				BUD
		I gotta feeling we're going to make
		a killing today, Marv.

				MARV (O.S.)
		Yeah, where's your machine gun.

				BUD
		Joke about it. I was up all night
		charting these stocks. You want to
		see this or what?

	His associate, MARVIN, a manicky wise-guy, swivels over his
	chair from a nearby desk. He gives the charts a quick read.

				MARV
			(scowling)
		Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got
		it all upside down.
			(confidential)
		Okay, I'm giving this to you and
		you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for
		you. Take the Knicks against the
		Bullets, and my pick of the day --
		Duke to beat the spread against
		Wake Forest.

				BUD
		Thanks, Marv, with that I might be
		able to qualify for welfare.

	LOU MANNHEIM, strolls in, a dignified looking older broker
	in his late 60's, wearing an old brown brim hat with button
	down white shirt, narrow tie, very much a picture from
	another era... a kind humor in his eyes... but obviously
	ailing in the legs and breath department.

				BUD
			(friendly)
		You got a look in your eye, Mr.
		Mannheim... You got something for
		the small fry...

				MANNHEIM
		Jesus, can't make a buck in this
		market, country's going to hell
		faster than when that sonofabitch
		Roosevelt was around... too much
		cheap money sloshing around the
		world. The biggest mistake we ever
		made was letting Nixon get off the
		gold standard. Putney Drug--you
		boys might want to have a look at it.

				MARV
		Take 5 years for that company to
		turn around.

				MANNHEIM
		...but they got a good new drug.
		Stick to the fundamentals, that's
		how IBM and Hilton were built...good
		things sometimes take time.

	The stentorian voice of OFFICE MANAGER HIERONYMUS LYNCH
	booms over the intercom.

	We see him peering from behind the glass partition in hit
	office; tall, balding with a perpetual worried look on his
	face.

				LYNCH
		Attention. Please. Office Production
		is down ten percent this week. I
		recommend that you all go through
		your clients' investments for any
		portfolio adjustments. And don't
		forget -- double commissions today
		on our 'A' or better bond funds.
			(looking in Bud and
			Marv's direction)
		Especially you rookies. Also,
		remember, the sales contest ends
		tomorrow.

	Bud and Marvin roll their eyes. The digital clock flashes
	9:30. The CREDITS close.

				BUD
		And they're off and running!

	The room rises to a subtle but new energy level with the
	clatter of the ticker, speakers, teletype machines,
	newsprinters' Dow Jones and Reuters, phones ringing off the
	hook. Brokers are shouting orders, running for tickets,
	dodging each other; it's a controlled riot.

				BROKERS
		Here's a hot lead... Have I got one
		for you.... sell ... dump it all!!
		... 500 at an eighth, an eighth!...
		July fifties. April thirties...how
		bout those Decembers? You see where
		they're going? ... Morgan is
		selling a billion one at the close.
		Yeah. That's right, they're selling
		all over the place... we're still
		long on the treasuries -- $110
		million. What about the Japs?
		...Where am I?
			(confused at all the
			phone lights)
		We gotta lot of lights here! Let's
		pick 'em up.

				BUD
			(on phone)
		Jack, take 50 Gulf, with a 3/8 top,
		forget the hundred. What about
		Delroy? I can go long at 23, let's
		go long...Conwest Air -- let me
		check it...

	He looks up at the TICKER... stock quotes whizzing by.

				BUD (O.S. CONT'D)
		Up an eighth. How many you want?
		It's on the floor.

	He writes the order up.

	A shot of CHARLIE CUSHING yawning as he half-listens to his
	customer, resting the phone on his kneecaps.

						DISSOLVE TO:

	THE CLOCK... It's 2.30 p.m. We hear the relentless clatter
	of the board ticker, and the drone of disembodied voices,
	blarihg market information out of squawk boxes.

	Bud's desk is now cluttered with order tickets, literature,
	crumpled notes, beverage cups and a half-eaten sandwich.
	He's on the phone and from the look on his face, the caller
	on the other end is breaking his balls. Marvin paces past,
	making a dramatic phone pitch.

				MARV
		Dr. Beltzer has to have his
		information this minute! It
		concerns his future!

	Bud waves Marvin away, answers his caller, trying to keep
	cool, worried how as he sees Lynch, the office manager,
	coming over.

				BUD
		Hey Howard, I thought you were a
		gentleman. Sure it's gone down a
		little bit, but you got the tip
		from your printer, I didn't... Yeah
		you did. That's what you said.
			(heated)
		I didn't tell you to buy it, why
		would I tell you to sell it?
			(screaming)
		No, I can't give it back! Give it
		back to who? You own it!
			(beat)
		No, he's out right now.

	As he looks up and winks at Lynch, standing over him.

				BUD
			(cupping the receiver)
		... That's what you told us to say.

				LYNCH
		Give me that phone.
			(takes receiver)
		Yes, sir, this is the manager. What
		seems to be the problem?

				MARV
			(into his phone)
		What?... Well, how was I to know
		you were in surgery? What am I
		Marvin the mind reader here?

	Bud whispers, tensely. Lynch listens.

				BUD
		He's lying.

				LYNCH
		Okay, sir. I'll discuss this with
		the broker and I'll get back to you.
		You're welcome.

	Lynce hangs up and glares at Bud.

				LYNCH
		If I'm closing out this account. If
		he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you
		pay for it.

				BUD
		Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!

				LYNCH
		Fox, you're making more problems
		than you are sales.

				BUD
		I don't think you're being fair,
		sir. You assigned me this guy, and
		you know he's got a history...

				LYNCH
		Somebody has to pay for that error.
		And it's not me.

	Lynch walks off. Bud does some quick calculations in his head.

				MARV
			(reappearing)
		Buddy, buddy, buddy; little
		trouble, huh, today.

				BUD
			(devastated)
		Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've
		got to cover his loss to the tune
		of about seven grand! I'm tapped
		out man, American Express got a hit
		man looking for me.

				MARV
		Hey, things could be worse. It
		could've been my money. Let me help
		you out, rookie.

	He takes out his wallet and loans Bud a hundred bucks.

				BUD
		Thanks Marv, I'll make it good to
		you.
			(fervently)
		You know what my dream is? One day
		to be on the other end of that
		phone...

				MARV
		Just put me on the institutional
		side of the room where the real
		cheesecake is. You forgetting
		something?

	Marvin points up at the clock. Bud looks up... it's 2:40.
	Bud quickly composes himself. He picks up the phone, dialing
	purposefully.

				MARV (CONT'D)
		Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize
		it's big game hunters that bag the
		elephants, not retail brokers. I
		heard this story about Gekko... he
		was on the phone 30 seconds after
		the Challenger blew up selling NASA
		stocks short.

				BUD
		Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's
		right, and you know everyday I say
		to myself, today could be the day...
		So what do you say... will you
		marry me? Then please can you get
		me through to Mr. Gekko?

				MARV
			(coaching)
		It concerns his future!

				BUD
		Of course he's busy, and so am I.
		Five minutes. That's all I'm asking.
		I know that if he could only hear
		what I have to say... it would
		change his life.

	INT. GEKKO OFFICE - DAY

	NATALIE, a classy attractive Englishwoman is on the phone
	with Bud, somewhat amused by his manner. She is the personal
	secretary to multimillionaire, Wall Street trader and
	raider, Gordon Gekko. His windows look out on a panoramic
	view of the city and East River.

				NATALIE
		Mr. Fox, I've told you before, I'm
		sure you're a good broker, but our
		traders talk to the brokers, Mr.
		Gekko only deals with investment
		bankers. Yes, I shall give him your
		message ...

	As they're speaking, another SECRETARY leads two well-heeled
	JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN past her desk. As she opens the door to
	the inner office and ushers them inside, we catch a glimpse
	of a figure, pacing back and forth, talking animatedly on
	the phone by the huge corner window. HE IS GORDON GEKKO. We
	hear a deafening ROAR as we:

						DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. MCGREGOR'S BAR AND GRILL - NEAR LAGUARDIA AIRPORT -
	TWILIGHT

	In the background, a 747 ascends into the night sky,
	climbing over the roof tops of weathered brick tract houses.
	Bud, coat collar pulled up against the wind, crosses the
	street, entering a neighborhood bar. We see an old maroon
	Honda behind him.

	INT. MCGREGOR'S - TWILIGHT

	Dimly-lit, noisy, blue-collar airline bar. Machinists and
	mechanics still in their overalls at the bar, drinking,
	watching ESPN FIGHT NIGHT, on TV. Bud searches the crowd. A
	group of middle-aged men wave him over, BLUESTAR AIRLINES
	insignias on the pockets... CHARLIE DENT, a rugged, chain-
	smoking ex-Marine Sergeant, and DOMINICK AMATO, a big strong
	Italian greet Buddy as he comes over.

				CHARLIE
		Buddy boy, how ya doing?

				BUD
		Great Charlie, any better it'd be a
		sin.

				AMATO
			(slapping Bud)
		I hear all you guys on Wall Street
		are millionaires, when you gonna
		make us rich?

				BUD
		Gotta open an account to win the
		lottery, Dominick. Give me 15,000,
		you'll have a condo in Florida next
		Christmas.

				CARL
		... sure and we'll own the airline.
		If he makes anybody rich, let him
		make himself rich, so's he can pay
		off his school loans.

	As he signs an unemployment insurance form for one of his men.

				BUD
		... nice to see you in such a good
		mood Dad, what'd Mom do, give you
		fish for dinner? ... You're smoking
		too much, how many times do you
		gotta go to the hospital to ...

	Carl, inhaling his cigarette, grimaces formidably,
	terminating the subject.

				CARL
		...leave me alone willya. Only
		thing makes me feel good anymore.
		Spaghetti. She makes lousy
		spaghetti...

				BUD
		It's called pasta now Dad,
		spaghetti's out of date.

	Bud sitting down next to him, pats him around the shoulder.
	Dad, a sarcastic and gruff edge to him, makes a faint smile.
	He has a genuine affection and pride in his somewhat
	glamorous son.

				CARL
		... so am I. Whaddaya want, a beer?
			(to waitress)
		Hey Billie, bring another for the
		kid, he looks good, doesn't he?

	Dominick and Charlie go off. A pause. Father and son sizing
	each other up with a look.

				CARL
		... looks like you grown another
		inch... but you don't look so hot,
		getting bags under your eyes,
		starting to look old like me.

				BUD
		Ah, I had a tough day. Some jerk
		D.K'd me and I gotta cover his loss.

				CARL
		Speak English will ya.

				BUD
		D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was
		when the options he bought took a
		bath. He reneged on me.

				CARL
			(nods, satisfied)
		I told you not to go into that
		racket. You could've been a doctor
		or a lawyer,

				BUD
		Coulda been a contender.

				CARL (CONT.)
		you coulda stayed at Bluestar and
		been a supervisor in instead of
		going customer relations by now,
		'stead of going off and bein' a
		salesman.

				BUD
			(an old story between them)
		Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How
		many times I gotta tell you I'm an
		account executive, and pretty soon
		I'm going to the investment banking
		side of the firm.

				CARL
		You get on the phone and ask
		strangers for their money, right?
		You're a salesman.
	 
			BUD
			(ticked)
		Dad, it takes time. You gotta build
		a customer list. I'm doing it. I
		could make more money in one year
		as a broker than five years at the
		airline.

				CARL
		I don't get it, you get a
		scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000
		the first year, and 50 last year,
		where the hell is it?

				BUD
		50 K don't get you to first base in
		the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I
		pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of
		15,000, I got school loans, car
		loans, food, park my car costs me 3
		bills a month, I need good suits,
		that's $500 a pop, shoes...

				CARL
		So come home and live rent free,
		'stead of that cockroach palace you
		live in. $50,000 Jesus Christ, the
		world is off its rocker. I made
		$37,000 last year and you...

				BUD
		It's Queens, Dad and a 5% mortgage
		and you rent the top room--I gotta
		live in Manhattan to be a player,
		Dad. There's no nobility in poverty
		anymore, y'know. One day you're
		going to be proud of me, you'll
		see...
			(hurting)

				CARL
			(sees it)
		It's yourself you've got to be
		proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya
		need?

				BUD
			(beat)
		Can you spare three hundred? Pay
		you back next month, promise.

	Dad reaches into his pocket, looks at his cash. It hurts.
	 
			CARL
		...Got a 100 on me, you...

				BUD
			(embarrassed)
		Not in here Dad... please. Later.

	Dad shrugs, puts it away.

				CARL
		... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200
		there. Your brother never...
			(cuts off when he
			sees Buddy's face)
		...well, I always said money is
		something you need in case you
		don't die tomorrow...

				BUD
			(changes subject)
		How's Mom?

	Another man comes over with a bandage around his head and a
	compensation form for Carl to sign. ("Hey, chief").

				CARL
			(with affection)
		...same, pain in the ass, god bless
		her, talks too much... gonna take
		her to Florida next month... west
		coast, near Tampa, like to get out
		for good, but can't afford it.

				BUD
		...Work okay?

				CARL
			(lights another
			cigarette, grimaces)
		...this drug testing is driving my
		guys nuts. I got flagged for my
		blood pressure pills. The only good
		news is, we just met with the
		comptroller over some union
		stuff...'member that crash last
		summer? and the investigation?
		Well, the FAA is gonna rule it was
		a manufacturing flaw in the door
		latch mechanism. I kept telling 'em
		it wasn't maintenance, it was those
		goddamn greedy manufacturers out in
		Cincinnati. And I was right.

	He gives the signed form back to the injured man. (Carl:
	"Okay, Frank")

				BUD
		That's great Dad.

				CARL
		Damn right, it gets us out from
		under suspension. We'll get those
		new routes to Pittsburgh and Boston
		and the equipment we need. We're
		gonna compete with the big boys now.

				BUD
			(boasts)
		Hey to Bluestar, as your broker all
		I can advise is hold on to that
		stock Dad...

	They drink. Bud reflects a moment.

				BUD
		You sure about this FAA announcement?

				CARL
		About what?

				BUD
		The FAA announcement.

				CARL
		Sure I'm sure. Buddy, you got that
		mischievous look in your eyes. You
		used to smile just like that when
		you were a baby sleeping, just like
		that.

	Bud's mind racing elsewhere.

	INT. BUD'S APARTMENT - UPPER WEST SIDE - NIGHT

	A cramped studio facing an air shaft with bars on the window.
	Moving across to the sound of the radio alarm going off and
	the glib tones of a rock D.J. announcing the Met's latest
	streak ... The walls are papered with stock analyses and
	graphs, print out pages strewn across the floor. No other
	semblance of a personal life except clothes haphazardly
	tossed, Barron's and Fortune magazines. A GIRL's back is all
	we see, sleeping naked on the bed.

	Close on Bud's IBM computer -- his appointment calendar. Bud
	focusing on an underlined notation: G.G.'s BIRTHDAY.

	Bud stares at the clock: 4 a.m. He picks up a prospectus for
	a chemical company, starts reading.

	EXT. GEKKO BUILDING - MORNING

	Bud, crossing lower Broadway, enters a magnificent towering
	glass structure.

	INT. GORDON GEKKO PENTHOUSE OFFICES - MORNING

	NATALIE, Gekko's British secretary, is completing shorthand
	notes as the intercom buzzes. A logo for "GEKKO & CO. is
	behind her.

				RECEPTION
			(off)
		... I have a delivery here for Mr.
		Gekko. It's a personal item and the
		gentleman says you have to sign for
		it.

				NATALIE
			(frowning)
		...all right, send him in...

	INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

	Bud, somewhat nervous, is led down an impressive hallway
	hung with expensive modern art... past a huge Calder mobile
	and a pool of some 15 traders on phones, quotron terminals
	and keyboards... into Natalie's outer office.

				BUD
		Hello, Natalie, you recognize the
		voice? I'll give you a hint, you're
		thinking seriously about marrying
		me...

				NATALIE
			(recognizing the voice)
		What are you doing here?

				BUD
		...And you're even lovelier than I
		pictured. I brought a birthday
		present for Mr. Gekko.

				NATALIE
		First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't
		just come barging in here. And what
		makes you think it's his birthday?

	Bud takes out an old crumpled Fortune magazine cover of
	Gordon Gekko, entitled "Gekko the Great!"

				BUD
		It's in the bible, see. You better
		go buy him a present. Please,
		Natalie. Let me give him the gift;
		Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his
		favorite and hard to get.

				NATALIE
			(sighs)
		Stay here, I'll see what I can do.

	She takes the gift and enters Gekko's office. Bud paces
	nervously. Natalie re-appears, stern, but a note of
	compromise in her voice.

				NATALIE
		Wait outside.

	INT. GEKKO OFFICES - OUTSIDE RECEPTION AREA - DAY

	Bud on the courtesy phone, hangs up, looks nervously at his
	watch. Almost 12. He's lost some two hours of business.
	Natalie suddenly comes out, without a smile.

				NATALIE
		Five minutes...

	Bud brightens, pumping himself in the mirror, muttering.

				BUD
			(to Natalie)
		Well... life all comes down to a
		few moments, and this is one of 'em...

	He follows Natalie.

	INT. GORDON GEKKO'S OFFICE (BUD'S POV) - DAY

	Furnishings in hypermodern gray and black lacquer, Modern
	Art ranging from black field paintings by Ad Reinhardt to
	the smashed dishes of Julian Schnabel. Nautilus equipment,
	hi-tech gadgets are in evidence, including a splendid Howard
	Miller World Time Clock, and a world map...

	Three of Gekko's people, young MBA's dressed for success,
	are scattered about the room, on phones, calculators, coming
	in and out.

	GORDON GEKKO aka Gekko the Great as the media calls him,
	dressed in a custom English suit, paces on the phone with
	the restlessness of a caged tiger, a 50-foot extension cord
	attached to his blinking 130 line silver-plated telephone.
	On his ears is a headset.

	He is carrying on overlapping conversations with a myriad of
	bankers, partners and lawyers; pausing to issue commands to
	his aides while keeping his eye on the stock prides spitting
	across a bank of quotron monitors, carrying everything from
	New York Exchanges to London, commodities, gold, and
	currency values. A second Secretary and sometimes Natalie
	exit and enter with various messages written on a piece of
	paper, indicating a waiting party on the phone. Gekko often
	shakes his head "no".

				GEKKO
			(on phone)
		... what the hell is going on? I
		just saw 200,000 shares move, are
		we part of it, we better be, pal,
		or I'm gonna eat your lunch for
		you... get on 1.
			(switches lines)
		Sorry, love it at forty. It's an
		insult at fifty. Their analysts
		don't know preferred stock from
		livestock...
			(a beat, mischievous smile)
		wait for it to head south, then
		we'll raise the sperm count on the
		deal... right. Get back to me....
			(to Alex, an aide
			listening an the
			other line)
		This is the kid that's called me 59
		days in a row. Wants to be a player
			(to Bud)
		There oughta be a picture of you in
		the dictionary under persistence.
			(back to phone)
		Look, Jerry, I'm looking for
		negative control, no more than 30
		to 35%, just enouqh to block
		anybody else's merger plans and
		find out from the inside if the
		books are cooked. If it looks as
		good as on paper, we're in the kill
		zone. We lock and load pal...get on 3.

	ALEX DE BETANCOURT, a tall handsome Frenchman, jots a note
	and follows Gordon over to line 3. Gekko's dark intent eyes
	fixing briefly on Bud who stands waiting in the corner. He
	motions him to sit.

				GEKKO
			(new line)
		Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?...
		No, not interested.
			(eyes an Quotron, to
			Ollie, a trader)
		Ollie, start calling a the
		institutions, start with Marx at
		Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me
		that California retirement money,
		baby! And we're on our way!

				OLLIE
		You got it, G.G.

	OLLIE, a gigantic 200 pound man wearing pink suspenders,
	rises and walks to another phone, past Bud...

				GEKKO
			(back on line with
			Billy, listening)
		... check the arbs for MacDonald's.
		Yeah, I'm having a Mac attack.
		20,000 shares. For about 30 minutes.
		Lunch? Are you joking -- lunch is
		for wimps. Get back to me...
			(to Alex)
		4.

	Bud's eyes on the framed "tombstones" from the Wall Street
	Journal commemorating Gekko's successful deals; they hang
	like scalps from the walls. Gekko's eyes drifting to Bud, a
	friendly easy smile for a flick of an instant, he has
	genuine charm in his manner and though ultrafast verbally,
	projects calm and confidence at the center. A man who
	obviously loves what he does, to some small degree is
	flashing his stuff for the outsider.

				GEKKO
			(line 4)
		Look Harold, they're vulnerable,
		alright, but we don't want 'em to
		think they're under accumulation.
		Go slow. Call Geneva and the
		Bahamas for me, will ya? We feint
		towards it but we wait...

				ALEX
		What about tipping off Yurovich?

				GEKKO
			(grimaces)
		If I ever need surgery, get me the
		heart of an arb like Yurovich, it's
		never been used...Happy Holideals
		Harold...

	Hangs up, eyes to Bud. His headset comes off.

				BUD
			(nervous)
		How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox.

				GEKKO
		So you say. Nice to meet you; hope
		you're intelligent. Like these,
		how'd you get these?
			(indicating cigars)


				BUD
			(tries a smile, awkward)
		...got a connection at the airport.

	Gekko notes the answer, wrapping the cuff of a state-of-the-
	art, automatic blood pressure monitor around his arm and
	starts pumping it up. His aides continue on the phones.

				GEKKO
		So what s on your mind kimosabe?
		Why am I listening to you? Got to
		monitor my blood pressure, so
		whatever you do, don't upset me.

				BUD
		Oh no, no...

				GEKKO
			(demonstrating it)
		Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor
		computes your systolic and
		diastolic pressure. Has an LCD
		readout, and it's cost effective --
		less than one visit to the doctor.

				BUD
		I just want to let you know Mr.
		Gekko I read all about you at NYU
		Business, and I think you're an
		incredible genius and I've always
		dreamed of only one thing -- to do
		business with a man like you...

				GEKKO
			(smiles, impatient
			with the speech)
		So what firm you with, pal?

				BUD
		Jackson, Steinem...

				GEKKO
			(nods)
		...going places, good junk bond
		department, you got the financing
		on that Syndicam deal.

				BUD
		...Yeah, and we're working on some
		other interesting stuff.

				GEKKO
			(fishing)
		...A cosmetics company by any
		chance? What are you, the 12th man
		on the deal team? The last to know?

				BUD
			(smiles)
		Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.

				GEKKO
		So whatta you got for me, sport?
		Why are you here?

	Bud opens his attache case and rifles out a handful of
	briefs. Gekko noting the blood pressure reading and taking
	the cuff off his arm. Ollie, the big trader, ambles back in,
	says something to the third aide, a young intelligent-
	looking woman SUSAN TURNER.

				BUD
		Chart break-out on this one
		here...uh Whitewood-Young
		Industries...low P.E. Explosive
		earnings. 30% discount from book.
		Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders.
		Strong management.

				GEKKO
		It's a dog, what else you got,
		sport, besides connections at the
		airport?

				NATALIE
		Mr. Stevenson in San Fransisco.

	Gekko takes the call, cutting Bud off.

				GEKKO
		He respond to the offer? What? What
		the hell's Cromwell doing giving
		lecture tours when his company's
		losing 60 million a quarter? I
		guess he's giving lectures on how
		to lose money...if this guy opened
		a funeral parlor, no one would die,
		this turkey's totally brain
		dead...Well Christmas is over and
		business is business.
			(simultaneous to Ollie)
		Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch.
		Ollie I want every orifice in his
		body flowing red.

				OLLIE
			(laughs, on the phone)
		He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake.

	Gekko hanging up and buzzing an aide. Throws out an aside to
	Bud.

				GEKKO
		...doesn't look like it but the
		best trader on the street...
			(to Susan)
		Sue get the LBO analysis on Teldar
		Paper and bring it here...what else?

	Bud shifting, uncomfortable as Gekko finally swivels his
	attention back to him.

				BUD
			(coming right back)
		Tarafly...Analysts don't like it. I
		do. The breakup value is twice the
		market price. The deal finances
		itself. Sell off two divisions,
		keep...

	Aiex, knowing the stock, sneers, shares a look with Gekko
	who looks up at Bud with the first sign of interest.

				GEKKO
			(laughs)
		Not bad for a quant, but a dog with
		different fleas.
			(checks his hi-tech watch)
		Come on, tell me something I don't
		know. It's my birthday, pal,
		surprise me...

	As he opens a birthday card and feeds it into the SHREDDER
	that sits next to his desk over the waste basket. The sound
	it makes is soft and menacing. Buddy knows its fourth down
	and long, Gekko's attention is shifting to the quotron. In
	frustration, Bud blurts it out.

				BUD
			(standing)
		Bluestar Airlines.

	The camera moves on him now, sudden, more intense, in a
	sense trapping him.

				GEKKO
		...rings a bell somewhere. So what?

				BUD
		A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300
		pilots, flies northeast, Canada,
		some Florida and Caribbean routes...
		great slots in major cities...

				GEKKO
		...don't like airlines, lousy
		unions...

				BUD
		There was a crash last year. They
		just got a favorable ruling on a
		lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't
		know.

	Gekko looks up, remotely interested.

				GEKKO
		How do you know?

				BUD
			(hesitates, concerned)
		I know...the decision'll clear the
		way for new planes and route
		contracts. There's only a small
		float out there, so you should grab
		it. Good for a five point pop.

	Ollie comes back in, as excited as he ever will get under
	his rolls of flesh, his voice deadpan.

				OLLIE
		... just got 250,000 shares at 18
		1/4 from Janson, think I'll pull
		twice that at 18 1/2 outta the
		California pensions. We got close
		to half a million shares in the bag.

				GEKKO
		Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away
		Ollie.

				OLLIE
		And, I'm pretty sure we got the
		Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming
		in with us and I'm working on the
		Silverberg boys in Canada.

				GEKKO
		Rip their throats out and put them
		in your garbage compactor.
			(to Bud)
		Interesting. You got a card?

	Buddy thrusts a card into his hands. Gekko glances at it.

				BUD
		My home number's on the back...

				GEKKO
			(smiles, looks at card)
		Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas
		a day. I choose one.

	Bud stuffs his notes back into the briefcase, hoping for a
	word of encouragement in the awkward silence.

				BUD
		Well, hope to hear from you, sir.

	He turns and heads out the door, still shaken by the
	revelation he has made passing Susan who hurries in with a
	dossier.

	Gekko glances at it. As Bud leaves, he overhears:

				GEKKO
			(off)
		OK gang, looks like we're going
		over 5% in Teldar, start the
		lawyers on a tender offer and 13D,
		we keep going after everything in
		sight but don't pay over $22.
		They're gonna fight, they got Myers
		and Thromberg doing their legal,
		they make Nazis look like nice guys...

	INT. OUTSIDE GEKKO'S OFFICE - DAY

	Bud walks glumly past Natalie, certain that he's blown it.
	She's busy on the phone.

				BUD
		...thanks Natalie.

				NATALIE
			(buzzing inside, preoccupied)
		...have a nice day Mr. Stone.
			(wrong name, doesn't
			notice, to Gekko on phone)
		... Mr. Gekko, the conference call
		is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr.
		Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in
		Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms.
		Rosco in London. They're all on.

	The phone call goes behind closed doors. Bud walks out,
	dejected.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	Bud comes in, distracted, punches into his quatron. Teldar
	Paper comes up.

				MARV
			(comes over)
		...well, see him?

				BUD
			(mind on the computer)
		Yeah, but he didn't see me.

				MARV
		Cheer up buddy buddy. You shook
		Gekko the Great's hand and you
		still got all your fingers. He's
		not the only elephant in the jungle.

	INSERT: TELDAR PAPER. The quotron. Bud's eyes. Thinking to buy.

				MARV
			(looks)
		... got something from him? Teldar
		Paper?

	Bud wipes it off the screen, his mind made up, dismissing
	the temptation to buy.

				BUD
		...a dog with fleas.

	Lynch, the manager, stalks past with some telexes.

				LYNCH
		Where you been the last 3 hours,
		Fox? I wouldn't be sitting around
		chin wagging if I were you...
		plenty of names in that phone book
		to cold call...

	Marvin gives Lynch the Italian salute, behind his back.
	Grudgingly, Buddy flips open the massive New York phone book.

				MARV
		...got tickets for the Knicks
		tonight. Go out and cruise some
		bimbos afterwards, whaddaya say?

				BUD
			(shakes his head)
		...gotta read my reports.

				MARV
		Forget charts! We're not fund
		managers, Bud, churn 'em and burn
		'em. I'm offering you the Knicks
		and chicks. God save you before you
		turn into poor Steeples over there.

	Their eyes briefly on DAN STEEPLES, red faced, desperately
	trying to make a sale on the telephone, hangs up defeated.

				BUD
		...preferably Lou Mannheim...

	Their eyes briefly on LOU MANNHEIM, in his private office,
	sitting there slumped, thinking, smoking as he watches the
	quotron.

				MARV
		Nice guy but a loser. Lost all his
		equity when his firm went belly up
		in the recession of 71. you wanna
		be coming in here in your late
		sixties still pitching? ...
		Whatever happened to that cute
		analyst at Thudder, Wicks? ...
		Cindy? Susan?

				BUD
		Cindy. Having sex with her is like
		reading the Wall Street Journal
		'cept the Journal don't talk back.
		'Sides this AIDS crap is ruining
		romance, nobody trusts anybody
		anymore, gotta get a blood test in
		the toilet before you leave a bar
		together, somebody oughtta invent
		an AIDS dipstick, no kidding, make
		a fortune. I gotta get to work...
		Z's today.
			(hitting the phone
			with the directory)

	The pool SECRETARY, GINA, calls out.

				GINA
		Call for you Buddy.

				BUD
			(taking it)
		Bud Fox.

	Bud rears up in his seat. A change. Marvin notices.

	INT. GORDON GEKKO OFFICE - SIMULTANEOUS - DAY

	Gekko talks into his speaker phone, gazing out the window.

				GEKKO
		Alright Bud Fox... buy me twenty
		thousand shares of Bluestar. No
		more than 15 1/8, 3/8 tops, and
		don't screw it up sport.

	INT. BUD'S CUBICLE - DAY

	The camera tracks around and in on him climactically as the
	Music Theme rises to ensnare him... We end close on Bud.
	Dumbstruck.

				BUD
		Yes, sir. Thank you. You won't
		regret it.

	He hangs up, stunned still, rises from his chair, unbuttons
	his collar and feverishly starts writing the ticket.

				MARV
		Got a little action there, eh buddy?

				BUD
		Marv,
			(turns triumphant)
		...I just bagged the elephant!

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - NIGHT

	The upper West Side. The young, the rich and the restless
	parade along the avenue, jamming the neighborhood restaurants
	and bars. Bud glides along, feeling a part of the crowd now,
	past a dreadlocked DERELICT swigging Thunderbird and
	shouting obscenities, shaking a wooden African spear.

	INT. RESTAURANT/BAR - NIGHT

	Inside a glitzy neighborhood singles bar in which Bud stops,
	everybody seems to be young and drinking margueritas. Bud
	orders a beer, surveying the room like a veteran, overhearing
	the conversation of a YOUNG TRADER to two other broker types.

				YOUNG TRADER
		...you know Marty Wyndham? He
		netted $650,000 out of that
		merger...26 years old, the guy's
		Rambo. Got himself a Porsche Turbo
		Cabriolet about 75 thou, got a
		house in Westhampton, penthouse on
		Second Avenue, gets up at 2:30 in
		the morning, he's in the office at
		4...guy never sleeps...Rambo genes...

	He blathers on as Bud surveys the room, noticing an ELEGANT
	BLONDE with a striking aloof beauty, very much the debutante
	dream Grace Kelly type, so refined that you wonder what she
	could possibly be doing out at night in public alone.

	Bud summons his courage, catches his breath, makes his way
	over... She sees him approach, obviously doesn't wish to
	talk, eyes darting elsewhere like a nervous deer.

				BUD
			(awkward)
		Hi...can I buy you a drink? I'm
		celebrating tonight.

				BLONDE
			(disdainful)
		Please, no thanks...
			(looking away)

				BUD
		Look, I know you get approached a
		lot by dubious men, but I'm
		different, I never talk to
		strangers, all my life I've been
		waiting for the right person to
		walk across the room...
		you're that person, you don't know
		it but I do and if you walk away
		now I'll never see you again or you
		me. You'll grow old.

				BLONDE
		Oh really.

				BUD (CONT'D)
		I'll grow old. We'll both die. And
		we'll never have known each other.
		That's sad. At least one drink for
		a dreamer...What's your favorite
		drink?

	She looks at him, not quite sure. Is he serious or glib?

				BLONDE
			(uncommitted)
		Grand Marnier.

				BUD
		Sounds like a french word, what is it?

				BLONDE
		It's a romantic and tragic drink.

				BUD
		Sounds tempting. I prefer mine with
		a twist of fate. You know like us
		meeting. Don't go away...

	Maybe, just maybe she's his! His eyes show it as he hurries
	back to the bar to order. As he gets the bartender's
	attention, he turns and sees that she is joined by a MAN who
	looks as if he stepped out of the pages of GQ. Together they
	walk away. Stung, Bud watches as the woman of his dreams
	disappears out the door.

				BARTENDER
		What do you want?

				BUD
		...I just lost it.

	EXT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT (RAIN)

	Bud and a DATE he's obviously just picked up, are struggling
	to be seen in a mass of people trying to get in the hottest
	new club in Manhattan. Bud easing forward along the ropes to
	a large BOUNCER who roughly pushes one of the bridge-and-
	tunnel kids back across the rope.

	Joe discreetly shows him $50 but they guy says: "No room!,"
	humiliating him in front of his date. The bouncer shoving
	Bud aside as Gordon Gekko and KATE, his wife, and ENTOURAGE
	(ALEX, others) are shown through the ropes into the door.
	Bud says something to Gordon but it gets lost in the confusion.

	EXT. 79TH STREET & BROADWAY - EARLY DAY

	People pouring into the subway on the way to work. Bud
	rifles through the Financial Times he's just bought at the
	newsstand and finds the article he was looking for: BLUESTAR
	EXONERATED IN 1984 CRASH. He thrusts his fist in the air,
	victoriously...bounds down the subway stairs.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	Bud's on the quotron and the phone; the word's spread around
	the office, he's landed Gekko and brokers drop by his desk
	to get the lowdown.

				BUD
			(on the phone)
		What's it at now? Still moving. Great!

				STEEPLES
		The man of the day. Pour some water
		on him to cool him off...one of
		these days I want to know how you
		got Gekko's account.

				BUD
			(indicating Dan's
			Yale tie)
		My magic tie, Dan.

				STEEPLES
		I'll trade you.

	Lou Mannheim and a Chinese LADY BROKER intersect.

				CHINESE LADY
		Gordo the Great, way to go.

				MANNHEIM
			(pleased)
		Good little company. I remember
		when we got the money for Bluestar
		to build those first planes, back
		in the fifties.

				CHINESE LADY
			(to Bud)
		I hear you're buying Teldar.

	Bud smiles back at her mischievously.

				BUD
		Sleep with me and the secrets of
		the West are yours.

				MANNHEIM
		Now that's a crap company, sure
		you'll make money on the takeover
		rumor, but what's being created.
		Nothing. No substance behind it.

				BUD
			(succinct)
		Old values. Buy.

	She hears him. As they go, Marvin swivels madly over in his
	chair.

				MARV
		Buddy, buddy, some buddy; why
		didn't you tell me to buy Bluestar.

				BUD
		Hey Marv, he demanded
		confidentiality...

				MARV
		Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar
		Airlines yesterday. Today they just
		happen to get good news and the
		stock goes bat shit. You must have
		ESP. A real Nostradamus.
			(Bud ignoring him,
			picking up the phone)
		Jesus Christ, what are friends for?

				BUD
		All right, I owe you one Marv.

				MARV
		That's right, next time a little
		birdie talks to you, talk to me too
		E.F. Hutton.

				GINA
			(pool secretary)
		Buddy, phone...Gordon Gekko!

	Everybody in the adjacent area turns and looks at Buddy like
	in an E.F. Hutton commercial.

				BUD
			(on phone)
		Hi Natalie...lunch at 21?
			(looks at watch)
		I'm out the door...

	As he springs up to leave, Lynch the manager happens to be
	strolling by. He nods pleasantly at Buddy.

				LYNCH
		Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't
		you join me and the partners for
		lunch tomorrow in the dining room?

				BUD
		I'd love to, Mr. Lynch, thank you.

	INT. 21 CLUB - DAY

	Dark mahagony wood, plush banquettes, a long oak bar. Bud
	enters the main dining room in a relatively outre suit that
	hangs on him embarrassingly as other businessmen in well-cut
	suits move around him and a Maitre d' sniffs, then leads him
	to where Gekko is parked, finishing up his lunch. A half
	finished plate is removed to make way for Bud.

				GEKKO
		Hi sport.

				BUD
			(still nervous)
		Nice to see you again Mr. Gekko.

	He's seated.

				GEKKO
		Try the steak tartare. It's off the
		menu but Louis'll make it for you...

				MAITRE D'
		Of course sir. And to drink?

	He looks at Gekko's bottled water.

				BUD
		Uh...just a Evian, thank you...

	The Maitre d' leaves. Gekko proudly pulls a tiny 3" by 6"
	color television out of his pocket with a 2" diagonal
	screen, flips it on to the Dow Jones avarages.

				GEKKO
		See this? Can you believe it? Two
		inch screen...

				BUD
		...I can't even see it...

				GEKKO
		...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old,
		electronics freak, got a liquid
		crystal display 'stead of an
		electronic beam. We're going into a
		new age pal. So how's business today.

				BUD
		Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth
		when I left the office. It might
		spin up to 25 by the bell...

				GEKKO
			(a tiny smile)
		Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for
		yourself? Bet you were on the phone
		two minutes after you got out of my
		office.

				BUD
			(flushes)
		No sir, that would've been illegal...

				GEKKO
			(doesn't believe him)
		Sure...relax sport, no one's gonna
		blow a whistle. Here, is this
		legal?...you wanna put it in my
		account?

	As he fishes a check out and drops it on Bud's plate.

	Greeting TWO BANKERS who stop at the table as Bud picks up
	the check, glances at it. His hand starts to tremble.

	The check is for $500,000.

				GEKKO
			(to bus boy, the
			bankers excited)
		Can we have the check over here for
		christ's sake.

				BUS BOY
			(rushing off)
		Yes sir!

				GEKKO
		Cover the Bluestar buy and put a
		couple hundred thou in one of those
		bow-wow stocks you mentioned. Pick
		the dog with the least fleas. Use a
		stop loss so your downside is
		50,000, and buy yourself a decent
		suit. You can't come in here
		looking like that.
			(Bud flushes, embarassed)
		Go to Morty Sills, Tell 'em I sent
		you.

				BUD
			(his genuine look)
		Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the
		chance. You won't regret this,
		you're with a winner.

				GEKKO
			(paying the check
			with cash)
		...put the rest of it in a money
		market account for now. I want to
		see what you know before I invest
		it...and save the cheap salesman
		talk, it's obvious.

				BUD
			(stung)
		Excuse me sir.

	Gekko rising to leave, the Maitre d' hovering around.

				GEKKO
		You heard me...I don't like losses
		sport. Nothing ruins my day more
		than losses... You do good, you get
		perks, all kinds of perks. Stay
		home tonight. Louis, take care of
		'im. Enjoy the lunch.

	Confused, Bud watches Gekko walk out of the room, pumping
	extended hands left and right. He holds the cashiers check
	up to his eyes, entranced by it, like a kid with his first
	dollar...as the raw steak tartare with an egg on top is put
	in front of him.

	INT. BUD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Bud is at his computer when the door bell rings. He's not
	expecting a visitor. When he opens the door he is knocked
	for a loop.

	A smashing looking LADY in a fitted Chanel suit, ropes of
	chains, short tight skirt, beautiful long legs, is standing
	there. Taking in the apartment, she hides her distaste.

				LISA
		Hello Bud, I'm Lisa, a friend of
		Gordon's.

				BUD
			(in a daze)
		Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure.
		Would you, uh, like to come in?

				LISA
		Didn't he tell you?
			(sighs)
		That's so like Gordon. Get dressed,
		we're going out.

				BUD
		We are?

	EXT. BUD'S BUILDING - NIGHT

	A stretch limo is parked in front, neighborhood WINOS
	inspecting it. The CHAUFFEUR opens the back door, as Lisa
	steps inside, Buddy in tow. The winos clap, howling at her.

	INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

	Bud in the back seat next to Lisa, gazes out the black
	tinted window as they drive away, then turns to her as she
	gives him a bottle of Champagne to open.

				BUD
		So, where are we going?

				LISA
		Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the
		River Cafe...or maybe we can just
		drive around for a while.
			(provocatively)
		Work up an appetite.

	She crosses her legs. Bud's eyes moving south. He pops the
	cork. Lisa does a little blow, offers him.

				LISA
		Want some?
			(he shorts)
		Gordon tells me you're a very
		talented broker. What do you like?

				BUD
			(feeling the rush)
		Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...

				LISA
		I got this guy who should know
		tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I
		been burned on tips. What do you
		think Bud?

				BUD
		Let's see, it closed at uh, 41
		1/8...
			(his voice cracking)
		Up a quarter...very attractive...
		about average yield...

	She unzips his fly.

				BUD
		Rising profits...strong balance
		sheets, good earnings per share.

				LISA
			(removing her blouse)
		So you're hot on this stock?

				BUD
			(nods, moaning)
		It's ready to take off. I'd jump
		all over it if I were you.

	As she pulls up her skirt and climbs on top of Buddy.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - MORNING

	Buddy, in an obviously new Mort Sills suit, struts past
	Carolyn at the reception desk, in high spirits.

				CAROLYN
			(smiles)
		Morning Buddy, you look happy.

				BUD
		Any better and I'd be guilty.

				CAROLYN
			(picking up the flow)
		You were never that innocent sugarpie.

				BUD
			(coyly)
		...how do you know? You wish...

						WIPE TO:

	Bud on the phone, gazing at the ticker, concern in his eyes.
	CLICKING of the tape ticker comes up over the music. He
	looks at Marv.

						WIPE TO:

	Later. Research reports piling up. Bud's secretary trying to
	get his attention. Bud's concern growing, as the green
	fluorescent numbers spit across the board. CLICKER growing
	louder. Pan to Marvin, hands cupped in prayer. To Dan
	Steeples who closes his eyes and shakes his head.

						WIPE TO:

	Close. Bud watching the tape -- dizzying, hypnotic blur of
	numbers. The roar of the clicker, drowning out the music...a
	runaway freight train.

						WIPE TO:

	Bud's hands clamped over his eyes. The numbers stop. Noise
	recedes. He opens his eyes, looks down at his desk, stacked
	with reports and phone messages, as the pool secretary,
	GINA, calls out. Marvin glumly coasts over in his chair.

				MARV
		Boy, we sure went down the toilet
		on that ugly bitch. If we were
		Japs, we'd have to stay with our
		aircraft.

				GINA
			(calls out)
		Mr. Gekko's office is after you. Be
		at the Wyatt Club courts at six...

	Bud looks worried, at Marvin.

	INT. WYATT CLUB SQUASH COURTS - DAY

	Games in progress on the four courts, heavy hitting sounds.
	Crossing to Gekko and Bud going at it. Bud is obviously the
	worse for wear.

				GEKKO
			(amused)
		...come on sport, you gotta try
		harder, I need some exercise for
		chrissake...

				BUD
			(out of breath)
		Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go
		on.

				GEKKO
		...finish out the game, Bud, push
		yourself...

	Meant paternally or sadistically, it's hard to tell. Gekko
	hits the ball, a big fat shot. Bud returns, Gekka moves him
	around the court, as if punishing him, the kid exhausted but
	the ball's never quite out of reach -- till Bud finally
	can't take it anymore and at the end of his breath, smashes
	into the wall and collapses. Gekko laughs. Bud lying there
	like a sad dog as Gekka hauls him up.

				GEKKO
		The public is out there throwing
		darts at a board, sport. I don't
		throw darts at a board. I only bet
		sure things. Read Sun Tzu's "The
		Art of War." 'every battle is won
		before it is ever fought.' Think
		about it.

	He exits the squash court.

	INT. WYATT CLUB STEAM ROOM - DAY

	Gekko and Bud sit alone, wreathed in steam.

				BUD
			(sweating)
		Nice club, Mr. Gekko...

				GEKKO
		Yeah... not bad for a City College
		boy. Bought my way into this club
		and now every one of these ivy
		league schmucks is sucking my
		kneecaps...I just got on the Board
		of the Zoological Society, cost me
		a million; that's the thing with
		WASPS -- they like animals but they
		can't stand people!

				BUD
			(easing into it)
		Uh, Mr. Gekko, we took a little
		loss today. We got stopped out on
		Tarafly...
			(Gekko waits)
		...about 50 thousand.

	Gekko's expression is frightening but cool.

				GEKKO
		I guess your father's not a union
		representative on that company.

				BUD
			(laughs, shocked)
		What? How do you know about my father?

				GEKKO
		The most valuable commodity I know
		of is information. Wouldn't you
		agree on that?

				BUD
			(exhaling deeply)
		Yes...

	INT. WYATT CLUB LOCKER ROOM - DAY

	Buddy is slumped on a bench after taking a shower, drinking
	a Coke. Gekko towelling himself down, getting dressed...naked
	man constantly stopping by to greet him. Hi Fred, hi Barry,
	how's the wife...still living in Larchmont? Yeah, still
	commuting... y'ever do anything with that Aetna Gas
	deal...nah...fishing for information, for a possible drink
	or meeting but Gekko stonewalls them all...

				GEKKO
		You're not as smart as I thought
		you were, Buddy boy, Listen hard --
		don't count on Graham and Dodd to
		make you a fortune, everybody in
		the market knows the theory, ever
		wonder why fund managers can't beat
		the S&P 500? 'Cause they're
		sheep -- and the sheep get
		slaughtered. I been in the business
		since '69. Most of these high paid
		MBAs from Harvard never make it.
		You need a system, discipline, good
		people, no deal junkies, no
		toreadores, the deal flow burns
		most people out by 35.
		Give me PSHs -- poor, smart and
		hungry. And no feelings. You don't
		win 'em all, you don't love 'em
		all, you keep on fighting, and if
		you need a friend, get a dog, it's
		trench warfare out there sport...
			(eyeing the surroundings)
		and in here too. I got twenty other
		brokers out there, analyzing Charts.
		I don't need another one. Talk to
		you sometime...

	He turns to go, Bud panicking. Is this the kissoff?

				BUD
			(with all his conviction)
		I'm not just another broker Mr.
		Gekko. If you give me another
		chance, I'll prove it to you. I'll
		go the extra yard for you. One more
		chance. Please...

	Gekko looks back, a beat, walks over to Bud, thrusts his
	towel hard at his stomach.

				GEKKO
		You want one more chance? Then stop
		sending me information and start
		getting me some. Get dressed, I'll
		show you my charts.

	INT. GEKKO LIMOUSINE - PARK AVENUE - DAY/TWILIGHT

	Cruising up Park Avenue. A panel slides open next to the bar
	with a portable computer on it. A television is turned on to
	the evening news, a low hum of voices. Gekko punches into
	the keyboard of the computer. A name appears an the screen...
	LAWRENCE WILDMAN with curriculum vitae following; address,
	phones, businesses...

				GEKKO
		Know the name?

				BUD
		'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the
		first raiders.

				GEKKO
			(amused, cold hatred)
		Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits
		he thinks he was born with a better
		pot to piss in... bribed an old
		secretary of mine to open bar mouth
		and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right
		out from under me. Wildman the
		white knight.

				BUD
			(excited)
		I remember that deal. You were
		involved?

	Gekko shuts off the computer and slides it back into the
	housing, his eyes taking in the low-volume news.

				GEKKO
		Revenge is a dish best served
		cold... well, it's payback time,
		sport.
			(looking out suddenly)
		... see that building? I bought
		into it ten years ago. It was my
		first real estate deal. I sold it a
		couple of years later and made an
		$800,000 dollar profit. It was
		better than sex. At that time I
		thought that was all tne money in
		the world...
			(drinks)
		Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a
		mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me
		half the picture, then he got fired...

				BUD
		I don't understand.

				GEKKO
		Wildman's in town. He just became
		an American citizen. Something
		big's about to go down. I want to
		know where he goes and who he sees.
		I want you, sport, to give me the
		missing half of the picture...

				BUD
		Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...
			(shaken)
		It's not what I do. I could lose my
		license. If the SEC found out, I
		could go to jail. It's inside
		information, isn't it?

				GEKKO
			(scratches his head wryly)
		Inside information. Oh you mean
		like when a father tells his son
		about a court ruling on an airline?
		Or someone overhears me saying I'm
		gonna buy Teldar Paper? Or the
		chairman of the board of XYZ
		suddenly knows it's time to blow
		out XYZ. You mean that?
			(a piercing look)
		I'm afraid sport, unless you got a
		father on the board of directors of
		another company, you and I are
		gonna have a hard time doing any
		business...

	Bud downs the rest of his drink, upset by the darkening mood.
	There's something very powerful and frighteninq about Gekko.

				BUD
		What about hard work?

				GEKKO
		What about it? You work hard. I'll
		bet you stayed up all night
		analyzing that dog you bought. And
		where'd it get you?... my father
		worked hard too like an elephant
		pushing electrical supplies. And he
		dropped dead at 49 with a heart
		attack and a tax bill and the bank
		pissed on his grave and took the
		house; my mom ended up working in a
		dish factory... Wake up pal, if
		you're not inside you're outside.
		And I'm not talking a $200,000 a
		year working Wall Street stiff
		flying first class and being
		"comfortable", I'm talking rich
		pal, rich enough to fly in your own
		jet, rich enough not to waste time,
		50-100 million, a player Bud -- or
		nothing. You had what it takes to
		let through my door. Next question:
		You got what it takes to stay...??

	The car stopping in traffic. Horns honking.

				GEKKO
			(pointing)
		Look out there...

	THEIR POV -- a STREET CORNER. A richly dressed EXECUTIVE
	stands at the curb next to the BUM with a shopping cart
	filled with garbage.

				GEKKO (O.S.)
		You really think the difference
		'tween this guy and that guy is
		luck? Mohammed, pull over.

	The car pulls over. Gekko checks his watch, pulls out the
	telephone.

				GEKKO
		...when it comes to money, sport,
		everybody's of the same religion.
		Or should be... Hope you don't mind
		if I let you off here, I'm late for
		a meeting. Good bye, nice knowing you.

	EXT. PARK AVENUE - TWLIGHT

	The CHAUFFEUR lets Bud out the door... Bud looks back at Gekko.

				BUD
		All right, Mr. Gekko...you got me.

	His eyes telling us he is weighed down by chains of guilt.

	Gekko smiles, gazes at the twilight skyline, a sudden look
	of contentment.

				GEKKO
		Yeah, it's a beautiful night. I
		love this hot stinkin' city.
			(pointing up Park Avenue)
		... nothing else like it in the
		world. Seven million people living
		on each other's heads, kids born,
		millionaires dying, people praying,
		junkies, whores, wills, lawyers,
		deals, parties, sex... guys like
		you sport -- dreaming about the big
		score. You know the best thing
		about New York is everything you
		can do here. And the worst thing is
		everything you can't do here...

	He shuts the door. Bud watches as the limo drives off.

	EXT. FIFTH AVENUE APARTMENT - DAY

	Bud, in a suit, waits next to a motorcycle across from one
	of the most desirable addresses in New York.

	The Doorman rushes to open the door under the canopy as a
	tall strong man in his fifties emerges with a LAWYER TYPE
	and a FEMALE EXECUTIVE. The man is SIR LAWRENCE WILDMAN and
	his manner and gait convey the impression of an authoritative
	presence with little patience as the chauffeur opens the
	door and he slides into the back seat of the limo.

	Buddy, astride Marv's Kawasaki 500, hits the streets after
	him. The music through the following Montage should suggest
	a chase brio.

	EXT. WALL STREET BUILIDING - DAY

	Bud shooting past the Trinity Church structure... Wildman
	gets out of his limo with his people, strides into the lobby.

	Bud quickly parks his bike on the sidewalk and rushes in
	after them... not a second too late.

	INT. LOBBY - WALL STREET BUILDING - DAY

	Bud just manages squeeze in the elevator with Wildman and
	crew -- and -- a couple of other early birds -- as the doors
	close.

	INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

	Bud eyeing Wildman, looks away as Wildman looks back at him,
	an edge of defiance to him, why are you staring at me? Not
	the world's most likeable personality.

	INT. KAHN, SEIDELMAN - OUTER OFFICE - DAY

	The doors open and Wildman and Co. step out into the
	reception area of Kahn, Seidelman... The doors close and
	Buddy continues upward.

	EXT. WALL STREET BUILDING - LATER MORNING

	The street now jammed with people hurrying to work. Buddy
	paces the curb, reacting when Wildman walks out, saying
	goodbye to the female executive and getting in the limo with
	his lawyer... Buddy follows.

	INT. LE CIRQUE RESTAURANT - PARK AVENUE - DAY

	Formal French haute cuisine. Power lunches in progress. As
	Wildman is seated with several well-dressed BANKERS at a
	good table, Bud tries to wrangle a table (next to Mr.
	Wildman on top of everything from a stiff looking Maitre d'
	who shakes his head, barely concealing his attitude towards
	Buddy's youth and general demeanor.

	EXT. LE CIRQUE - DAY

	Buddy waits outside, bored, as Wildman steps out, shakes
	hands with the bankers... Bud making an entry into his
	notebook like any good spy.

	EXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL QUEENS - DAY

	Music rising to triumphant proportions. AERIAL SHOT of Limo
	emerging from the tunnel and onto the Long Island Expressway.
	CAMERA MOVES IN, picking up Buddy on the Kawasaki, darting
	through lanes, staying several car lengths behind.

	EXT. LAGUARDIA AIRPORT - DAY

	The Limo winds its way along the perimeter road, past
	commercial airliners. It takes the turnoff for Butler
	Aviation. Buddy exits the ramp shortly after them.

	EXT. BUTLER AVIATION AIRFIELD - DAY

	A corporate saberliner jet, its engines running, idles at
	the end of the taxiway. The limo pulls up along the tarmac
	next to it and Wildman steps out, walking past a MECHANIC to
	the stairs of the plane. A STEWARDESS waits for him.

	EXT. RAMP - DAY

	Bud watches, wondering what to do as the plane taxies down
	the runway. He spots the flight mechanic and the answer
	comes to him. He starts running towards the mechanic.

	EXT. APRON - DAY

	Bud races up to the mechanic.

				BUD
		Oh shit, don't tell me Mr. Wildman
		was on board that plane?
			(the mechanic nods)
		My boss is gonna kill me. I was
		supposed to give him this.
			(holding his notebook)
		You know where that plane is going?

				MECHANIC
			(walking off)
		Erie, Pennsylvania...

	INT. PHONE BOOTH - AIRLINES TERMINAL - DAY

				BUD
			(into phone, proudly)
		...after spending the morning at
		Kahn, Seidelman -- on the 14th
		floor, the junk bond department --
		where Shane Mora works -- he had
		lunch at La Cirque with a group of
		well-dressed heavyset bean-
		counters...
			(Gekko voice back:
			"the adjectives are
			redundant, sport")
		...he later stopped off at Morgan.
		I'd say from all the palm-pressing
		and sweet smiling going on that
		Larry got some nice fat financing...
		G.G.

	INT. GEKKO LIMOUSINE - HEADING DOWN PARK AVENUE - DAY

	Alex and Susan are with him. Gekko playing the computer,
	eyes lighting up on the phone.

				GEKKO
		...bright but not bright enough,
		Sherlock, roll the dice and play a
		little monopoly... what box would
		Sir Lawrence land on in Erie,
		Pennsylvania?

	INT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

	Bud slapping his face, realizing.

				BUD
		Jesus Christ, he's buying Anacott
		Steel!

	INT. GEKKO LIMO - DAY

	Gordon already has the closing figures punched up on his
	quotron. Calls his shot.

				GEKKO
		When the market opens tomorrow, buy
		five thousand March fifty calls.
		You hear me? Start buying ten
		thousand share blocks and take it
		up to fifty dollars. When it
		reaches fifty, you can let out a
		little taste to your friends.
		Then call this number -- 555-7617:
		tell the man "blue horseshoe loves
		Anacott Steel..." You scored, Buddy!
		Be in touch.
			(hangs up)


	He hangs up, looks at Alex and Susan.

				GEKKO
		Start buying Anacott Steel all over
		the board.

	INT. BLUESTAR MAINTENANCE HANGAR - SAME DAY

	A large company banner hangs from the rafters: "Bluestar -
	The Vision Goes On." Buddy's father, Carl, Charley Dent and
	Dominick Amato are changing the generator on a 727. A welder
	is repairing a wing seam. Buddy shouting to his Dad over the
	noise.

				BUD
		Hey Dad!... Hi ya Charlie...
		Dominick...

	They wave back, Carl climbing down a maintenance stand...
	lights up a cigarette.

				CARL
		What brings you out here...

				BUD
		Client. Got a private jet over at
		Butler Aviation... Dad, you always
		gotta light up when you see me,
		it's the...

				CARL
			(don't bother me look)
		Don't start, alright.

				BUD
		Alright. Why so pissed?

				CARL
		Goddamn fare wars are murdering us.
		Had to lay off five guys. Nothing I
		could do. What is it... money?

	Bud takes out his wallet, smiles, peels out 10 $100 bills.

				BUD
		Yeah, it is. In fact I'm doing
		great. New client. Whole new league.
		It's starting to happen Dad. The
		Big Leagues! You know what I'm saying.

	He sticks the cash in his hand.

				CARL
			(doesn't)
		Sure...lots of guys at the track
		talk like that... but how do you
		know you'll have any dough next
		month...
			(looking at the money)
		What's this? I gave you two hundred.

				BUD
		Dividend. I figure I owe you about
		five thousand in nickels and dimes...

				CARL
			(tries to give it back)
		...don't be crazy. Put it to your
		school loans.

				BUD
		Don't worry about the loans. I'm
		doing good Dad and it's gonna stay
		that way now... least buy yourself
		a new suit.

				CARL
		What do I need a fancy suit for. I
		don't hobnob with the jet set. I
		just fix their planes.

	Buddy forces the money into his hand.

				BUD
		...then buy yourself a decent
		bowling jacket so when you take Mom
		out you don't look like the Roto
		Rooter man. Come on, for godsakes,
		that's what money's for. Enjoy
		yourself...

	Touched, his father shakes his head and smiles. He takes it.

				CARL
		Problem with money is you never
		have enough or you got too much --
		and when you got it you're never
		happy 'cause somebody's always
		trying to take it away from you.
		Money's one giant pain in the ass
		y'ask me... thanks.

				BUD
			(admiration)
		... Dad, you should've been a CEO.
		How about dinner?

				CARL
		Whatever night you like.

				BUD
			(remembering)
		Wait... next week's booked. Let me
		check with my girl and get back to
		you on Monday.

				CARL
			(laughs at his new lifestyle)
		Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll
		still be here.

				BUD
		...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking,
		you hear?

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	Bud silent, an intent look on his face, gazing up at the
	digital clock... as it flicks to 9:30... post time.

	Tickers, squawk boxes and shouting erupt.

	Bud calls in his order: "10,000 AN STL 46... and let me know
	how the options are opening."

	Music skips along in a revolving madcap fashion.

	INT. FLOOR OF AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE - DAY

	A CLERK hands the buy order to the FLOOR MANAGER. He starts
	writing a ticket as we pull back:

	INT. AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE - DAY

	Company floor traders are jammed into a narrow booth,
	frantically takinq orders over phones and telex machines.

	The FLOOR MANAGER gives the ticket to a RUNNER, a young man
	wearing worn sneakers, who dashes off. We follow him across
	the scruffy Exchange Floor, as he weaves through a crush of
	traders crammed around horseshoe-shaped kiosks, cathode-ray
	tubes slung above them, displaying the latest prices in
	bright, green letters and numbers. Intermittent shrieks and
	howls, calls to buy and sell, issue from the far reaches of
	the labyrinthian room.

	As in the final leg of a relay race, the RUNNER hands the
	ticket off to a COMPANY TRADER, who is buying and selling at
	the post where Anacott Steel is traded. The TRADER checks
	the ticket and turns to the SPECIALIST, executing the order.

	The camera moves up as the Anacott Steel (AN STL) quote
	flashes across the broad tape -- as the price ticks up from
	46 to 46 1/4.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	Bud paces nervously at his desk, looking at his quotron. AN
	STL appears on the screen, now up to 47. Bud puts in another
	order.

	INT. STOCK EXCHANGE FLOOR - DAY

	The SAME RUNNER races over, handing Bud's next TICKET to the
	COMPANY TRADER.

	Tilt up to the broad tape.

	As ANACOTT STEEL, AN STL, rises to 48 1/8.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	On Bud, eating a sandwich, eyes glued to the ticker. AN STL
	has climbed to 48 3/4. Marv stalks by, shouting on the phone.
	Bud looks away from the ticker, pretending to read a report.
	When Marv disappears, Bud hastily calls in at 49.

	INT. STOCK EXCHANGE FLOOR - DAY

	On the tired RUNNER dodging through the crowd, and over to
	the TRADER handing him a new ticket.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	Close on the OFFICE TICKER -- as Anacott Steel hits 50.

	Buddy jumps up from his chair, and animatedly crosses to
	Marv who is on the phone, cold calling.

				MARV
		Tell Mr. Ehrlich I've got important
		financial news! It concerns his
		future.

	Bud presses down on the phone button, cutting him off.

				MARV
		What the hell...

				BUD
		Anacott Steel. Buy it.

	Marv looks at Joe and sees a look on his face that he's
	never seen before.

				MARV
			(nervous)
		Anacott Steel -- right.

	Bud leaves, Marv re-dials.

				MARV
		Dr. Beltzer, you're gonna love this!

	Lou Mannheim hangs up the phone, a troubled look. Bud leans
	into his office.

				BUD
		Mr. Mannheim, got a sure thing.
			(whispering)
		Anacott Steel.

				MANNHEIM
			(scoffs)
		No such thing Bud - 'cept death and
		taxes. Not a good company anymore,
		no fundamentals. What's going on
		Bud? Do you know something?
			(Bud uncomfortable,
			Lou reads it)
		Remember there're no short cuts
		son, quick buck artists come and go
		with every bull market but the
		steady players make it through the
		bear markets.
			(Bud anxious to go)
		You're part of something here, Bud.
		The money you make for people
		creates science and research jobs.
		Don't sell that out.

				BUD
		You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you
		gotta get to the big time first,
		then you can be a pillar and do
		good things.

				MANNHEIM
		Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.

				BUD
		It's a winner Mr. Mannheim, trust
		me -- buy.
			(exits)


	Charlie Cushing's on the phone.

				CHARLIE
		Gotcha baby, its do-able... meet
		you at the Wyatt Club... 3pm Dinner
		Thursday... Indochina. Then we'll
		kamikaze down to Nell's, chase a
		little cotton underwear--I know
		this 18 year old bimbo, man... you
		can take it to the bank...
			(hangs up)


				BUD
			(intersects)
		Wanna play some tennis Saturday?

				CHARLIE
		You mean teach you how to play.
		Can't. Going fly fishing in Canada,
		big client...

				BUD
			(disappointed)
		...you take that Anacott Steel?

				CHARLIE
			(winks)
		...light snack, but good, thanks
		pal, you're sharking your way up...

	Dan Steeples's talking confidentially on the phone.

				STEEPLES
		I've just heard the most lovely two
		words... 'Anacott Steel.'

	Buddy dialing the phone number that Gekko gave him. He
	speaks into the receiver, in a hushed voice.

				BUD
		...Blue horseshoe loves Anacott
		Steel.
			(hangs up)


	INT. WALL STREET JOURNAL OFFICE - DAY

	The REPORTER on the other end of the phone hangs up. He
	rises from his desk, strides across the busy news floor,
	over to an ASSOCIATE.

				REPORTER
		Anacott Steel's in play. Check the
		arbs.

	EXT. GEKKO BEACH HOUSE - BRIDGEHAMPTON - TWILIGHT

	Wind and waves. Gekko's modern, Sante Fe structure house
	sits on a dune overlooking the grey Atlantic.

				GEKKO (V.O.)
		Sweeten the offer, throw 2 bucks
		more in a convertible preferred.
		And 5 year contracts for themselves.

	INT. GEKKO LIVING ROOM - DAY

	Immense slanted ceilings, a vast clean modern space filled
	with dozens of contemporary art objects, junk sculptures,
	floor to ceiling windows radiating light, that look out on a
	cantilevered deck and pool - and the ocean beyond.

				GEKKO (CONT'D)
			(on the phone)
		... Cromwell wants to play
		financial chicken with me, we'll
		see who swerves first. Where the
		hell's Gene?

	Gekko slumps down on a sofa, exhausted, watching one of
	several news reports he master-controls with a remote.

				SUSAN
			(on phone)
		You sent him to Vermont to get the
		deposition from the CEO Cromwell
		fired.

				GEKKO
		...done and done. Night gang, and
		Susan no legs waving in the air
		tonight. I want you dreaming about
		Teldar Paper.

	During this, RUDY, Gordon's 3 year-old son, drives in in the
	latest electronic baby toy -- a Porsche-bodied electric car.
	Gekko hangs up, checks out a Reuters quotron positioned nearby.

				GEKKO
		Rudy Kazootee, how's my cutie!

	The kid jumps out of the car and scoots into his father's lap.

				RUDY
		Daddy bad boy! Bad boy! -- play
		with Wudi... Now!

				GEKKO
		No, not now Rudy. Daddy's making
		money to buy you toys. Daddy work.

				RUDY
		Daddy work bad boy!

	Gordon absently tossles Rudy's hair, his eyes glued to the
	TV. The kid senses it, jumps back off his lap and into the car.

				BUSINESS ANALYST
		...the big story tonight is Anacott
		Steel which closed at 51 1/8.  Up 5
		1/8 from yesterday's close on heavy
		trading...

	Kate, Gordon's beautiful, raven-haired wife, homemaker and
	antiquer, enters with the bovine-eyed AU PAIR GIRL from
	France... just at Rudy drives his car into a wall where it
	stalls, engines grinding.

				KATE
		I think somebody's playing hooky
		from the bathtub. Rudy, say good
		night DAddy...

				GEKKO
			(can't hear, to Kate)
		Shut that off, willya!

	Kate, upset with the noise, tries to pull her son nicely out
	of the car.

	The Korean HOUSEBOY coming in.

				HOUSEBOY
		Calls for you, sir, a reporter from
		Time magazine on two, says it's
		important... and a Mr. Fox on three.
	 
			GEKKO
			(annoyed)
		I come to the country and it's
		worse than the city! I'm not home...
			(changes mind, pushes in)
		Yeah?

				BUD
			(off)
		Mr. Gekko, I've been trying to
		reach you. We got the options. We
		got a good execution on them!

	Meanwhile, the kid has no intention of going anywhere and
	plants his feet and emits the loudest shrieking this side of
	the fat lady in the opera.

				GEKKO
		Nicole! Take him will you...

	Handing the bawling, writhing mass of anger to Nicole as if
	it were laundry she doesn't want to touch... Nicole takes
	him screaming out of the room... Gordon trying to concentrate
	on the TV.

						INTERCUT TO:

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	Papers and charts are strewn around, trailing down to a box
	of take-out pizza and empty beer bottles. Bud has stayed late.

				BUD
			(almost apologetic,
			speeding on the high
			of the buy...)
		I got all I could get which was
		750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50
		calls. Average price of $47 a share
		And $4 per contract for the call. I
		just wish I could've got more.

				GEKKO
		Don't expect to get it all, sport,
		you'll burn out. First rule of
		business is never get emotional
		about stock, clouds the judgment.
		Where do we stand?
	 
			BUSINESS ANALYST
		In response to an inquiry from the
		New York Stock Exchange, management
		issued a terse no comment. Wildman
		would not return phone calls.
		Analysts believe the company is
		worth $75 per share in a transaction.

				KATE
		John and Carmen are here and the
		Livingstons are on their way...

				GEKKO
			(nods, listening to phone)
		I'll be right there, fix them a drink.

				BUD
			(shifting the figures)
		...we have 37.2 million invested.
		At this point, we're up 3.1 million
		and some change. If it goes to 75
		bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.

				GEKKO
			(smiles)
		You're walking between the
		raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry
		is choking on his royal chamber pot
		by now.

				BUD
		My firm needs your signature on
		these option agreements tonight,
		sir, otherwise we could take a real
		bath tomorrow.

				GEKKO
			(sighs)
		...Can't it wait? I'm good for it.
			(Bud waits, "Sir")
		...Awright. Come out, get the
		directions from Natalie and hurry up.

	EXT. GEKKO'S BEACH HOUSE - BRIDGEHAMPTON - NIGHT

	Bud's P.O.V. as he pulls up to an austere, ultra-
	sophisticated monolith of glass and wood dominating a
	stretch of dune overlooking the Atlantic's angry surf.
	Several Jags, state of the art Jeeps and a Rolls are drawn
	up outside.

	Bud, getting out of his faded Honda, goes up the stairs to
	the door. He rings several times.

	A BLACK BUTLER opens it and looks at Buddy somewhat warily.
	Laughter and voices are heard from inside.

				BUTLER
			(pretentiously: high
			English accent)
		Can I help you?

				BUD
		Bud Fox. Got some papers for Mr.
		Gekko to sign.

				BUTLER
		Wait a moment please.

	Without thinking he closes the door in Joe's face. He stands
	there, harrassed peering around through a window on the lawn.
	A small gathering of friends in progress around a glowing
	fireplace. The butler waves him in from the door.

	INT. GEKKO ALCOVE - NIGHT

	Bud enters, as Gekko approaches.  He seems annoyed to be
	disturbed at his country home.

				BUD
			(apologetic)
		Sorry, Mr. Gekko.

				GEKKO
			(takes the papers)
		Allright. Wait here...

	About to go when his wife, Kate Gekko, comes over. A pretty
	dark-haired woman.

				KATE
		Problems?

				GEKKO
		No... Bud Fox, my wife, Kate...

	They exchange pleasantries.

				KATE
		You came from the city?
			(with a look to Gordon)
		Long drive, have a drink.

	Gekko doesn't seem to like the idea, but...

				GEKKO
		Yeah, why not, Bud boy...
	 
Kate's walking back inside to her guests, as Bud sidles over
	to Gekko.

				BUD
		...if you'd rather not, Mr. Gekko,
		I can leave...

	INT. GEKKO LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	They cross to the main living room.

				GEKKO
		...It's okay Buddy, you know Alex...
		Candice Rogers.
			(Alex and his date
			shake hands, faintly aloof)
		...This is Stone Livingston... and
		his wife Muffie.
			(a young stuffy
			banker in weekend
			corduroys looks at
			Bud as if he
			obviously doesn't belong)
		...Darien Taylor, Sam Ruspoli,
		Carmen Winters, Dick Brady... All
		old friends.

	Bud looking wide-eyed at the beautiful "Calvados" BLONDE
	he's been dreaming of for weeks... she's with Mr. GQ and
	doesn't recognize Bud, nods back, they all nod back,
	naturally suspicious of the young outsider... Rudy's TOY
	ROBOT wheels  around the floor with a drink on its tray,
	talking computer talk...

				STONE LIVINGSTON
			(charmed by it)
		...good idea Gordon, good help is
		hard to find these days but can he
		whip up a dry vodka martini...

				GEKKO
		...well he doesn't talk back or
		steal the silver and Dick's gonna
		get me an exemption on him, aren't
		you...
			(Dick Brady is
			obviously an accountant)


	Bud plucks a glass of wine from the robot's tray and plunks
	himself down on a sofa, overhearing the conversation between
	Muffie Livingston and Candice Rogers.

				MUFFIE
		...there I am in St. Kitt's in my
		new Kamali leopard skin V-cut
		bikini which is going to turn back
		the clock on our marriage five
		years, you know what I mean, and I
		can't even fit into it, my skin's
		all pink and inflamed, and I look
		like a walking social disease all
		because this Ukranian bitch botched
		the wax on my bikini line.

				CANDICE
			(revolted)
		Oh my god, how ghastly, you should
		sue her...

	The Korean houseboy has come over to Gekko.

				HOUSEBOY
		Call for you sir. Sir Larry
		Wildman, he says it's important...

	Bud tightens, so does the whole room hearing the name of the
	moment. Gekko smiles at Buddy.

				GEKKO
			(to houseboy)
		Make Mr. Livingston a martini would
		you Nyung, and this gentleman...
			(to Bud)
		Stick around, this could be fun...

	He goes to the alcove to take the call.

				MUFFIE
		So, I had to sit around the beach
		wearing a moo-moo for 10 days, my
		whole vacation ruined.
			(noticing as Bud
			laughs, chokes on the
			wine, spilling some
			on the couch)
		You just spilled your wine.

	Bud noticing the stain, starts wiping it.

				CANDICE
		You're just making it worse.

	INT. GEKKO ALCOVE - NIGHT (RAIN)

				GEKKO
			(on phone)
		Larry, what a surprise...
			(beat)
		Can it wait till tomorrow. I got
		some people over.
			(dryly)
		...if you feel that way Larry, come
		over.

	INT. GEKKO LIVINGROOM - NIGHT (RAIN)

	The blonde, DARIEN TAYLOR, is examining a modern sculpture
	as Buddy comes over with two Calvados.

				BUD
		Hello again, I been holding these
		drinks for us for the last three
		weeks.

				DARIEN
			(uncomprehending)
		Excuse me.

				BUD
		Grand Marnier. A romantic and
		tragic drink.

				DARIEN
		Oh yes, I remember you.

				BUD
		Destiny took us apart, but I knew
		it would bring us back together.

				DARIEN
		Aha. Poet or philosopher?

				BUD
		Stock broker. As in: never have so
		few done so little for so much. So
		what do you see in this?

	Bud indicates the painting in front of them -- a buffalo
	skull in the desert by Georgia O'Keefe.

				DARIEN
		I'd give anything to have this in
		my house, even for a week.

				BUD
		...few thousand dollars down the
		drain if you ask me.

				DARIEN
		Oh really?
			(looks at him quizically)
		Well, I guess you can kiss that
		career as an art appraiser goodbye,
		because we paid over four hundred
		thousand for it at the contemporary
		picture sale last June.

				BUD
			(chokes)
		You could have a great beach house
		for that.

				DARIEN
		Sure you could, in Wildwood, New
		Jersey. If you sold this,
			(indicates a Rothko
			hanging near the O'Keefe)
		you could have a pretty nice
		penthouse on Fifth. But you
		wouldn't have much left over for
		decoration.

				BUD
		Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough
		businessman, but somebody's really
		taking him to the cleaners here.

				DARIEN
		Not really. I'd say that Gordon is
		one of the most astute collectors
		around. He has a great eye and he
		only buys the best. Like this rug
		for instance, a silk Tabriz, the
		finest of its kind. The day after
		he bought it in London, a dealer
		representing the Saudi Royal Family
		offered him twice what he paid. It
		absolutely makes the room. See how
		this little bit of celadon in the
		border is picked up in the cushions
		oh the sofa... although...
			(she's really warming
			up to her subject now)
		I don't know if I would have used
		that tea dipped linen for the
		upholstery - too dingy.
		And it's a sacrilege having that
		Pre-Columbian pot in the center of
		the coffee table. Some dope might
		use it as an ashtray.

				BUD
		I gather you're a decorator.

				DARIEN
		You got it, a great spender of
		other people's money.

				BUD
		Well, if you're that good, you
		could probably do wonders at my place.

				DARIEN
		Where is it?

				BUD
		Upper West Side.

				DARIEN
			(losing interest fast)
		Oh really. Home of the exposed
		brick wall and the
			(shudders)
		houseplant.

				BUD
		Oh it's just a rental. I'm moving
		to the East Side soon. I've got a
		couple of deals brewing with Gordon.
			(shifts uncomfortably
			with his pretension)
		but that's just conversation...
		what about real things? Like dinner.
		The two of us. Friday. Cafe. Santo
		Domingo.

	Bud waits, staring suddenly and deeply into her eyes.

				DARIEN
		What if I have a previous engagement?

				BUD
		Break it.

				DARIEN
		I guess this must be destiny
		alright. My first yuppie apartment
		and...
			(pats him on the
			cheek flirtatiously)
		my first yuppie.

				BUD
			(gives her a steely glare)
		You may call me a yuppie... It's
		Mister Yuppie to you.

	They both laugh.

				BUD
			(gets serious)
		So. See you Friday.

				DARIEN
		You really do believe in destiny?

				BUD
		Only if I want something bad enough.

	Her date, Mr. GQ, SAMMY RUSPOLI intersects with Kate. A
	cultivated European air.

				SAM
		...there you go again, Darien,
		talking with strange men.

				KATE
		That's our Darien: elusive,
		reclusive, exclusive.
			(to Sam)
		You know Bud right? He works for
		Gordon...
			(Sam nodding, makes
			conversation, big smile)
		Sam's in banking. You staying for
		dinner Bud?

				BUD
			(hesitant, eyes Darien)
		No, I'm afraid I've got to get some
		work...

	Kate noticing the doorbell ringing.

				KATE
		...excuse me.

	Sam muttering something in Darien's ear of an intimate
	nature. She glides away with him.

				DARIEN
			(to Bud)
		Call me next week, I'll give you an
		estimate...

	An ironic promise in her eyes... Bud ecstatic inside...
	looks over, goes to the foyer...

	INT. GEKKO ALCOVE - NIGHT (RAIN)

	SIR LARRY WILDMAN walks in, his country gentleman clothing
	somewhat softening his imposing figure but not the cultured
	rapacious eagle's face. With him a lawyer.

				KATE
			(strained)
		Larry, how have you been? Get you a
		drink?

				WILDMAN
			(slightly impatient)
		Oh fine. Travelling actually.
		Nothing thank you. Is...

				KATE
		Gordon?... He's right here.

	As Gordon intersects, casually tasting a spot of the dinner.

				GEKKO
		Larry! Excuse me "sir" Larry, great
		to see you again, you're looking
		good.
			(handshakes)


				WILDMAN
		Gordon...
			(sniffing the guests
			and furnishings in
			the room as if they
			were stale air)


				BUD
			(leaving, to Gordon)
		I guess I'll head back...
	 
			GEKKO
			(spontaneously)
		Stick around... Larry, one of my
		"gang" -- Bud Fox.

	Pleasantries. Bud nervously shakes hands, sensing Wildman
	might recognize him from being tailed in the elevator. There
	indeed is a moment but Wildman's attention blurs as...

				GEKKO
		Shall we go upstairs?

	INT. GEKKO DEN - NIGHT (RAIN)

	Gordon enters a den lined with old books hunting prints;  he
	proudly picks up something from his gun collection.

				GEKKO
		Rarest pistol in the world, Larry,
		a .45 Luger. Only six were ever
		manufactured.

				WILDMAN
		Congratulations but rarer still is
		your interest in Anacott Steel.

				GEKKO
		The same interest as yours Larry.
		Money. I thought it'd be a good
		investment for my kid...

				WILDMAN
		No. This time I'm in for the long
		term. This is not a liquidation,
		Gordon. I'm going to turn it around.
		You're getting a free ride on my
		tail, mate, and with the dollars
		you're costing me to buy back the
		stock, I could modernize the plant.
		I'm not the only one who pays here
		Gordon. We're talking about lives
		and jobs; three and four generations
		of steel workers...

	A strong hint of the cockney working class east and London
	boy whiffing through his speech and manner. The "mate" is
	tough and to the point but not insulting...

				GEKKO
			(has to smile)
		You must be wearing a mask you're
		laughing so hard behind it Larry.
		Let's cut the "sir" crap. Correct
		me if I'm wrong, but when you took
		CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000
		workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000,
		that airline...

				WILDMAN
			(cold, deliberate)
		I could break you, mate, in two
		pieces over my knees, you know it,
		I know it, I could buy you six
		times ever, I could dump the stock
		just to burn your ass but I happen
		to want the company and I want your
		block of shares. I'm announcing a
		tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and
		I'm expecting your commitment.

	Bud watching this drama unfold. Gekko is about to blow,
	controls it.

				GEKKO
		Showdowns bore me Larry, neither
		side wins. You can have the
		company, in fact it's gonna be fun
		watching you and your giant ego try
		to make a horserace out of it...
			(turns to Bud)
		What do you think is a fair price
		for our stock Bud?

	Bud in the spotlight. The eyes all shift to him -- his
	moment. After an initial panic, he's cool as a cucumber --
	and ruthless as his mentor.

				BUD
		The break up value is higher. It's
		worth 80.

				GEKKO
		But we don't want to be greedy now,
		so let's let him have it at $72.

	His eyes to Wildman who looks at him, cold, icy mean.

				WILDMAN
		You're a two bit pirate and a
		green-mailer, Gekko, nothing more...
		not only would you sell your mother
		to make a deal, you'd send her COD...

	Bud looking sharply as Gekko's eyes flare with hot white anger.

				GEKKO
		My mail's the same color as yours
		Larry. Or it was till the Queen
		started calling you "sir". Now
		excuse me before I lose my temper...

	He rises and exits.

				WILDMAN
		$71...

	Gekko stops at the door, a beat.

				GEKKO
		Considering you brought my mother
		into it, $71.50.

				WILDMAN
		Done. You'll hear from my lawyers.
		8 a.m. Good night.

	He walks out with the silent lawyer. Past Gekko who watches.
	"Ta Ta".

				GEKKO
			(to Bud)
		He's right. I had to sell. The key
		to the game is your capital
		reserves. You don't have enough,
		you can't pee in the tall weeds
		with the big dogs.

				BUD
			(mimicking Gordon now)
		"All warfare is based on
		deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your
		enemy is superior, evade him, if
		angry, irritate him, if equally
		matched, fight... if not, split and
		reevaluate.

				GEKKO
		You're learning, sport...

	INT. BUD'S APARTMENT - PRE-DAWN

	Exhausted from the drive back, Bud takes off his sweater and
	tie and collapses onto the bed, closing his eyes. The phone
	rings. With a start he wakes and answers it.

				BUD
		Yeah?...

						INTERCUT TO:

	EXT. GEKKO'S BEACH HOUSE - DAWN

	The sky is still dark, the first rays of light coming up
	over the ocean. Gekko, a lonely figure in a windbreaker,
	restlessly prowls the edge of the beach, waves crashing
	around him. He's been up all night and has an exhausted,
	driven look as he whispers over the wind into the cellular
	phone...

				GEKKO
		Money never sleeps pal. When I came
		in in '69, they traded six hours a
		day, now the clock don't stop,
		London's deregulated, the Orient is
		hungrier than us. Just let the
		money circle the world, sport,
		buying and selling, and if you're
		smart it comes back paying. I just
		made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold.
		It's been wired to you -- play with
		it. You done good, but you gotta
		keep doing good. I showed you how
		the game works, now school's out.

				BUD
			(protests)
		Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.

				GEKKO
		You don't understand. I want to be
		surprised...astonish me, sport, new
		info, don't care where or how you
		get it, just get it... My wife
		tells me you put a move on Darien.
		Here's some inside info for you.
		That Euroflash GQ guy she's going
		with's got big bucks but he's
		putting her feet to sleep. Exit
		visas are imminent. So don't lose
		your place in line.
			(gazing at the surf)
		Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this.
		The lights coming up over the water.
		I've never seen a painting that
		captures the beauty of the ocean at
		this moment.
			(suddenly fatigued)
		...an old Russian proverb - "a
		fisherman always sees another
		fisherman from afar." I like you
		sport, I ever tell you that...
		Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.

				BUD
			(off)
		...Gordon.

				GEKKO
		Yeah, I'm gonna make you rich, Bud
		Fox. I'm gonna make you rich enough
		you can afford a girl like Darien.
		Remember, power is the best
		aphrodisiac. This is your wake-up
		call. Go to work.

	He lets the phone drop to his side, staring glazed-eyed at
	the ocean.

	INT. ROGER BARNES' OFFICE - EARLY EVENING

	A SECRETARY leads Bud into the plush, private office of a
	cocky young lawyer, ROGER BARNES, about tho same age as Bud,
	his his feet up on the desk, sleepily waving to Buddy to
	park his ass... The pictures an his walls and desk indicate
	a rich family.

				ROGER
		Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has
		it really been a year. You're not
		hitting me up for NYU are you?

				BUD
		Well we're thinking of putting up a
		statue of you in the subway. I hear
		you're moving up in the world. An
		associate already. Not bad. How's
		Margie?

				ROGER
		Can't complain. Got a house in
		Oyster Bay. Market treating you
		good? Still seeing that sexy French
		gal?

				BUD
		Nah, she asked the wrong question.

				ROGER
		What was that?

				BUD
		"What are you thinking?"...that was
		it. The hours are hell, but the
		money's starting to tumble in. I
		know this guy who's got an iron-
		clad way to make money, I can't
		lose and I can't get hurt.

				ROGER
			(interested)
		So, does "this guy" have a tip for
		an honest lawyer?

				BUD
		Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's
		still not over.

				ROGER
		Okay.

				BUD
		What about you, I hear you guys are
		handling the Fairchild Foods merger
		and it may not be going through.
		Any surprises I haven't read about
		in the Wall Street Journal?

				ROGER
			(casually)
		Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to
		got me disbarred now would you?

				BUD
			(equally casual,
			looks at the walls)
		Who's listening? It's just one
		college buddy talking to another.

				ROGER
			(sarcastic)
		Yeah, right...

				BUD
		Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it
		but you don't know, you don't know.

				ROGER
		...and if I did, what's in it for moi?

	He obviously has thought about it before. Bud smiles back,
	nonchalant.

				BUD
		More money than you ever dreamed,
		Roger. And the thing is no one gets
		hurt...how bout a beer?

				ROGER
			(some doubt)
		Too much to do...but I'll walk you
		out.

	INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ROGER BARNES' OFFICE - EVENING

	They walk out past the CLEANING CREWS coming in for the
	evening, drones of the vacuum cleaners...

	Bud looks - his POV... A CLEANING WOMAN as she pulls the
	vacuum cleaner into one of the senior partners offices, the
	desk crammed with proposals, Bud is lost in thought.

				ROGER
			(teasing)
		...Get inside my uncle's door
		Buddy, all the secrets of the world
		are yours... the life blood of
		companies, but you gotta go to law
		school first...

	EXT. BARNES' OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

	Bud comes out of the building and starts walking away. As he
	passes the freight entrance, Bud abruptly notices a van
	marked MARSALA MAINTENENCE COMPANY. He looks back, thinks
	for a moment: a look in his eyes.

	EXT. LONG ISLAND CITY - LIGHT INDUSTRIAL PARK - DAY

	Bud walks past a row of small warehouses and enters one.

	INT. MARSALA MAINTENANCE OFFICE AND GARAGE SERVICE - DAY

	He steps into a shabby reception area. A chain-smoking OLD
	LADY looks up from the switch-board.

				BUD
		I need to speak to the owner about
		some business.

	INT. BACK OFFICE - DAY

	The owner, a GREEK with bushy mustache and hardened face,
	sits at his desk eating lunch, eyeing Bud suspiciously.

				BUD
			(handing him a card)
		Mr. Panos, I've charted the growth
		of new office space in the city,
		and I think you're in the right
		business at the right time.

				PANOS
		Thank you for telling me what I
		already know.

				BUD
		I'm impressed with your work and I
		could use a tax break. This is a
		growing business. Are you interested
		in some working capital and a partner?

	Panos puts down his sandwich, measuring Bud.

				PANOS
		What makes you think I need a
		partner?!

	Bud smiles, ready with his spiel.

	An elevator opens. A body steps out. A set of keys. Boom up
	past a clipboard and pen to a shirt pocket with MARSALA
	MAINTENANCE written on it, up to Bud dressed in janitorial
	clothing.

	We move with him to the CREW SUPERVISOR who introduces THREE
	CLEANING WOMEN who nervously absorb Bud, worried for their
	jobs.

	Bud strolls from office to office, looking official,
	overseeing his crew, making notations on a checklist.

	Bud slips into the Senior Partners' office, thumbs through a
	calendar on the desk. Sees the list of people, moves to the
	computer, punches the client's name in. The code number
	comes up.

	Bud nods to a SECURITY GUARD down the hall and enters the
	file room where he looks at the Cleaning Lady and points to
	his watch. As she exits, he scrambles nervously through the
	files -- finds the code number -- then anxiously flips the
	pages to the critical tender offer document -- with the
	target name -- INVESTMENT IN RORKER ELECTRONICS CORP. It's
	stamped "DRAFT" across the page. His face lights up. The
	secret to the kingdom. He puts it back, exits.

						WIPE TO:

	INT. GEKKO'S OFFICE - DAY

	Gekko on the phone, smiling.

	INT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

	Bud, obviously exhausted from his day and night roles, is
	telling him something on the phone.

	INT. SECOND LAW FIRM - NIGHT

	Bud furtively xeroxes a document on a small hand-carried
	copy machine in his pocket or photographs it if it is too
	large.

	INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

	Bud and Alex, Gekko's assistant, having lunch. Alex gives
	him the briefcase he's carrying. Pan from Alex to Bud back
	to discover Darien in the next scene.

	INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

	Bud dines with Darien, small talk, intimate looks.

	INT. THIRD LAW FIRM - NIGHT

	Bud is in an office, eyes panning the shelves.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Can I help you?

	Bud's head jerks around. A young female PARALEGAL is burning
	the midnight oil. She looks at him from behind a stack of
	briefs.

				BUD
			(backing off)
		Uh. Wrong office. Sorry...

	EXT. BRIDGEHAMPTON BEACH - DAY

	Gekko, Kate, Bud, Darien and A FIFTH PERSON roar over the
	dunes, each in their own dune buggy, laughing and hollering
	at one another...

	Buddy driving right up precariously close on Darien, who
	screams... Buddy flips over his vehicle... comes up
	laughing... we sense he is getting wilder now...

	EXT. HORSE FARM - BRIDGEHAMPTON - DAY

	Darien rides expertly. A beautiful, immaculately-groomed
	stallion is being shown to Gekko by the trainer.

	Bud is sipping wine as he looks on with Kate.

				GEKKO
			(proudly)
		Got him at an auction in Kentucky.

				BUD
		How much?

				GEKKO
			(fondling the head)
		Close to two million.
			(Bud whistles)
		But this sucker can go all the way
		to Devon and the nationals.

	Darien rides in, smiling to Bud.

				BUD
		Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew.
		What about the Triple Crown?

				DARIEN
		He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a
		jumper.

				BUD
		How would I know? I once bet a
		horse. He went out at ten to one
		and came in at quarter to five.

	He laughs, a little sloppy.

	EXT. OCEAN - DAY

	Darien swims in the ocean, long looping athletic strokes.

	EXT. POOL AND PATIO - GEKKO'S BRIDGEHAMPTON HOUSE - DAY

	They're finishing lunch by the pool framed by a lush flower
	garden where Kate and son Rudy play. HAROLD SALT, Gekko's
	chief lawyer, thick glasses, smart eyes and bags of worry
	that could only come from watching other people's money,
	looks very city-like in his clothing, examining his
	paperwork before passing it to Bud, who is the picture of
	relaxation.

				HAROLD
		...You understand Mr. Gekko is
		constantly barraged with nuisance
		litigation and IRS audits.

				BUD
			(nods)
		Of course.

				HAROLD
		...So it's in both our interests to
		put a safe distance between you and
		us...
			(passing a document
			with a 2nd pen)
		...this gives you limited power of
		attorney for Mr. Gekko's account.
		Every trade you make is at your
		discretion. Every ticket you buy
		must be marked "power of attorney."
		That means you call the shots and
		Mr. Gekko has no official knowledge
		of what stocks you're buying. Sign
		here and here...

	Buddy looks, then up to Gekko, who smiles, casual.

				GEKKO
		...just the beginning, sport, just
		the begining...

	Bud smiles, signs.

				HAROLD
			(a worrier)
		...you understand if any problems
		arise, you're out there on your own.
		The trail stops with you...

				BUD
		All's fair in love and war.

				GEKKO
		The art of which is deception.
		Spread the buy orders through
		different accounts and you won't
		get burned...

				BUD
		I think I got some friends that
		won't mind making some easy money...

	As Kate drifts over with Rudy and the French au pair GIRL,
	NICOLE.

				GEKKO
		Rudy, viens ici, dit bonjour a
		Monsieur Bud.

	Rudy either says "No!" or "Bonjour Monsieur Bud!' depending
	on the mood of the kid. Gordon sweeping him up and playing
	with him. The kid squeals with glee.

				GEKKO
			(proudly)
		Already speaks a little French, kid
		got the highest score on his IQ test.

				KATE
			(to Darien)
		...it's so tough to get into a good
		nursery school now. They even visit
		your home to make sure your
		paintings and furnishings are
		acceptable.

				BUD
		What's it cost these days?

				KATE
		$5,000 just for the tuition... plus
		the books and supplies...
			(with a look to Gordon)
		...some parents even have bodyguards.
		It's not a bad idea...
			(picking up Rudy)
		...now that's it for you with the
		grown-ups young man.

	As Rudy smashes the strawberries around his face and resists
	going. "No! No!" Kate exasperated gives the child to Nicole.

				KATE
		Nicole, take him for a nap, please.

				NICOLE
		He doesn't nap anymore, Madame.
		It's been...

				KATE
			(stung)
		Then play with him till he gets
		tired. We're going out tonight but
		we like to see him at, let's see,
		six; give him a bath and put that
		cute little black suit on him...
			(to Bud and Gordon)
		Black clothes are the newest
		things, so chic and milk stains,
		carrot juice stains just don't show
		up. Kids -- boy, can they take it
		out of you!

	Nicole's "Oui, Madame" is lost in the wrestling match she
	goes through to drag him out screaming. Kate walking off.
	Harold gives Buddy another piece of paper...

				HAROLD
		This is a contact at one of our
		banks. On settlement day you'll
		open an account there for Mr. Gekko
		under the name of Geneva, Roth
		Holding Corp. Then you'll wire
		transfer the money to this account
		in the Cayman Islands...

				GEKKO
			(rising, finished
			with lunch)
		Think about incorporating yourself
		there, Bud, Harold will take care
		of it for you.
			(with a look to Harold)
		... at a reasonable fee. You're
		gonna make a lot of money now Bud...
		stakes are gonna go up, no mistakes...

				BUD
		...piece of cake, Gordon...

	EXT. BEACHFRONT - DAY

	The camera glides off some FISHERMEN hauling their catch off
	their beached boat to Darien who comes tromping out of the
	surf, water glistening off her lean athletic body. Bud
	stands before her, cool seductive eyes, holding out a towel.
	She steps up to him and smiles inscrutably. Takes the towel
	from him, drying herself, instead.

				DARIEN
			(gazing at the beach)
		If I could have anything... this
		would almost do.

				BUD
		Yeah, almost...

	Looks at her, stifles his thought.

				DARIEN
			(teasing)
		So, how did your conference go with
		Gordon?

				BUD
		The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We
		reached an agreement and decided to
		divide up the world between us.

				DARIEN
			(laughs)
		You have modest wants. I like that
		in a man.

				BUD
		And what do you want?

				DARIEN
		...a Turner, a perfect canary
		diaiaond... a Lear jet... world
		peace... the best of everything...

				BUD
		Well, why stop at that?

				DARIEN
		I don't.

				BUD
			(has to smile)
		You're not trouble by any chance.
		Are you?

	She looks at him, tosses the towel over her shoulder and
	starts back toward the house. Buddy watches her go.

	INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY

	The annual Teldar Paper stockholders' meeting is in session:
	400 stockholders are there -- many middle aged and older,
	one bag lady. Cromwell sits on an elevated platform at the
	front of the room surrounded by an army of bulky EXECUTIVES,
	none of them weighing less than 200 pounds, ACCOUNTANTS and
	LAWYERS. Gekko in contrast seems like Robin Hood seated with
	Alex, Harold, Bud and the other stockholders. Cromwell is
	delivering his prepared attack on Gekko in a highly
	sarcastic, gruff manner.

				CROMWELL
		...Your company, ladies and
		gentlemen, is under siege from
		Gordon Gekko.
		Teldar Paper is now leveraged to
		the hilt, like some piss poor South
		American country...instead of using
		our cash to build plants, build our
		business, all this man really wants
		is to get paid to withdraw his
		tender offer and that will cost us
		approximately another $200 million
		in greenmail which will be passed
		on to the consumer...

	Gekko seething, jumps up.

				GEKKO
		Where do you get off speaking about
		me like that, making remarks to the
		press, I resent these remarks, I
		demand the right to speak.

				CROMWELL
		Sit down, sir, you're out of order,
		haven't you done enough damage to
		Teldar as it is?...have you no
		sense of decency?
			(to shareholders)
		How can your management...

	Gekko is urged to sit down by his people but we hear various
	catcalls, "Let the man speak!" "Sit down, Gekko!"

				CROMWELL (CONT'D)
		...concentrate on long term growth
		when we're busy fighting the get-
		rich-quick, short term profit, slot
		machine mentality of Wall Street
		when we should be fighting Japan!
		The original fundamental reason for
		Wall Street was to capitalize
		American business, underwrite new
		business, build companies, build
		America. The "deal" has now
		succeeded goods and services as
		America's gross national product
		and in the process, we are
		undermining our foundation. This
		cancer is called "greed". Greed and
		speculation have replaced long-term
		investment. Corporations are being
		taken apart like erector sets,
		without any consideration of the
		public good. I strongly recommend
		you to see through Mr. Gekko's
		shameless intention here to
		strip this company and severely
		penalize the stockholders. I
		strongly recommend you to reject
		his tender by voting for
		management's restructuring of the
		stock.

						CUT TO:

	Gekko is now at floor level with a microphone. He's calmer,
	makes his pitch to the stockholders, looking up at the
	management.

				GEKKO
		...I appreciate the chance you're
		giving me, Mr. Cromwell, as the
		single largest stockholder in
		Teldar, to speak.
			(gets some laughter
			and applause, loosens)
		On the way here today I saw a
		bumper sticker. It said, "Life is a
		bitch... then you die".
			(gets another laugh)
		...well ladies and gentlemen, we're
		not here to indulge in fantasies,
		but in political and economic
		reality. America has become a
		second rate power. Our trade
		deficit and fiscal deficit are at
		nightmare proportions. In the days
		of the 'free market' when our
		country was a top industrial power,
		there was accountability to the
		shareholders. The Carnegies, the
		Mellons, the man who built this
		industrial empire, made sure of it
		because it was their money at stake.
		Today management has no stake in
		the company. Altogether these guys
		sitting up there own a total of
		less than 3% and where does Mr.
		Cromwell put his million dollar
		salary? Certainly not in Teldar
		stock, he owns less than 1%.
		You own Teldar Paper, the
		stockholders, and you are being
		royally screwed over by these
		bureaucrats with their steak
		lunches, golf and hunting trips,
		corporate jets, and golden
		parachutes! Teldar Paper has 33
		different vice presidents each
		earning over $200,000 a year. I
		spent two months analyzing what
		these guys did and I still can't
		figure it out.
			(a big laugh)


	Cromwell is pissed.

				CROMWELL
		This is an outrage Gekko! You're
		full of shit!

				GEKKO
		One thing I do know is this paper
		company lost $110 million last
		year, and I'd bet half of that is
		in the paperwork going back and
		forth between all the vice
		presidents...
			(increased laughter,
			he's getting them)
		The new law of evolution in
		corporate America seems to be
		'survival of the unfittest'. Well
		in my book, you either do it right
		or you get eliminated. Teldar Paper
		is doomed to fail. Its
		diversification into casualty
		insurance has not worked. Its crown
		jewels are its trees, the rest is
		dross. Through wars, depressions,
		inflations and deterioration of
		paper money, trees have always kept
		their value, but Teldar is chopping
		them all down. Forests are
		perishable, forest rights are as
		important as human rights to this
		planet, and all the illusory
		Maginot lines, scorched earth
		tactics, proxy fights, poison
		pills, etc. that Mr.
		Cromwell is going to come up with
		to prevent people like me from
		buying Teldar Paper are doomed to
		fail because the bottom line,
		ladies and gentlemen, as you very
		well know, is the only way to stay
		strong is to create value, that's
		why you buy stock, to have it go up.
		If there's any other reason, I've
		never hear it.
			(laughter)
		That's all I'm saying...it's you
		people who own this company, not
		them, they work for you and they've
		done a lousy job of it. Get rid of
		them fast, before you all get sick
		and die. I may be an opportunist,
		but if these clowns did a better
		job, I'd be out of work. In the
		last seven deals I've been in,
		there were 2.3 million stockholders
		that actually made a pretax profit
		of $12 billion. When I bought the
		Ixtlan Corporation it was in the
		exact same position Teldar is
		today -- I turned three of its
		companies private and I sold four
		others -- and each of these
		companies, liberated from the
		suffering conglomerate has
		prospered. I am not a destroyer of
		companies, I am a liberator of them.
		The point is, ladies and gentlemen,
		greed is good. Greed works, greed
		is right. Greed clarifies, cuts
		through, and captures the essence
		of the evolutionary spirit. Greed
		in all its forms, greed for life,
		money, love, knowledge, has marked
		the upward surge of mankind -- and
		greed, mark my words -- will save
		not only Teldar Paper but that
		other malfunctioning corporation
		called the USA...Thank you.

	Much applause as he sits. Now a standing ovation; shouts of
	approval. Cromwell knows he has lost the day, tries to
	continue the meeting by calling for "order".

	Bud watches, impressed.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	BROKERS mill at their desks quietly. Bud enters, notices
	immediately the uneasy silence. His eyes go to Lynch's
	office... across the windows, he's talking to a very somber
	Dan Steeples.

				BUD
		What's going on?

				MARV
			(looking in the same direction)
		Lynch is giving him the boot...
		He's not pulling his quota.

	Bud's soft "no" matched by that second, tighter look. His
	POV -- closer on the glass... Dan Steeples pleading for his
	job... we know the things he's saying, we've heard them
	before... just one more chance, Mr. Lynch... Lynch shaking
	his head...

				MARV
			(reminding him)
		...we're all just one trade away
		from humility, Buddy...

	Dan Steeples steps out of the office, obviously close to
	tears but trying to maintain face... Buddy's eyes dart away,
	not wanting to deal with it. Dan Steeples walks by his as
	Lynch, on the loudspeaker, starts his morning announcements.

				LYNCH
		New research report on GM and a
		conference call on defense stocks
		at my office at 11. No RSVP
		required, just be there. And on an
		inspiring note I'm pleased to
		announce the new office record for
		a single month's gross commission
		goes to Bud Fox. Who more than
		doubled the old mark. Way to go Bud.
		Super job! Come on up here.

	As Dan Rickey passes him during this, Bud catches a glimpse
	of the older man's eyes. Dan tries to look brave. Heads
	turning to Bud with awe and envy...

				MARV
		Congrats buddy buddy, you just made
		my life twice as hard around here...

	Bud moving toward Lynch, past Lou Mannheim.

				MANNHEIM
		You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it
		while it lasts -- 'cause it never
		does.

				BUD
			(cocky)
		...just kickin' ass and taking
		names, Mr. Mannheim.

	Bud passes Charlie Cushing, yawning on the phone as usual.

				CHARLIE
		So whaddaya say pal, wanna play
		some doubles at Piping? Meet the
		membership? I got a little blonde
		named Mandy, about nineteen, avec
		cafe au lait boobs... she's mine
		but she's got a cousin who has
		great muffins.

				BUD
		...sounds dubious Chuck, but Piping
		Rock any day.

	Chuck laughs, Bud's "in" now. Lynch indicates for Bud to
	follow him into an outer glass-enclosed office.

				LYNCH
		Come in, Bud...

	INT. BUD'S NEW OFFICE - DAY

	Neatly furnished, with a window overlooking Wall Street, and
	attractive CHINESE SECRETARY filing papers into a cabinet.

				LYNCH
			(points)
		Congratulations. This is yours
		now... your own file cabinets... a
		window ... your private secretary,
		Janet,
			(under his breath)
		significantly more attractive.

				JANET
		Nice to meet you, Mr. Fox.

	She smiles at Bud, who heaves a sigh of relief, noticing his
	name plate on the desk.

				BUD
			(thrilled)
		Thank you, Janet...thank you, Mr.
		Lynch.

				LYNCH
		No, thank you. I knew the minute I
		laid eyes on you, you had what it
		takes Bud. Just keep it going.

	He winks and leaves. Charlie Cushing comes in, Marv sticks
	his head in the doorway, a grudging smile.

				MARV
		So, its Mister Fox now.

	INT. CONDOMINIUM APARTMENT - UPPER EAST SIDE - DAY

	A splendid four-room thirtieth floor aerie overlooking
	Central Park. SYLVIE DRIMMER, anchored down with jewelry and
	a large fur purse, shows Bud around.

				SYLVIE
		...everybody tells ya they hate the
		Upper East Side and they wanna live
		on the West Side but honey when it
		comes to resale time, believe me
		the East Side's the one that always
		moves. What do you get on the West
		Side?
			(contemptuously)
		Madonna and Sean?... between Sly
		and Billy and Christie, I've shown
		every apartment on the Upper East
		Side. Everybody lives here... Mick,
		Gloria and Barbara Wa-Wa. Even
		Klaus von Bulow buys his fresh
		fruit from the Korean on Madison.
		It's so expensive and it's just
		like the ones on Eighth Avenue but
		it's an attitude is all, you pay
		for attitude
			(pointing to a walk-
			in closet)
		...two walk-in closets...upstairs
		on the roof you lot a health
		club...massage, sauna, jacuzzi,
		sunlights, best schools in the
		city, cute boy like you gotta think
		of a ladyfriend when you're
		finished wolfing around --
			('course I'm taken)
		...oak strip floor...my husband can
		get you a 10% mortgage...I'd do it
		myself if we weren't into four
		other deals already...so?...
			(beat)
		I got a four o'clock and a
		five...one of them's an all-cash
		type, Monique something or
		other...I guarantee you this place
		is history tomorrow...

	Bud looks around. The city at his feet. Lost in thought.
	Sylvie has to call him out of it: "honey? -- The meter's
	running. Anybody home?"

				BUD
		All right. Offer 950...

	Sylvie tries to play it cool, her expression conveying a
	somewhat stunned look at the speed and certainty of the
	response.

				SYLVIE
		...I think you gotta deal, honey...
		you sure you don't wanna see
		somethin' I got on Sutton Place.
		It's a million and a half but...

				BUD
		Nah...this is it..home...

	Looking it over, proud.

	INTERIOR DECORATING MONTAGE

	The music is geared to speed, money, triumph and just plain
	material fun.

	INT. BUD'S CONDO - DAY/NIGHT

	In its first stage, Darien supervising. It's expanse of
	white walls devoid of mouldings, a blank plaster canvas. The
	city views are great, the apartment identical to hundreds of
	other cookie cutter condos. Several young artists are
	working on a neo-classical mural on the long side of the
	living room. They are colorfully dressed, listening to a
	TALKING HEADS tape while they work. A carpenter who looks
	like a member of Duran Duran is installing a pair of old
	columns from Urban Archaeology on either side of the
	entrance to the living room while another fits a brass sink
	into an antique sideboard which has been turned into a bar.

	INT. BUD'S CONDO - DAY/NIGHT

	INTERIOR DECORATING MONTAGE - SECOND STAGE

	Living room furniture arrives. A fantail shrimp chaise from
	Art Furniture's "Sushi Collection" arrives, along with an
	enormous sofa encased in an ecru linen slipcover made
	deliberately baggy and tied on with rows of self bows on
	each end, several faux Etruscan pots wired up as lamps, a
	poured concrete coffee table that looks like it came from
	Pompeii, and a hand-painted floor cloth instead of a rug for
	the bleached floor with the stencilled border... Darien
	sitting in a fantastical adirondack chair made from gnarled
	branches, amused by Bud's reactions to the furniture.

	THIRD STAGE. The kitchen has the latest compact computer
	dishwasher and compact microwave, garbage compactor, and
	sinks with infrared controls... A brief food montage gives
	us a sense of the modernist approach to food and its
	preparation:

	1) Darien hones the knives on the electric knife sharpener as

	2) Bud uses a stainless steel Cape Cod oyster opener to work
	on two dozen oysters...

	3) at the same time working on the automatic vinaigrette
	mixer, the phone ringing to the tune of Mozart's "Jupiter"...

				BUD
			(picking it up)
		Yes...no...at 37 1/2. Convert the
		bonds right...and check the price
		in Tokyo at 8:00 LA time. Thanks...

	4) As he starts his pasta sauce flame an his O'Reilly fat-
	free grill with a flexible neck fire starter...

	5) A freshly heated roll pops out of a hanging space-saving
	toaster, as Darien works the electric pasta maker while
	melting the frozen ice cream cartons in the microwave.

	6) Bud manages to sneak a kiss an her lips humming the bars
	from Verdi's "Rigoletto" as he works the piece de la
	resistance--the automatic sushi maker...

	7) Dinner is finally served on a demolished dinner table.
	Red wine, pasta, sushi...it looks perfect, lit by
	candlelight, the view of the city below.

				DARIEN
		...isn't it perfect!

				BUD
		...too perfect...let's not even eat.
		Let's just watch it and think about
		it.
			(pause)

	FOURTH STAGE - INT. BUD'S CONDO - DAY

	Bud goes over a stack of bills with something approaching
	concern as the gothic oak refectory table which seats 20 is
	carried in, followed by a Jean Michel Basquiat featuring a
	skull on a rough board. Darien instructs the movers to place
	an important pair of satinwood Art Deco armchairs upholstered
	in buttery suede (last Saturday's auction purchase for
	$20,000) at either end of the titanic sofa. No vestige is
	left of the cookie cutter space we first saw. Walls have
	been removed, mouldings and architectural found objects
	added, imitation rare woods, marbles and frescos have been
	created from nothing by the magic hands of the tromp l'oeil
	crew. The point is, decorating can transform.

	INT. CONDO - NIGHT

	The look of the place is evocative of ancient times, yet
	sumptuous. Darien and Bud sink into the bales of down in the
	sofa and are dwarfed. She rests her head on a hand stencilled
	velvet Venetian throw pillow, looking like a Pre-Raphaelite
	madonna. A terracotta pot with a spray of white phaleonopsis
	graces the coffee table. As the sun sets over the canyons of
	highrises, Bud walks around his new home totally in awe.
	This apartment, perfect in its restrained taste with all the
	"correct" flowers and objects, has nothing to do with him.
	Perhaps he can understand the state-of-the-art kitchen, the
	computerized telephone, stereo and light system, but he
	needs a set of instructions just to be able to switch on
	David Letterman.

	This apartment is Darien's fantasy, and Bud is merely the
	incidental client who paid for it. Most importantly to her,
	it is ready to be photographed by House and Garden.

				BUD
			(dubiously looking at
			a rough plaster wall
			of fading fresco)
		You know, the elevator man couldn't
		believe I paid $300,000 to have my
		walls looking like this, he's got
		them for free in Brooklyn.

				DARIEN
		I'll bet he's got an opinion on the
		stock market too. This apartment is
		already ahead of its time. I call
		it the "demolished" look. They've
		already heard about it at House and
		Garden and they're coming next week
		to photograph it before it gets...
		lived in. Is that alright? I'd love
		to have it in my portfolio.

				BUD
		Sure... But your fee... considering
		you're way over budget, should be
		negotiable.

	As he nuzzles her neck, she feels threatened, stops.

				DARIEN
		Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm
		not going to take a cut. I worked
		hard and you can't decorate a room
		in New York for less than $100,000.
		Curtains alone...

				BUD
		I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're
		still young, Darien. So what's
		money anyway when everybody's
		making it, it's all relative. After
		all, this is not the house in
		Connecticut, this is just a crash
		pad good for a couple of
		years...before we slip our two
		lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie
		into the Lycee Francaise.

				DARIEN
		You got it all charted out don't
		you, like a stock projection.
	 
			BUD
		That's right -- one with high
		yield, rich assets and no downside...

	As the kiss grows, his hands move into her nether regions.
	She looks at him, sober.

				DARIEN
		Do you think you're ready?

				BUD
		It's not me I'm worried about...You
		know Darien, the only reason we
		haven't slept together is because
		we both know we will -- and not
		knowing when was the only surprise
		left. You owe me, I want you, what
		else is there...but you, me, the
		world.
			(he folds back her
			palms in his)
		...right here...make love to
		me...now...
			(more kissing)
		Stop me if I'm going too far.

				DARIEN
		I'll let you know.

	INT. BUD'S CONDO - BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Bud making love to Darien. Camara closing on them.

	Her face -- from his point of view. Her smile.

	His face -- looking down. Covered with sweat and passion.

				BUD
		Is this real? Is this really real?

	EXT. BUD'S CONDO - TERRACE - NIGHT

	Bud walks out alone in his blue bathrobe on his parapet
	overlooking Central Park. The wind stirs his hair. The East
	and West sides of the park wrap the city in a diamond
	necklace of brilliant light.

	Bud stares down at the world. He has it all now. The money.
	The girl. The magic palace apartment. What more is there?
	Something...because Bud suddenly throws a wrenching
	dislocated look into himself that makes us wonder as he
	brushes his hand across his face and mutters to himself.

				BUD
		Who am I?

	There is no ready answer. As he finally turns and goes back
	inside and closes the door.

	INT. BUD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Darien lies curled in the bed, eyes open, looking at him.

				DARIEN
		Come to bed, Bud...

	EXT. PHONE BOOTH - SOUTH STREET SEAPORT - TWILIGHT

	Cocktail hour in the background, yuppies trying to score for
	the weekend. Bud on the phone, strained look transforming to
	a bright, upbeat personality as the phone is answered.

				BUD
		Dixon! It's your lucky day! That's
		right. I want to give you some
		stock and you don't have to put up
		a penny...

						INTERCUT:

	EXT. CABIN - ASPEN COLORADO - DAY

	A small cabin in the mountains.

	INT. CABIN - ASPEN COLORADO - DAY

	Whole earth furnishings. DIXON, a long-haired ski bum
	dropout listens skeptically.

				DIXON
		Sure, and I'm never gonna die
		either, is this one of your chain
		letter schemes or do I gotta buy a
		door to door cosmetic franchise in
		Northern Arkansas?

	EXT. PHONE BOOTH - SOUTH STREET SEAPORT - TWILIGHT

				BUD
		No, no Dixon, my client wants to
		buy a large, large block of stock
		and needs to spread it around. I'll
		park some money in your account and
		if it hits, you get a big cut. I'm
		telling you, this is the easiest
		money you ever made...

	INT. ROGER BARNES' OFFICE - DAY

	Roger listens on the phone.

				BUD
			(off)
		...and you don't have to put up a
		dime, Roger.

				ROGER
			(tentatively)
		All right, Bud... let's do it.

	A look on his face. As if he knows he's making a fatal mistake.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

				BUD
			(on the phone)
		...it's easy Jack! On settlement
		day, you endorse a check to Blue
		Horseshoe Trading Company. Then I
		send you your cut.

	Marv waves across the glass partition and knocks. But Bud
	waves him off, closing the blinds.

				BUD (CONT'D)
		...that's the bottom line. And
		nobody gets hurt.

	Marv now walks it, exasperated.

				MARV
		...things are so bad, even the
		liars are complaining. And you're
		making money. So what gives? What's
		the bottom line?

	As he tries to peak at Bud's quotron screen, but Bud flicks
	it off, pissed.

				BUD
		Hey, I'm tired of playing nurse to
		you all the time, alright. Do your
		own home work!

	Marvin abruptly walks out, "asshole!". Bud books the order
	for Morning Star Corp -- MSC -- 50,000 June options.

	INT. AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE - LATER THAT DAY

	The COMPANY FLOOR MANAGER gets Bud's order, hands a ticket
	to a RUNNER who dashes off across the exchange floor, and
	over to a TRADER who starts to execute the order.

	CLOSE on the broad tape. As Bud's large buy order flickers
	across it -- MSC -- 50,000 June options.

	INT. AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE - S.E.C. OPTIONS WATCH OFFICE -
	DAY

	A CLERK sits before a computer routinely tracking all of the
	exchange floor trading. He runs a check on a transaction.

	Computer Screen -- The same numbers and letters are seen
	that just flickered across the broad tape... Bud's buy.

	The clerk swivels his chair to a second computer and punches
	up data. A MAN appears behind him, leaning over his
	shoulder, and wears an ID BADGE. The clerk vacates his seat
	to the man with the badge, who now takes over.

	INT. BUD'S CONDO - NIGHT

	Bud is in silk boxers on the phone, number crunching on the
	computer, foot pounding to a music beat on the stereo, while
	his telex spews out overnight currency data.

	Darien in the background lies in bed in panties reading Vogue.

				BUD
			(into the phone)
		Buy me 20 June Euro Dollar CDs.
		Twenty March gold and sell 10
		September Deutsch marks. That's
		right...

	He hangs up, back to the computer a growing look of
	excitement and revelation in his eyes.

	On the computer screen we see a break up Of Bluestar
	Airlines -- its assets and liabilities.

	Bud hits the command key, printing it out. He's exuberant.

				BUD
		Bud, I hate to tell you this but
		you're a genius!
			(to Darien)
		Darien...lightning has struck! The
		lightbulb has been invented.
		Edison, Da Vinci, Einstein are
		watching...

				DARIEN
			(grumpy)
		...are you going to trade all night
		again? You got to go to work in a
		couple of hours.

				BUD
		You think I'm gonna broker the rest
		of my life... I'm going to be a
		giant, Darien, an entrepreneur in
		the Italian 15th century sense of
		the word -- a mover, shaker.

	Bud dances over to the bed turning the stereo down on his way.

				BUD
		I love you, baby. Did I tell you
		that sometime in the last 24 hours?

				DARIEN
		Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the
		sixty hour work week? You're
		turning into a yuppie Frankenstein,
		you love money so much.

	Bud grabs a bottle of Ferrier off the night table and drinks.

				BUD
		Sure, why not, money's the sex of
		the 80's. I never had it like you
		when I was growing up, baby, it
		wasn't the upper east side.

				DARIEN
		You're so naive Bud, you don't even
		know. Your dad took care of you. I
		might've been rich when I was a
		kid...but my father lost all his
		money...in the seventies, in the
		stock market, at the track. He was
		a lousy gambler...

				BUD
			(teasing)
		...that changes all my plans, I
		thought you were loaded...

				DARIEN
			(laughs woefully)
		So did I, till I hit 19 and found I
		had all the royal habits and no
		throne. Mom got by but I had to go
		to work just like you.
		Only the skills I had were shopping
		and making friends. So...that's why
		I do what I do, what makes you
		tick, Buddy?

				BUD
		Fear. The fear of being poor I
		guess, just like you, Darien... But
		that's all gonna change sweetheart.
		I'm catching the express...
			(making love to her)
		... and you're going along for the
		ride.

	INT. GEKKO'S PRIVATE PLANE (GULFSTREAM - 4) - DAY

	A salon interior. Gekko on a couch reading, with eyeglasses,
	a stack of financial reports. Alex is on the phone, Susan,
	and others accompanying the caravan on a business trip. Bud
	is excited.

				BUD
		...Bluestar's an unpolished gem,
		Gordon, right out of the garbage. A
		half assed management being
		decimated by a price war they can't
		win. But the gates at LaGuardia
		alone can bail us out, it's worth
		25 bucks a share if it's worth a
		dime! They're ripe to fall.

	Gekko, the poker player, hasn't seen enough cards.

				GEKKO
		Mixed emotions, Buddy: like Larry
		Wildman going off a cliff in my new
		Maserati. Men as smart as myself
		have got their asses handed to them
		on a sling with the airlines, fuel
		could go up, unions are killers...

				BUD
		Yeah aren't you forgetting
		something Gordon: rule one, capital
		reserves. This company has $75
		million cash in an overfunded
		pension. That buys us a lot of
		credibility...
			(Gordon looks up, interested)
		...and the beauty is you already
		own close to two percent of this
		sucker...

				ALEX
			(interrupting, on the phone)
		Gordon, the insurance people are
		balking on the logging trucks...

				GEKKO
		Tell those spineless toads we'll
		self-insure if they don't write
		it... You fire 33 vice presidents
		and nothing changes...
			(back to Bud)
		You eating twinkies today, Bud, or
		are you schtupping some stewardess...

				BUD
			(deadly serious)
		Gordon what I want--and I never
		asked you for anything--is to be
		your co-pilot on this. I want to
		take this airline, turn it around,
		and make it work. It's gonna make
		us a fortune!

				GEKKO
			(to Susan)
		I'm talking to a stockbroker who
		wants to run an airline. It's gonna
		take me two years and 2000
		headaches to turn Teldar Paper
		around, what do I need this dink
		airline for? I'm up to my ass in
		more nuts than a fruitcake.

				BUD
		Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I
		know my way around, I have friends
		there...inside.

				GEKKO
			(getting the drift)
		What does that mean?

				BUD
			(playing out his ace)
		The three unions. It's 43% of
		Bluestar's operating budget, the
		hourly cost of a flight crew is
		$850 an hour, that's the real
		hidden value G.G., if you can
		negotiate that out, get a crew down
		to $350-400 an hour a run, this
		airline is gonna be the hottest
		thing since Texas Air...

				GEKKO
		What makes you think you can?

				BUD
		I can talk to these people Gordon,
		they trust me...and my father can
		be a big help in getting cuts.

				GEKKO
			(pause)
		Alright... Susan, get Buckingham on
		the box. I want him to look at it.
		And tell Jock Taylor at Thwick,
		Jensen...
			(smiles wickedly,
			back to Bud)
		So sport, the falcon has heard the
		falconer...tell me more...

	INT. BUD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Bud, in high gear, all smiles, expensive Armani suit, opens
	the door. His father stands before him, looking like a man
	on his way to the dentist.

				BUD
		Dad, well come on in. Everybody's
		here. We couldn't start the show
		without you.

	Wide-eyed, Carl follows Bud through the foyer, taking in the
	furnishings, paintings, antiques.

				CARL
			(under his breath)
		Well I'll be a lousy Republican.

				DARIEN
			(overhears him)
		I decorate for Democrats too, lots
		of them.
			(she extends her hand
			and gives him a warm smile)
		I'm Darien Taylor.

				CARL
			(sardonically)
		I know. You're one of the art works
		that go with the apartment.
			(softens a little)
		Pretty creative. Doesn't look
		anything like the place my son
		bought a few months age.

				DARIEN
		Listen, I hope you'll come here
		often, and under less formal
		circumstances.

	Halfway won over Carl enters the living room where Darien
	has set up a table with miniature gourmet pizza, etc. The
	atmosphere is strained, the camps separated. Gekko stands by
	the bar, conferring with his lawyer, Harold Salt. Darien
	walks over to the couch with drinks for the Ixtax Union
	Reps: DUNCAN WILMORE, ALPA Leader, a rugged silver-haired
	uniformed pilot; TONI CARPENTER, AFA Rep, hard looking,
	40ish flight attendant.

				BUD
		Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore,
		pilot's union, and Toni Carpenter,
		flight attendants...

				CARL
		I met them before you were born.

	They exchange nods.

				BUD
		And I'd like to introduce you to Mr.
		Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt.

				GEKKO
		A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox.

	Carl stares at Gekko, sizing him up.

				GEKKO
		I'd be proud to have a son like Bud.
		He's got a great future ahead of him.

	Carl looks to his fellow union representatives, then to Gekko.

				CARL
			(gesturing at Salt)
		I thought this was an informal
		meeting. What's he doing here?

				GEKKO
			(dismissing him)
		Harold, you don't mind strolling
		around the block a couple hundred
		times, do you?

				HAROLD
			(looks at his watch)
		Of course...

	Salt gathers his jacket to leave, as Gekko and Carl eye one
	another, tentatively.

				DARIEN
		...please help yourselves to some
		food...

						CUT TO:

	The food is half consumed. Gekko addresses the union leaders.

				GEKKO
		Look, I have no illusions about
		winning a popularity contest with
		any of you. I was roasted the other
		night, and a friend of mine asked--
		why are we honoring this man--have
		we run out of human beings?

	His joke breaks the ice; they laugh, except for Carl.

				GEKKO (CONT'D)
		It's not always the most popular
		guy who gets the job done. You got
		losses of 20 to 30 million dollars,
		dividends cut to zero, you're
		getting squeezed to death by the
		majors. Present management may not
		be the worst scum of the earth, but
		they're the ones who've put you on
		a kamikaze course, and pretty soon
		everybody's going to be scrambling
		for the parachutes. Only there
		aren't enough to go around.
		Management has them. You don't. If
		they throw Bluestar into Chapter
		11--which I think they will--then
		they can use bankruptcy laws to
		break your unions and your
		contracts and throw you guys off
		the property.

	We hear a loud crunching sound as Bud's father bites into a
	roll, glaring at Gekko.

				WILMORE
			(pilot)
		With all due respect, Mr. Gekko,
		what's to prevent you from doing
		the same thing?

				GEKKO
		Cause I have a way around all this,
		a way we can all make money and
		make this airline profitable again.
		What do you say we cut to the chase.
		I'm asking for a modest twenty
		percent across-the-board wage cut.

	Carl drops his fork on the plate. Gekko goes on.

				GEKKO
		And seven more hours a month.

	Toni Carpenter and Duncan Wilmore exchange questionable looks.

				CARPENTER
		What kind of time frame are we
		talking about here?

				GEKKO
		Give me a year. If we're still
		losing money, the reductions stand.
		If however, we move into the black,
		I return part of the givebacks,
		salaries go back to present levels,
		and...
			(a beat)
		we institute an employee profit
		sharing program with stock. You'll
		own part of the airline.

	Carpenter and Wilmore react with surprise, it's obvious they
	weren't expecting the profit sharing part. Bud smiles at
	Darien and looks to his father, who examines a sushi roll
	before putting it back.

				WILMORE
		Are you prepared to put that in
		writing?

				GEKKO
		I'll have a letter of agreement
		drawn up within two days.

				CARPENTER
		What's your marketing strategy? How
		do you plan to return us to
		profitability?

				GEKKO
		Why don't I give Bud an opportunity
		to answer that.

	Darien and Carl turn to Bud, who puts down his wine glass.
	 
			BUD
		Thank you Mr. Gekko. First of all I
		want you to know my door will
		always be open to you cause I know
		from my Dad it's you guys that keep
		Bluestar flying. One -- Modernize.
		Our computer software is weak, we
		update it, we squeeze every dollar
		out of each seat and mile flown.
		You don't sell a seat to a guy for
		$89 when he's willing to pay $389.
		Effective inventory management
		through computerization will
		increase our load factor by 5 to
		20%, that translates to
		approximately 50 to 200 million
		dollars in revenues; the point is,
		we can beat the majors at a price
		war. Two -- Advertising -- more,
		more, and aggressive, attack the
		majors. Three -- expand our hubs to
		Atlanta, North Carolina and Dallas,
		reorganize all our feeder schedules,
		think Big -- guys, we're going
		after the majors!

	The men are visibly shaken by Bud's determination.

				GEKKO
			(looking for reactions)
		Cards are on the table. What do you
		think?

				WILMORE
			(restrained, hopeful)
		If you mean what you say, I think
		we're in the ball park. I'll take
		it to my people.

				CARPENTER
			(approvingly)
		You've sketched some broad strokes.
		I'd like to see the fine print. But
		so far so good.

	Gekko looks to Carl Fox who, putting down knife and fork,
	breaks his silence.

				CARL
		I guess if a man lives long enough,
		he gets to see everything. And I
		mean everything. What else do you
		have in your bag of tricks, Mr. Gekko?

	Bud tenses, looking at his father. Gekko ignores the
	innuendo and replies softly.

				GEKKO
		Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving
		much more. If you have any
		suggestions I'll be glad to listen.

				CARL
		There came into Egypt a Pharoah who
		did not know.

				GEKKO
			(smiling)
		I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?

				CARL
			(smiling)
		No, it's a prophecy. The rich have
		been doing it to the poor since the
		beginning of time. The only
		difference between the Pyramids and
		the Empire State Building is that
		the Egyptians didn't have unions.
			(looking at Wilmore
			and Carpenter)
		I know what this guy is about--
		greed--he's in and out for the buck
		and he don't take prisoners. He
		don't give a damn about Northstar
		or us ...

				BUD
		Now, wait a minute, Dad...

				GEKKO
			(shrugs, keeping his composure)
		Sure. What's worth doing is worth
		doing for money. It's a bad bargain
		where nobody gains. And if this
		deal goes through, we all gain.

	Carl throws down his napkin, rises from the chair, looks at
	the others.

				CARL
			(looks at Bud)
		'Course my son did work three
		summers as a baggage handler and
		freight loader. With those
		qualifications, why should I doubt
		his ability to run an airline?

	There is frozen silence at the table.

				GEKKO
		Fine, if you don't want us, stay
		with the scum in present
		management--dedicated to running
		you and Bluestar into the ground.

				CARL
		...that "scum" built this company
		up from one plane in thirty years,
		they made something out of nothing,
		and if that's a scum I'll take one
		over a rat any day...

	Carl turns and leaves. Bud glances at Gekko, reading his
	piercing look. He hurries after his father.

	INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Bud catches up to Carl, waiting for the elevator, hammering
	him.

				BUD
			(seething)
		Congratulations. You did a great
		job of embarrassing me in there--
		not to mention yourself! Save the
		"workers of the world unite" speech
		for next time Dad, I heard it too
		much growing up. You're gonna get
		axed Dad, no two ways about it, you
		and the whole airline are going
		down the tubes, you hear me, just
		like Braniff, you don't have a
		chance in hell, and if it isn't
		Gekko it's gonna be some other killer.

	INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	Carl steps into the elevator, Bud follows.

				CARL
		He's got your prick in his back
		pocket, son, and you're standing
		naked in the display window of
		Macy's. He's using you. Only you're
		too blind to see it.

				BUD
		No, what I see is a jealous old
		machinist who can't stand that his
		son's become more successful than
		himself.

				CARL
		What you see, son, is a man who
		never measured success by the size
		of a man's wallet.

				BUD
		That's because you never had the
		guts to go out into the world and
		stake your claim.

				CARL
			(lamentably)
		Boy, if that's what you think, I
		must've really screwed up my job as
		a father.

	INT. BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT

	Bud and Carl exit the elevator and head across the luxury
	lobby.

				CARL (CONT'D)
		...as far as being axed, I'm still
		here and as long as I am, I have a
		responsibility not just to me but
		to the union members I represent...

				BUD
			(pleading now)
		Your responsibility, Dad, is to
		present the facts, not your
		opinions, to the men... you're
		gonna destroy their lives, Dad!
		Don't do it to 'em. Give it a
		chance. Let the membership decide
		for themselves, Dad. Please.

				CARL
		I'll be damned that when my men
		come to me tomorrow morning,
		wanting to know what's going on,
		I'm going to lie to them!

				BUD
		Your men! All my life "your men"
		have been able to count on you? Why
		is it that you've never been there
		for me?

	They head through the doors, out onto the street.

	EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT

	Bud following Carl.

				BUD
		And what if you're wrong? What if
		one day, the sun didn't rise in the
		East and birds didn't fly South in
		winter and for once in your life
		your compass was off? Huh?

	He grabs Carl by the arm, stopping him.

				BUD (CONT'D)
		Would you be willing to wreck your
		men's future? My future? Please...
		Dad. Think. Be practical, for a
		change. I'm asking you, I'm fucking
		begging you...

	Bud lets go of Carl's arm. Carl looks at his son, seeing the
	desperation. Sadness and confusion take hold of him.

				CARL
		I don't sleep with no whore and I
		don't wake up with no whore. That's
		how I live with myself, Buddy. I
		don't know how you do.
			(a beat)
		I hope I'm wrong, I'll let them
		decide for themselves, that much I
		promise you.

	He walks away. Bud watches him go, knows he has won.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	Bud, increasingly frazzled and determined, dark circles
	under his eyes paces with the phone...

				JANET
			(his secretary)
		Mr. Dixon Brandt on 3...

				BUD
			(wearily switching over)
		What's up Dixon?
			(stopping, focusing)
		Calm down! What are you talking about?

						INTERCUT TO:

	INT. DIXON'S CABIN - ASPEN COLORADO - DAY

	Dixon, the rich man's son and ski bum, is yelling on the
	other end of the line.

				DIXON
		...this guy who said he was from
		the Security Exchange Commission,
		whatever the hell that is, calls
		and wants to ask me about that
		stock I bought...

				BUD
			(nervous)
		What'd you tell him?

				DIXON
		I told him I was in the bathroom
		and I'd call him right back. What
		the hell was I supposed to say
		Buddy, you got me into...

				BUD
		Look Dixon, calm down! It's not
		illegal to buy stock or to be right.
		And it's not all that unusual to be
		spot checked on a big buy. Tell him
		you did your homework and you
		thought the stock was a sound
		investment.

				DIXON
		What if he asks where I got the money?

				BUD
		Tell 'em your father gave it to you.

				DIXON
		What if they call him?

				BUD
		They won't. That's not their
		jurisdiction.

				DIXON
		You sure?

				BUD
		Yes! Read the Constitution, it's
		all in there. And remember--you
		don't know anything, nothing.

				DIXON
		I don't know anything!

				BUD
		Good. Then call him back. And call
		me back. Don't worry.

	He hangs up, a worried expression, Marv entering to break
	his concentration.

				MARV
		Hey you hear the news. I just got a
		job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat
		'em and Howe." Yuk yuk.

				BUD
			(icy)
		Didn't I tell you to knock before
		you came in here?

				MARV
		Hey the door was open.

				BUD
		Then get out and close it behind you.

				MARV
			(pause)
		You know what you need, buddy
		buddy--an optorectomy. That's when
		they cut the nerve that runs from
		your brain to your rectum--to
		change that shitty attitude of yours.

				BUD
		Get the hell out!

	Marv slams the door on his way...

	EXT. FEDERAL BUILDING - DOWNTOWN NEW YORK - DAY

	Long shot of the towering stone structure. A tall angular
	figure crosses through the glass doors with a bulky folder
	under his arm...

	INT. LOBBY - DAY

	The man flashes his ID to a SECURITY GUARD who buzzes him
	through the gate... He walks towards us and we see he is the
	familiar tall, baby-faced INVESTIGATOR from the S.E.C.
	Options Watch Office... he gets in an elevator.

	INT. S.E.C. INVESTIGATION OFFICES - DAY

	He walks into the office of a CHIEF INVESTIGATOR. A balding
	sharp-featured man in a drab suit with bags of hard work
	under his eyes looks up as the young investigator places the
	large file in front of him.

	INT. ROGER BARNES' OFFICE - DAY

	Bud enters, preoccupied. Barnes is nervous.

				BUD
		So what's the problem?

				ROGER
			(whispers)
		...got a strange call from the SEC.
		They asked to see my records...
		Bud, this is a heavy...

				BUD
			(shrugs)
		....Relax Roget
			(French pronunciation)
		You're 82M in the account numbers
		and I'm the Invisible Man...
		they're always looking for red
		flags, Gekko's always getting
		checked by them, they never come up
		with anything... we're invulnerable
		on this...

				ROGER
		Alright... I just wanna slow down
		Bud... no more calls for awhile, no
		lunches... we suspend our business,
		alright...

				BUD
		Sure Roger, whatever you want, it's
		cool.

	A young lawyer pops his head in the room.

				LAWYER
		Rog, come on, bring the cost report.
		They started.
			(exits)


				ROGER
			(standing, to Bud)
		Gekko asked us into the Bluestar
		deal. We're reviewing the
		timetables, wanna come?

				BUD
			(surprised)
		He never told me...

				ROGER
		You're just the President of the
		company, what do you know? ... Come
		on.

	As they walk out.

	INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

	Smoky, coffee cups and food. THREE LAWYERS, TWO INVESTMENT
	BANKERS, THREE COMMERCIAL BANKERS, sleeves rolled up, ties
	askew. A blackboard with Bluestar's assets diagrammed. A
	combat mood in the room. Bud walking in, feels vaguely
	worried, something is not quite right.

				ROGER
		You guys know the new chief of
		Bluestar... Bud Fox.

	They nod vaguely respectful but Bud's obviously a figure
	head to them, takes a seat off to the side. The bull-like
	INVESTMENT BANKER, Vietnam vet, in shirt and suspenders, is
	on the attack against the stuffier Commercial Bankers.

				INVESTMENT BANKER
		Look guys, what's the problem,
		let's for the kill...Gekko's got
		12% and climbing plus the unions
		are in his pocket for now,
		everybody on the street knows the
		stock's in play
			(overlapping voice:
			up 2 1/4 since the open)
		by next week the street's gonna own
		Bluestar and management won't be
		able to do anything but poison
		their own pill. Why are you guys
		dicking around? Is the bank
		financing in place or are we gonna
		have more and more meetings? Our
		firm's gonna guarantee 25% of the
		total debt structure in long-term
		junk bonds, now you guys either
		sign this piece of paper right now
		or we're gonna pull and head for
		another bank for the 75...

				COMMERCIAL BANKER
			(older man, appeasing)
		...look, we have 30 banks ready to
		participate in a 4 year revolving
		credit line but we have to have
		your assurance to pay back most of
		the loan in the first 6 months, and
		the only way...

				INVESTMENT BANKER
			(intermittently interrupting)
		... 30 banks, isn't that
		wonderful...you got it, no problem.

				COMMERCIAL BANKER
			(insistent)
		...and the only way we can see this
		happening is liquidating the
		hangars and the planes. Can you
		people guarantee that?

	Bud freezes where he sits...it all comes crashing down in a
	milli-second on that word "liquidate" -- shock now spreading
	on Bud's face...

				INVESTMENT BANKER
		Guaranteed! No sweat...we already
		got the Bleezburg brothers lined up
		to build condos where the hangars
		are, we can lay off the planes with
		Mexicana, who are dumb enough to
		buy 'em and Texas Air is drooling
		at my kneecaps to get the slots and
		the routes. What's the problem?
		it's done..

				ROGER
			(passing a paper to
			the commercial banker)
		This is the pricetag on the 737s,
		the gates, the hangars, the routes,
		we got it all nailed right down to
		the typewriters...

	Bud sits there numbly, a sickening feeling taking hold of
	him as the camera and music track and trap him tighter and
	tighter. The lawyers' voices distorting in the background.

				INVESTMENT BANKER
		...'course the beauty of it is the
		overfunded pension fund. Gekko gets
		the 75 million in there. Fifty
		million buys him the minimum
		annuities for 6,000 employees and
		he walks away with the rest. All
		in, he'll net 60 to 70 million. Not
		bad for a month's work.
			(to Bud)
		Your man did his homework, Fox,
		you're gonna have the shortest
		executive career since the Pope who
		got poisoned...now he'll really
		start believing he's "Gekko the
		Great."

	INT. RECEPTION AREA - GEKKO'S OFFICE - DAY

	Bud walks intently past the receptionist and down the long
	white marble hall.

	INT. NATALIE'S DESK - DAY

	Natalie is on the phone. Bud marches past her desk.

				NATALIE
		Yes, he wants to change that
		appointment to...
			(cupping the receiver)
		Bud--you can't go in there. He's in
		a meeting!

	He ignores her and throws open Gekko's door.

	INT. GEKKO'S OFFICE - DAY

	Gekko is talking with the LAWYERS and BANKERS from the
	Bluestar deal, as Bud barges in.

				GEKKO
			(looks up)
		I didn't know we had a meeting
		schedule for this morning.

				BUD
		I'm sorry, this can't wait.

	Gekko stares at him with piercing eyes.

				GEKKO
		Will you gentlemen excuse us for a
		few minutes?

	The lawyers and bankers get up and discreetly leave the room.
	Gekko waits for them to go, turns back to Bud.

				GEKKO
		What the hell do you want?

				BUD
		I found out about the garage sale
		down at Bluestar. Why?

	Gekko is taken by surprise.

				GEKKO
		Last night I read Rudy the story of
		Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot.
		Know what happened: he stuck his
		nose in that honey pot once too
		often and got stung.

				BUD
		Maybe you ought to read him
		Pinocchio. You told me you were
		going to turn Bluestar around. Not
		upside down. You used me.

				GEKKO
		You're walking around blind without
		a cane, sport. A fool and his money
		are lucky to get together in the
		first place.

				BUD
		Why do you need to wreck this company?

				GEKKO
		Because it's wreckable. I took
		another look and I changed my mind.

				BUD
		If these people lose their jobs,
		nowhere to go. My father worked at
		Bluestar for twenty-four years. I
		gave 'em my word.

				GEKKO
			(hard)
		It's all about bucks, kid, the rest
		is conversation...
			(loosening)
		Bud, you're still going to be
		president. And when the time comes,
		you'll parachute out a rich man.
		With the money you're going to
		make, your father won't have to
		work another day in his life.

				BUD
		Tell me, Gordon--when does it all
		end? How many yachts can you
		waterski behind? How much is enough?

				GEKKO
		Buddy, it's not a question of
		enough. It's a zero sum game, sport.
		Somebody wins and somebody loses.
		Money itself isn't lost or made,
		it's simply transferred from one
		perception to another. Like magic.
		That painting cost $60,000 10 years
		ago. I could sell it today for
		$600,000. The illusion has become
		real. And the more real it becomes,
		the more desperately they want it.
		Capitalism at its finest.

				BUD
			(again)
		How much is enough Gordon?

				GEKKO
		The richest one percent of this
		country owns half the country's
		wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One
		third of that comes from hard work,
		two thirds of it comes from
		inheritance, interest on interest
		accumulation to widows and idiot
		sons and what I do -- stock and
		real estate speculation. It's
		bullshit. Ninety percent of the
		American people have little or no
		net worth. I create nothing; I own.
		We make the rules, Buddy, the news,
		war, peace, famine, upheaval; the
		cost of a paper clip.
			(picking one up)
		We pull the rabbit out of the hat
		while everybody else sits around
		their whole life wondering how we
		did it...
			(crosses to Bud)
		...you're not naive enough to think
		we're living in a democracy are
		you, Buddy? It's the free market.
		You're one of us now...take
		advantage of it. You got the killer
		instinct, kid, stick with me. I got
		things to teach you...

				BUD
		Obviously...

	As he puts his arm around Bud, leading him to the door.

				GEKKO
		Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna
		discuss this with you at the right
		time. Look, why don't you calm down
		and come to the apartment for
		dinner tonight. Bring Darien...

				BUD
			(at the door,
			confused, drained)
		...I can't make it tonight.

				GEKKO
		Are you with me Buddy?

	At the door, a look of unmistakable power...and danger.

				GEKKO
		I want you with me.
			(waits)


				BUD
		I'm with you Gordon...

	He walks out the door, the misery he is in washing his brow.

				GEKKO
			(to Natalie)
		...be another minute, Natalie.

	As he crosses back to the coffee table and punches up a
	phone number.

				GEKKO
		This is Gordon Gekko. Now...
			(a beat, with
			controlled rage)
		I want zip-locked mouths on
		Bluestar, or I'm gonna personally
		come down there and rip out your
		fucking throats!

	EXT. GEKKO OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

	Bud walks out, heading up the street, absent amid the
	scurrying mid-day hordes tearing up the street for the loot
	inside.

	EXT. BUD'S CONDO - DAY

	Darien approaches, carrying groceries, enters the building.

	INT. BUD'S CONDO - DAY

	Bud is slumped on the couch, a spent bottle of tequila in
	front of him. Outside the twilight is quickening into night,
	shadows, scurrying across the unlit room.... for the first
	time we see him sucking on a cigarette.

	Darien opens the door and freezes, surveying the living room.
	A broken vase on the carpet, a curtain ripped off a window,
	a painting upended, a chair overturned, selected but not
	frenzied damage...

				DARIEN
		Bud?...What's going on?

	She puts down the grocery bags, frightened.

				BUD
		I've been played like a grand-
		piano--by the master, Gekko the
		Great...and today was the big crash.
		Liquidation sale. He's gonna carve
		Bluestar into little pieces and
		sell it all off...

	Darien registering this, is picking up pieces of the broken
	vase.

				DARIEN
		I'm sorry. I was afraid something
		like this could happen.

				BUD
		Talk about being bent over the sink
		of life and being dry humped. I
		handed it to him on a silver
		platter. I told my father and those
		people...

				DARIEN
		Buddy, it's not your fault, and
		it's not your decision.

				BUD
			(evenly)
		I'm not gonna let it happen Darien.

	She stops, lights a cigarette, growing concern.

				DARIEN
		Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you.
		You've worked hard to get where you
		are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar
		someone else will; and who's to say
		they won't do the same thing.

				BUD
		At least I wouldn't be pulling the
		trigger.

	She sighs...comes over, tries to shake some sense into him!

				DARIEN
		Are you mad! Why are you doing this!
		We're so close, the town is going
		to be ours. Don't throw away your
		future Bud!

				BUD
		I can stay with the brokerage firm.
		And you're doing fine. We can
		survive without Gordon Gekko.

				DARIEN
			(pointed)
		I'm not looking to just survive.
		I've been doing that all my life.

				BUD
			(getting the drift)
		What the hell's that supposed to mean?

	Darien moves out from his approximate circle, wrestling with
	what she wants to say...until she turns and says it.

				DARIEN
		That if you make an enemy of Gordon
		Gekko, I won't be there to stand by
		you.

	Bud is stunned...and hurt.

				BUD
		You really mean that?
			(lashing out)
		What'd he promise you? To take you
		public? I guess without Gordon's
		money and seal of approval, I'm not
		such a hot investment anymore.
		You're just the best money can buy,
		Darien...

				DARIEN
		You're not exactly pure Bud, you
		went after Gekko with the same
		vengeance you went after me. Look
		in the mirror before...

				BUD
			(glaring at her)
		I'm looking...and I sure don't like
		what I see.

	She collects her things and walks to the door.

				DARIEN
		Fair enough...but it's not that
		simple, Bud. When I was down and
		had nothing, it was Gordon who
		helped me. He got me all my
		clients -- you among them...
			(snaps her fingers)
		and he can take it away like that.
			(a beat)
		You may find out one day -- that
		when you've had money and lost it,
		it's worse than never having had it
		at all.

	Bud steps across to her in a rage.

				BUD
		That's bullshit! Step out that
		door, I'm changing the locks.

	She opens the door saddened.

				DARIEN
		You may not believe this Bud but I
		really do care for you. I think we
		could've made a good team...but
		that's how it goes...

				BUD
		Get the hell out!

	She does. Bud stares at the closed door, mute, numb, totally
	devastated.... the loss is not just Darien, it is total...
	He looks at his face in the reflection of a wall mirror...

	INT. BUD'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - DAY

	Waiting for the elevator. Darien also looks at herself a
	beat in the hall mirror. She's crying. Then she steels
	herself and enters the elevator.

	INT. BUD'S CONDO - DAY

	The same realtor, SYLVIe DRIMMER, who sold him the place, is
	back. The phone is ringing, unanswered...

				SYLVIE
		...well, the market's dead, hon,
		even the rich are bitching,
		nothing's moving except termites
		and cockroaches, and with my
		commission being what it is...

				BUD
			(cutting her off)
		Save the rap, just sell it -- fast!

	He's in his socks, unshaven, smoking, he looks like he's
	been on a bender for the weekend. The phone stops ringing.
	He turns and walks into the bedroom, slamming the door
	behind him.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	Bud walks in, a different, more serious look in his eye,
	purposeful. Past CAROLYN and JANET at the outer desk. They
	stop what they're doing and look up at him surprised.

				CAROLYN
		Bud! Where you been the last two days?

				BUD
			(ignoring the tone in
			her voice)
		...Janet get my father on the phone
		and the two other union reps,
		urgent...

	He notices her face, something's wrong.

				JANET
		Your mom just called, Mr. Fox. Your
		father... he...

				BUD
			(sensing it)
		What! What happened?!

				CAROLYN
		He had a heart attack, hon, but
		he's okay, he's at the hospital...

				BUD
			(runs out)
		Oh Christ!
	 
INT. BUD'S BMW - DAY

	Bud weaving fast through traffic.

	INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

	Bud races past the nurses' desks and down the hallway.

	EXT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

	Bud's MOTHER is outside with Dominick Amato and another
	neighbor just visiting, bringing candies.

				BUD
			(lighting a cigarette)
		Mom! How is he?

				MOM
			(shaken)
		...he was complaining about chest
		pains at work. Next thing I know he
		collapsed... Oh Buddy, talk to him,
		he's so stubborn.

				AMATO
			(to Bud)
		...don't worry, he's got another 20
		years in him. He's a tough ol' nut,
		your Dad...

	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

	The blinds are drawn. His Dad lies there, tubes down his
	nose, hooked up to an IV unit and monitors. Bud comes over.
	Carl, glassy-eyed, significantly frailer, nods to him. It's
	obvious that more damage was done than Bud expected. Mom
	comes into the room with him, stands there.

				BUD
		Hiya Dad...
			(sits, smiles)
		What was it? Mom talked too much or
		was it her spaghetti? I mean
		pasta...
			(Mom bringing a
			handkerchief to her eyes)
		I told you never to lift a 747 by
		yourself...

	Carl, smiles weakly, on pain killers. Bud pulls out a
	cigarette. He fumbles with it before putting it away, trying
	to keep a gruff tone between them.

				BUD
		...you even got me smoking
		now...second one Dad, you're
		pushing your luck, I guess you know
		that...I guess you gotta pull
		through this one Dad...for mom, for
		me...I guess I never told you
		but...I love you Dad, I love you
		more than I ever.
			(begins to weep)
		...I didn't mean those things I
		said to you...you're a hero all the
		way Dad, you're a rock...the best.

	The words seem to come flowing out of Bud as Carl's eyes
	fill with tears.

				BUD
		...and you were right about Gekko.
		He's one son of a bitch...through
		and through.

	Carl stares at him, beginning to understand.

				BUD (CONT'D)
		He's gonna break up Bluestar.

	Carl reacts violently in his eyes but Bud soothes him...in
	dead earnest, trying to be deliberate and clear in his meaning.

				BUD (CONT'D)
		...but I gotta plan Dad, it can
		work, I can save the airline, I
		know you got no reason to believe
		me but I want you to trust me...I
		need to talk to the unions...Can I
		speak for you?

	Carl's eyes.

				BUD (CONT'D)
		Your words, not mine...

				CARL
			(weakly)
		You speak for me, son.

	INT. AUCTION ROOM - DAY

	Gekko and Darien are seated together in the back row. Darien
	looks serious and distracted in spite of all the excitement
	going on around her. It is the big spring Impressionist sale
	and all the major players, or their representatives are here.
	Gekko is bidding.

				GEKKO
		Look over there sunshine. I'm up
		against Richard Feigen.

	He is on a roll, electric. As the price mounts and surpasses
	the two million dollar mark, Gekko rises and walks down the
	side aisle to the front, never taking his eyes away from the
	auctioneer. He stands agressively, arms akimbo, in a nose to
	nose confrontation.

				AUCTIONEER
		Once, twice, three times. Sold to
		Mr. Gordon Gekko.

	EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF AUCTION HOUSE - DAY

	They walk the sunny streets, a jubilant Gekko, savoring his
	triumph, grabs Darien's arm.

				GEKKO
		What do you say we go get a suite
		at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne?
		Celebrate, just like the old times
		Sunshine.

				DARIEN
			(indignantly)
		Those days are over, Gordon. They
		were over a long time ago.

				GEKKO
			(condescendingly but
			paying little
			attention to the rebuff)
		Can't blame me for trying. You look
		as beautiful as that painting I
		just bought.

	He pats her on the back in a preprietary fashion.

				GEKKO (CONT'D)
			(mockingly)
		So what's the problem Sunshine? You
		look like Black Thursday. Bad case
		of puppy love?

				DARIEN
			(indignant)
		It's not puppy love, Gordon.
		Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.

				GEKKO
			(off handed)
		Sorry to hear that. I thought the
		kid had staying power.

				DARIEN
		It's over you, Gordon.

				GEKKO
			(cooly)
		You told him about us?

				DARIEN
		No, are you crazy? And I don't want
		him ever to know. Do you
		understand?...

	She moves closed and takes Gordon's hand.

				DARIEN (CONT'D)
		I want to ask you a big favor,
		Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.

				GEKKO
			(stroking her face)
		Now tell me, why would I want to do
		that?

				DARIEN
		Because I don't want to see him hurt.

				GEKKO
		Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had
		a little talk. We came to an
		understanding.
			(takes her hand paternally)
		I want you to go back to him.
		Soothe him. Help keep his head
		straight. Okay?

				DARIEN
		I can't...and I won't.

				GEKKO
		Come on, we both like Buddy. But
		this bleeding heart puppy love act
		is over the top... It doesn't fit.

				DARIEN
		Maybe it does. Don't patronize me
		Gordon.

				GEKKO
		You and I are the same, Darien.
		We're smart enough not to buy into
		the oldest myth running: love... A
		fiction created by people who got
		nothing to keep them from jumping
		out of windows.

				DARIEN
		You're really twisted, Gordon.
		You're incapable of giving to
		anybody because deep down inside
		you there's a poverty that every
		last dollar in the world won't fill.

				GEKKO
		Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared
		little girl all wrapped in a pretty
		grown-up package. Does this mean
		you're ready to cut the umbilical
		cord and step out into the world on
		your own? Because, Darien, if
		you're through with me, you're
		through with everything I'm a part of.

	Darien's eyes cloud over...the look of a scared child being
	banished by her father. Then...

				DARIEN
		I know...but maybe, just maybe
		Gordon, I'm good enough so I don't
		need you anymore.

	She walks away.

	INT. MCGREGOR'S BAR - QUEENS - DAY

	Bud is seated at a corner table with the BLUESTAR UNION
	REPS: Duncan Wilmore, ALPA LEADER and Toni Carpenter, AFA
	rep; also jointed by machinists, Dominick Amato and Charley
	Dent, sitting in for his father's union.

				BUD
		...the stock's at 19 1/4 and it's
		going up. Gekko figures by breaking
		up Bluestar, it's worth at least
		$30 a share. That means he'll buy
		up to 23 or 24 and still think he's
		making money.

				WILMORE
		How do you know that the stock is
		going to go up?

				BUD
			(pointedly)
		You really don't want to know any
		more than that, Mr. Wilmore. Let's
		just say I have some friends.

				WILMORE
			(getting his drift)
		Okay. What happens then?

				BUD
		When the stock hits 23, you guys go
		to Gekko and lower the boom. Once
		he learns he has no union
		concession, he's going to head for
		the hills. He'll sell everything
		he's got.

				CARPENTER
		Yeah. But who's going to buy then
		and what's to prevent another shark
		from coming along and devouring us?

	INT. WILDMAN BUILDING - FIFTH AVENUE APARTMENT - DAY

	Bud, Duncan Wilmore, Toni Carpenter, Dominick and Charley,
	an unlikely looking group in the plushness of the apartment
	lobby.

				BUD
		We have an appointment to see Mr.
		Wildman.

	INT. WILDMAN APARTMENT - DAY

	Lofty windows overlooking the Park, an impeccably-decorated
	apartment with coffee and rolls laid out, a young AIDE
	quietly moving around. Bud and the others are on sofas
	around the imposing figure of Wildman in a chair across.

				BUD
		Sir Lawrence, what would you say to
		owning Bluestar Airlines with union
		concessions--at $18 a share...and
		in the process hanging Gordon Gekko
		out in the wind to twist.... ?

	Sir Lawrence leans back in his chair, equably...

				WILDMAN
		I might be very interested, but why?
		Why you mate -- how'd you get mixed
		up with Gekko? He doesn't know the
		difference between raiding and
		insider trading. I do. The SEC does.
		I hope you do...

				BUD
		Let's just say Mr. Gekko and I have
		a conflict of interest. I want to
		see this airline work...
			(pointing to the
			documents in front of Wildman)
		...the figures here show it can.

				WILDMAN
			(to the others)
		... and you're prepared to take
		these large salary cuts.

				WILMORE
		...we are. But we want a contract
		agreement -- iron-clad -- that if
		you buy it, you can't break it up.

				WILDMAN
			(hands behind his head)
		I'm still listening...

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	Bud hurries in, past Marv on the phone with an irate customer.

				MARV
		Well, if that's how you feel--the
		hell with you too. And strong
		letter to follow.

	He slams the phone down.

				BUD
		You don't have to agree with me,
		Marv; but I think I've been a bit
		of a schmuck lately.
			(beat, waits)


				MARV
			(off the cuff)
		I agree. Go thou and sin no more.

				BUD
		I want to make it up to you.
		Bluestar, put all your clients in it.

				MARV
			(animated, grabs the phone)
		Thanks, buddy, buddy, I'm back.
		Say, Buddy, those optorectomies do
		work wonders.

	Bud intersecting Lou Mannheim smoking a cigarette and having
	a hard time walking.

				BUD
		Bluestar, Mr. Mannheim. Put all
		your clients in it.

	Davls looks gravely at Bud.

				MANNHEIM
		I don't know where you get your
		information, son, but I don't like
		it. The only reason I'm gonna do it
		is...I need the money, that's the
		problem with money--it makes you do
		things you don't want to do.

	Bud hears him, walks on...

				MARV
			(into phone)
		Miss Bloom, Marvin. You got cancer
		in your portfolio, but I got the
		cure...Bluestar Airlines...

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	Bud on the phone, checking his quotron.

				BUD
		Listen I need a favor and it's a
		quick scalp for you. Two hundred
		thousand at 19 1/2; can you
		position it in one of your equity
		funds?

				JANET
			(voicebox)
		...call waiting on 7.

				BUD
		Hold on...
			(switches over, hushed)
		...listen "blue horseshoe loves
		Bluestar Airlines"...

	Immediately goes back to the other line.

	INT. THE WALL STREET JOURNAL OFFICES - DAY

	The REPORTER, who Bud anonymously called on the earlier
	Anacott Steel buy, hangs up. He rises from his desk and
	crosses the busy news floor, over to his EDITOR.

				WSJ REPORTER
		Bluestar's in play.

	INT. NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE - DAY

	A RUNNER dashes up to the BLUESTAR AIRLINES post, where a
	heated crowd is gathered, amidst heavy trading. He elbows
	his way over to a TRADER, handing him the ticket. The TRADER
	holds up the buy order, screaming, making frantic hand
	signals, in search of a seller. Faces in the crowd look up
	at the broad tape.

	CAMERA TILTS TO:

	BLUESTAR (BST), the stock quote flashing across the BROAD
	TAPE--upticking to 20 1/4.

	INT. BROKERAGE OFFICE - DAY

	Marv, on the phone pitching, eyes glued to the office TAPE--
	as BST jumps to 21 1/4.

				MARV
		I love it...I do love it so!

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	The quotron now climbs to 22 1/8!

				BUD
			(into phone)
		Yeah. I see it at 22 1/8 and I
		don't know what to make of it.

	INT. GEKKO'S OFFICE - DAY

	He paces on the other end of the phone, real anger showing;
	now Alex and Susan seen in b.g.

				GEKKO
		The word's out. Your union buddies
		are talking. Get me in at a 45
		degree angle and I mean all the way
		in! Slash and burn, buy everything
		you can get up to 22. Then call me.
		When I get the sonofabitch who
		leaked this I'm gonna kill him! I'm
		gonna tear his eyeballs out, I'm
		gonna suck his skull!!

	As he glances at his quotron the stock ticks up another 1/8th.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	All the BROKERS have jumped into the action, avidly watching
	Bluestar's stock climb on the BROAD TAPE. Bud sweeps into
	the room and looks up at the board as the stock hits 22 7/8.

				MARV
		The stock's going to Pluto!

				BUD
		Start unloading.

				MARV
		Sell?

				BUD
		Now! Tell everyone to dump!

	Marv nods, and rushes away. Bud crosses past Mannheim's office.

				BUD
		Get out of Bluestar!

	In background Marv is spreading the word, brokers frantically
	grabbing phones, calling clients to sell.

	INT. GEKKO'S OFFICE - DAY

	Gekko looks up from his quotron and shouts to his troops on
	the phones.

				GEKKO
		Who the hell's out there? What are
		the arbs saying? It's gotta be a
		big hitter.

				ALEX
		They don't know what's going on!

				SUSAN
		Everybody and his mother is buying!

	Natalie enters the room, flustered.

				NATALIE
		Mr. Gekko, there's a whole bach of
		people from Bluestar Airlines
		outside demanding to see you.

				GEKKO
		What the hell do they want?

				WILMORE (O.S.)
		I'd be happy to tell you.

	As Duncan, Toni Carpenter, Dominick Amato, Charley Dent and
	SEVERAL other assorted UNION MEMBERS march into the room.
	Gekko is taken by surprise, but stays calm.

				WILMORE
		We know what you're up to, Gekko,
		and let me tell you this from here,
			(hits his heart)
		you suck eggs, mister, over my dead
		body you ain't gonna break up
		Bluestar.

				GEKKO
		You guys must know something nobody
		else knows. If those are my plans,
		it's the first I've heard of it.

				CARPENTER
		Would you care to put that in writing?

				GEKKO
		I'd like to remind you we already
		have an agreement, which I expect
		you to honor.

				WILMORE
		Well in that case, I hope you have
		your pilot's license.

				AMATO
		Don't worry, Gekko, we wouldn't let
		the engines fall out of the plane.

				CARPENTER
			(regretfully)
		But the reservations systems can
		get awfully screwed up, if we're
		not paying attention.
	 
			CHARLEY DENT
		And a lot of baggage headed to St.
		Petersburg could easily find its
		way to Pittsburgh.

				GEKKO
		Listen, you clowns, there's
		somebody else out there trying to
		buy your airline, if you want to be
		Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla
		the Hun be my guest!

				WILMORE
		We'll take our chances.
			(tips his hat)
		Nice to see you again, Mr. Gekko.

	They file out of the room. The phone lines have lit up like
	a Christmas tree. Alex answers a call.

				ALEX
			(to Gekko)
		Fox says Bluestar just hit 23. What
		do you want him to do?

				GEKKO
			(fractional pause, mad)
		Sell it all.
			(then, evenly)
		What the hell, so I'll only make
		ten million.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	Bud switches lines from Gekko to Larry Wildman.

				BUD
		Gekko's on the ropes--he's trying
		to sell, but there's not many
		takers, the stock's plummeting.

	EXT. WILDMAN'S YACHT - DAY

	Wildman is off the Long Island Sound waters in his boat
	lighting a cigar. Two beautiful women and an aide are with him.

				WILDMAN
		Well then... guess I'll have to
		carry him a few rounds before he
		drops.

	Switches lines, checking his quotron...

				WILDMAN
		Bluestar. Don't make a big deal.
		Buy it lightly on the way down.
			(emphatically)
		When it hits 18--buy it all.

	INT. NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE FLOOR - DAY

	Wildman's broker takes the order with a curt "got it" and
	dashes out of the cubicle over to the Bluestar post where a
	chaotic crowd is gathered, traders frantically screaming to
	sell Bluestar shares. He looks at the Big Board--sees an XTR
	drop to 17. When he raises his hand to buy, he is mobbed.

						DISSOLVE TO:

	The Big Board...a series of snappy dissolves accompanied by
	lively music shows the stock price falling to 16 1/2 ...

	INT. GEKKO'S OFFICE - DAY

	Alex, Ollie, Susan on the phones.

				OLLIE
		The arbs are getting killed.
		Where'd the buyers go!

				ALEX
			(worried)
		We're being devoured, Gordon.

	Harold Salt, walking on egg shells, looks to Gekko, who sits
	with the phone receiver crooked to his neck.

				HAROLD
		There's got to be a way out of
		this, Gordon.

				GEKKO
			(livid, losing it)
		Yeah, Harold, why don't you dial
		911.
			(into the receiver)
		Fox, where the hell are you? I'm
		losing millions.
			(a beat)
		Look, you got me into this airline,
		and you damn well better get me out.
		Because if you don't the only job
		you're going to get on the Street
		is sweeping it! You hear me, Fox--

						INTERCUT TO:
	 
INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	Bud scribbling an order ticket, replies on the other end.

				BUD
			(hard)
		You once told me don't get
		emotional about stock. Gordon,
		don't. The bid is 17 and going down.
		As your broker, I advise you to
		take it.

	Bud moves the phone away from his ear, at Gekko's cursing,
	and signs the ticket.

				BUD
			(urgent)
		Gordon, it's two minutes to close.
		What do you want to do?! Decide.

				GEKKO
			(a long beat)
		Dump it.

	Bud hangs up and rushes off with the ticket.

	INT. GEKKO'S DEN - NEW YORK APARTMENT - TWILIGHT

	The 35" television is on to:

				NEWSCASTER
		The big Wall Street story tonight
		is the  roller coaster ride of
		Bluestar Airlines. Fueled by
		takeover rumors, the stock soared
		to an all-time high of 24 1/8. Then
		when contradictory rumors later
		surfaced that the takeover was
		unfounded, buyers went running for
		cover, and the stock plummeted on
		gigantic volume to as low as 16 1/2
		before closing at 17.

	Camera discovers Gekko sitting, grimly watching the report.
	Rudy seen riding his toy car in background.

				NEWSCASTER
		...but then tonight, amidst all the
		scuttlebutt, another rumble shook
			(a beat)
		According to many sources, raider
		Sir Lawrence Wildman has stepped in
		and bought a substantial block of
		Bluestar and is going to announce a
		deal tomorrow at 18 that includes
		the support of the unions.

	Camera now tracks in close on Gekko as he absorbs the
	unexpected blow. O.S. Rudy yelling and squealing. Gekko
	leans back, putting the pieces together, his eyes narrowing
	into burning slits. He smashes the glass cocktail table with
	a massive paperweight as Kate hears it, shocked.

	EXT. WALL STREET - MORNING

	People rushing to work. Bud crosses the street, his face
	buried in The Financial Times. Insert: "SIR LAWRENCE WILDMAN
	MOUNTS BLUESTAR BUY WITH UNION SUPPORT".

	Satisfied, Bud folds the paper and heads into his office
	building.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	He walks past Carolyn the receptionist who is strangely mute...

				BUD
		Smile, Carolyn, there's justice in
		the world...

	INT. MAIN OFFICE - DAY

	He passes the CHINESE STOCKLADY. She sees him and manages to
	look away. Marvin exchanges a look with him but can't bring
	himself to talk. Bud wonders...the whole office seems
	silent, the other BROKERS stealing glances.

	...as he passes Lou Mannheim with Charlie Cushing, who
	ignores Bud...

				BUD
		How's it going Mr. Mannheim? Got
		out of Bluestar in time I hope?

	Mannheim stops, winds up. Bud impatient but polite.

				MANNHEIM
			(with gruff affection)
		Bud I like you, just remember
		something. Man looks in the abyss,
		there's nothing staring back at him.
		At that time a man finds his
		character--and that is what keeps
		him out of the abyss...
			(a beat, looks deeply)


				BUD
		I think I understand what you mean
		Mr. Mannheim.

	But not really. As, on this increasingly strange morning, he
	moves on past Janet who wants to tell his something but he
	cuts her off.

				BUD
		Get my father will you Janet?

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	As Bud walks in, the camera glides to reveal the young SEC
	INVESTIGATOR, who has been tracking Buddy, going through his
	files. A SECOND MAN, PATTERSON, is standing behind the desk
	using the phone as a bored-looking 3RD MAN and POLICEMAN
	stand off to the side with Hieronymus Lynch, who gives Bud a
	withering glance.

				PATTERSON
			(into phone)
		He just came in. I'll talk to you
		later.

	On Bud--a struck-dumb look passing to resignation, as if for
	a long time now, he has been expecting this.

				BUD
		I guess you're not here to open an
		IRA.

				PATTERSON
		Mr Fox, I'm Henry Patterson from
		the Postal Inspection Service...
		this is Evan Morrissey with The
		Securities and Exchange
		Investigation Office.
			(presents his ID and
			indicates MAN 3)
		... Mr. Ebanhopper from the US
		Attorney's Office.

				MORRISSEY
		Mr. Fox, you're under arrest for
		conspiracy to commit securities
		fraud and for violating the Insider
		Trader's Sanction Act.

	The handcuffs come out.

	EXT. SHEEPSMEADOW - CENTRAL PARK - TWILIGHT

	Long shot. Activity is winding down, a few sunbathers
	collecting their blankets. A solitary figure stands on a
	hill silhouetted by the sunset. A second figure appears on a
	footpath and starts climbing the hill towards the other man.

	Gekko waits, expressionless... Bud approaches him. They
	stand facing each other.

				GEKKO
		Hello Bud.

				BUD
		Gordon.

				GEKKO
		You sandbagged me on Bluestar.
			(smiles)
		I guess you think you taught the
		teacher a lesson, that you can make
		the tail wag the dog, huh?

	Bud looks away. Gekko's smile fades.

				GEKKO (CONT'D)
		Well let me cue you in: the ice is
		melting under your feet sport...

	Without warning, he grabs Buddy roughly by the lapels and
	lets out his inner rage with a series of smacks and slaps
	across his face.

				GEKKO (CONT'D)
		You think you could've gotten this
		far this fast with anybody else?
		You think you could be out there
		dicking somebody like Darien? No,
		you'd be cold calling dentists and
		widows to buy twenty shares of some
		dog stock! I took you in! A nobody!
		I opened doors for you!...I showed
		you how the system works!...

	Gekko slapping him harder and harder, Buddy staggering with
	the blows, saying nothing, not defending himself.

				GEKKO (CONT'D)
		...the value of information! How
		you get it! Anacott Steel, Brant
		Resources, Transuniversal, Fulham
		Oil. And this is how you pay back,
		you cockroach! I gave you Darien, I
		gave you your manhood. I gave you
		everything.

	He backhands Bud across the face. Bud lies on the ground,
	spent, as is Gordon breathing hard. Bud gets to his knees,
	blood streaming from his nose, his suit muddied. Passersby
	look on, wondering.

	Gekko seems to relent, the rage going into hurt, remorse. He
	hands Bud a handkerchief. Bud staunches the flow of blood
	from his nose.

				GEKKO (CONT'D)
			(softly, innocently)
		You could've been one of the great
		ones Bud...I look at you and see
		myself...Why?

	Bud looks at Gordon, torn by mixed emotions: the bonds they
	share and the betrayal wrought.

				BUD
			(shakes his head, thoughtfully)
		I don't know. My Dad once told me,
		"money is something you need in
		case you don't die tomortow." I
		guess I realized I'm just Bud Fox.
		And as much as I wanted to be
		Gordon Gekko--I'll always be Bud Fox.

	He looks at Gordon, as if wanting to say more, but doesn't.

	In long shot, Gordon stands alone as Bud walks away.

	EXT. TAVERN ON THE GREEN RESTAURANT - EVENING

	The DOORMAN looks askance. Bud, mud-splattered suit and
	bloody nose, walks straight past him thru the door.

	INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Several well-heeled DINERS look up from their haute cuisine,
	at the sight of Bud making his way toward the men's room.

	INT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Tight on Bud, staring at his reflection in the mirror, as he
	unbuttons his shirt, revealing adhesive tape swathed across
	his chest. Camera paces back as he winces when...

	MORRISSEY and AGOSTINI, the two investigators, rip the tape
	off his chest, retrieving a small tape recorder. Morrissey
	of the S.E.C. rewinds the cassette. We hear Gekko's voice
	being played back on the tape, the mention of their deals.

				MORRISSEY
		You did the right thing, Bud.

	Bud looks searchingly in the mirror. Faint CLICKING NOISE
	comes up over the shot.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	CLICKING of the Broad Tape grows LOUDER. Shots of Lou
	Mannheim, Lynch, Marv; silently looking up at the green
	fluorescent print-out.

	CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST CORPORATE RAIDER GORDON GEKKO AND

	Carl, dressed in a suit and tie, sits at the dining table,
	finished breakfast plates in front of him, refilling his
	coffee cup. Mom clearing off the table, anxious...

	As Bud walks in, wearing a suit and tie. He looks tired,
	beaten, the eyes lifeless, in a dark mood.

				MOM
			(disapproving)
		...don't wear that tie Buddy, it...

	She cuts off on Bud's look.

				CARL
		Another cup of coffee?

				BUD
		No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.

				CARL
			(checks his watch)
		I guess it's time to hit the road.

		Yeah, don't want to be late for my
		own funeral.

	Driving towards the Federal Courtrooms in Lower Manhattan.

				MOM
		...you helped save the airline and
		the people at the airline are gonna

				CARL
		...if I was you, I'd think about

		you...

				BUD
		Dad, I'm going to jail and you know
		it.

				CARL
			(shaking his head, sober)
		Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe
		so. It's gonna be rough on you but
		maybe in some screwed up way,
		that's the best thing that can
		happen to you...stop trading for
		the quick buck and go produce
		something with your life, create,
		don't live off the buying and
		selling of others...

				MOM
		...you can do it, Bud, once you set
		your mind to something, I believe
		you can do anything in the world...

	Bud stares ahead, registering it.

				CARL
			(nods, then)
		...got any friends gonna be there?

	As he pulls the car into the curb. The Federal Building, in
	approaching POV, looms large before them.

				BUD
			(looks around, ironic)
		Like who? Who really wants to know
		a convicted felon...I don't even
		like myself.

	Carl knows something Bud doesn't...

	Darien is standing there waiting as they approach the main
	entrance... Bud seeing her, suddenly stunned. His POV--
	easing along the curb.

				CARL
		So, why don't you get out here and
		go in with your friend, I'll park
		the car. Try to be cool, okay?

	A last look with his father.

	EXT. CURBSIDE - FEDERAL BUILDING - LOWER MANHATTAN - DAY

	Bud getting out...crossing to Darien. A pause.

			(nervous)
		Hi.

				BUD
		Why?

				DARIEN
		I figure a guy who's made some
		mistakes should be able to
		understand a girl who's made some
		of her own...

	Bud looking at her, moves closer, longing and hope and
	happiness have returned to his dull eyes... and forgiveness,
	the greatest of all.

	They embrace. Bud will never know about her past, nor need
	he. The camera leaving them on a slanting, circular crane,
	lifting past the Federal Building to a panorama of Wall
	Street in all its icy magisterial splendor...and thus ends
	our tale.

	EXT. WALL STREET - EARLY MORNING

	FADE IN. THE STREET. The most famous third of a mile in the
	world. Towering landmark structures nearly blot out the
	dreary grey flannel sky. The morning rush hour crowds swarm
	through the dark, narrow streets like mice in a maze, all in
	pursuit of one thing: MONEY... CREDITS RUN.

	INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - EARLY MORNING

	We hear the ROAR of the trains pulling out of the station.
	Blurred faces, bodies, suits, hats, attache cases float into
	view pressed like sardines against the sides of a door which
	now open, releasing an outward velocity of anger and greed,
	one of them BUD FOX.

	EXT. SUBWAY EXIT - MORNING

	The bubbling mass charges up the stairs. Steam rises from a
	grating, shapes merging into the crowd. Past the HOMELESS
	VETS, the insane BAG LADY with 12 cats and 20 shopping bags
	huddled in the corner of Trinity Church...

	Bud the Fox straggling behind, in a crumpled raincoat, tie
	askew, young, very young, his bleary face buried in a Wall
	Street Journal, folded, 'subway style', as he crosses the
	street against the light.

				BUD
		Why Fox? Why didn't you buy...
		schmuck?

	A car honks, swerving past.

	INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

	Cavernous modern lobby. Bodies cramming into elevators. Bud,
	stuffing the newspaper into his coat, jams in.

	INT. ELEVATOR - MORNING

	Blank faces stare ahead, each lost in private thoughts, Bud
	again mouthing the thought, "stupid schmuck", his eyes
	catching a blond executive who quickly flicks her eyes away.
	Paranoia in the elevator. We quickly cut into private lives.

				WORRIED MAN (V.O.)
		... he'll sue me, could be for 5-6
		million, and he'll get a million,
		the house, they'll impound my
		paychecks...damn, damn, why did I
		sign that contract?

				BLACK BIKE MESSENGER (V.O.)
		... gotta get Lola in the sack man,
		take her to the Garden for the
		Terrells, Jimmy give me the tickets
		for 12 bucks, I pull the midnight
		shift, I could do 60 bucks... wow,
		check those legs out...

	His eyes on the same blonde exec who looks away, self-
	conscious about her legs. The elevator stops at a floor,
	discards only one person. The doors close a little too slowly.

				BLONDE EXECUTIVE (V.O.)
		... jerk...
			(shifts her thoughts)
		call Hanratty. The decimal points
		on the code are uncalibrated.
		Hoskins. The signatures on the bank
		draft. Boyle, that
		bitch...insurance...tax form. Shit,
		talk to Kahn.
			(recalling)
		That's Hanratty, Hoskins, Bank,
		Boyle and Kahn... H2B2K - shoot,
		insurance and theatre
		tix...H2B2K,I,T -- and the cleaners!
		repeat...

	Catching the eyes of Bud Fox once again wandering to her.
	Camera moving to Bud who looks away.

				BUD (V.O.)
		...sorry, what a fox... funny, the
		most beautiful girls in the world
		are always on the street or in
		elevators, never get to talk to
		them, shy ... my looks, never had
		confidence in them ...
		overcompensating work syndrome...
		prove your worth with money...
		'cept I'm not making any money...
			(pause, the elevator
			at another floor, slow)
		... wonder what all these people
		are thinking about.

	Camera moving slowly again over the eyes. The silence of
	individual tension reigns over all.

				ANGRY MAN (V.O.)
		...Screw him! I'll destroy that
		sonufabitch... he thinks he can
		break a contract with me he's got
		something to learn.

				SECRETARY (V.O.)
		...9:15!... he'll kill me this
		time, he will really kill me... oh
		come on elevator!... why do you
		stop on every floor...

	As the elevator stops again to disgorge two people.

				BIKE MESSENGER (V.O.)
			(pissed now at the elevator)
		... come on man, time is money
		man... One floor here I could do
		eleven blocks...

				BLONDE EXECUTIVE (V.O.)
		H2B2K,I,T,CL,P,O,T2...
			(pause, she looks
			like she forgot something)


				WORRIED MAN (V.O.)
		...goddamn elevators!...people, too
		many goddamn people in this world!

	The elevator finally comes to a slow stop... They wait,
	plead, beg, screech with the eyes.

	The door at last opens. None of them acknowledging each
	other, they all stampede out the door with an audible gasp
	of release, a collective sign akin to making it to a urinal
	after a punishing wait...

	The elevator tension is over, but the killer grind continues.

	INT. JACKSON, STEINEM INVESTMENT HOUSE - DAY

	Credits continue to run. Bud moves past the functional
	reception area, past CAROLYN, a cheerful young black girl.

				CAROLYN
		How you doing Buddy?

				BUD
		Great Carolyn, doing any better
		would be a sin...

	He slips off his overcoat, flicks some lint off his Paul
	Stuart $500 suit, and enters the main trading room.

	Brokers mill by their desks, gulping coffee, scanning the
	papers, the quotrons. The digital clock by the big board
	counter clicks to 9:26 am -- four minutes until the market
	opens. You can smell the hunger.

	Bud takes a deep breath, tosses the newspaper away and
	struts into the office -- fuck it -- it's a new day.

	MOVING past DAN STEEPLES, a flush-faced old-timer, a blue
	and white Yale tie, with a carnation in his lapel.

				BUD
		Morning, Dan. What's looking good
		today?

				STEEPLES
		If I know I wouldn't be in this
		business. Get out while you're
		young, kid. I came here one day, I
		sat down, and look at me now.

	Past CHARLIE CUSHING, on the phone, a handsome chunk of man
	with rugged good looks and Ivy League mannerisms.

				BUD
		...hey Chuckie, how's the woman-
		slayer?

				CHARLIE
		...still looking for the right 18
		year old wife, how you doing, pal?

				BUD
		...if I had your looks, better.

				CHARLIE
			(used to it)
		...takes years of genetics, pal,
		and a Yale education... and the
		right tailor.

				BUD
		...not that you learned anything,
		Chunk.

	Bud reaches his trading desk, whips open his briefcase and
	pulls out a computer print-out of last night's homework.

				BUD
		I gotta feeling we're going to make
		a killing today, Marv.

				MARV (O.S.)
		Yeah, where's your machine gun.

				BUD
		Joke about it. I was up all night
		charting these stocks. You want to
		see this or what?

	His associate, MARVIN, a manicky wise-guy, swivels over his
	chair from a nearby desk. He gives the charts a quick read.

				MARV
			(scowling)
		Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got
		it all upside down.
			(confidential)
		Okay, I'm giving this to you and
		you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for
		you. Take the Knicks against the
		Bullets, and my pick of the day --
		Duke to beat the spread against
		Wake Forest.

				BUD
		Thanks, Marv, with that I might be
		able to qualify for welfare.

	LOU MANNHEIM, strolls in, a dignified looking older broker
	in his late 60's, wearing an old brown brim hat with button
	down white shirt, narrow tie, very much a picture from
	another era... a kind humor in his eyes... but obviously
	ailing in the legs and breath department.

				BUD
			(friendly)
		You got a look in your eye, Mr.
		Mannheim... You got something for
		the small fry...

				MANNHEIM
		Jesus, can't make a buck in this
		market, country's going to hell
		faster than when that sonofabitch
		Roosevelt was around... too much
		cheap money sloshing around the
		world. The biggest mistake we ever
		made was letting Nixon get off the
		gold standard. Putney Drug--you
		boys might want to have a look at it.

				MARV
		Take 5 years for that company to
		turn around.

				MANNHEIM
		...but they got a good new drug.
		Stick to the fundamentals, that's
		how IBM and Hilton were built...good
		things sometimes take time.

	The stentorian voice of OFFICE MANAGER HIERONYMUS LYNCH
	booms over the intercom.

	We see him peering from behind the glass partition in hit
	office; tall, balding with a perpetual worried look on his
	face.

				LYNCH
		Attention. Please. Office Production
		is down ten percent this week. I
		recommend that you all go through
		your clients' investments for any
		portfolio adjustments. And don't
		forget -- double commissions today
		on our 'A' or better bond funds.
			(looking in Bud and
			Marv's direction)
		Especially you rookies. Also,
		remember, the sales contest ends
		tomorrow.

	Bud and Marvin roll their eyes. The digital clock flashes
	9:30. The CREDITS close.

				BUD
		And they're off and running!

	The room rises to a subtle but new energy level with the
	clatter of the ticker, speakers, teletype machines,
	newsprinters' Dow Jones and Reuters, phones ringing off the
	hook. Brokers are shouting orders, running for tickets,
	dodging each other; it's a controlled riot.

				BROKERS
		Here's a hot lead... Have I got one
		for you.... sell ... dump it all!!
		... 500 at an eighth, an eighth!...
		July fifties. April thirties...how
		bout those Decembers? You see where
		they're going? ... Morgan is
		selling a billion one at the close.
		Yeah. That's right, they're selling
		all over the place... we're still
		long on the treasuries -- $110
		million. What about the Japs?
		...Where am I?
			(confused at all the
			phone lights)
		We gotta lot of lights here! Let's
		pick 'em up.

				BUD
			(on phone)
		Jack, take 50 Gulf, with a 3/8 top,
		forget the hundred. What about
		Delroy? I can go long at 23, let's
		go long...Conwest Air -- let me
		check it...

	He looks up at the TICKER... stock quotes whizzing by.

				BUD (O.S. CONT'D)
		Up an eighth. How many you want?
		It's on the floor.

	He writes the order up.

	A shot of CHARLIE CUSHING yawning as he half-listens to his
	customer, resting the phone on his kneecaps.

						DISSOLVE TO:

	THE CLOCK... It's 2.30 p.m. We hear the relentless clatter
	of the board ticker, and the drone of disembodied voices,
	blarihg market information out of squawk boxes.

	Bud's desk is now cluttered with order tickets, literature,
	crumpled notes, beverage cups and a half-eaten sandwich.
	He's on the phone and from the look on his face, the caller
	on the other end is breaking his balls. Marvin paces past,
	making a dramatic phone pitch.

				MARV
		Dr. Beltzer has to have his
		information this minute! It
		concerns his future!

	Bud waves Marvin away, answers his caller, trying to keep
	cool, worried how as he sees Lynch, the office manager,
	coming over.

				BUD
		Hey Howard, I thought you were a
		gentleman. Sure it's gone down a
		little bit, but you got the tip
		from your printer, I didn't... Yeah
		you did. That's what you said.
			(heated)
		I didn't tell you to buy it, why
		would I tell you to sell it?
			(screaming)
		No, I can't give it back! Give it
		back to who? You own it!
			(beat)
		No, he's out right now.

	As he looks up and winks at Lynch, standing over him.

				BUD
			(cupping the receiver)
		... That's what you told us to say.

				LYNCH
		Give me that phone.
			(takes receiver)
		Yes, sir, this is the manager. What
		seems to be the problem?

				MARV
			(into his phone)
		What?... Well, how was I to know
		you were in surgery? What am I
		Marvin the mind reader here?

	Bud whispers, tensely. Lynch listens.

				BUD
		He's lying.

				LYNCH
		Okay, sir. I'll discuss this with
		the broker and I'll get back to you.
		You're welcome.

	Lynce hangs up and glares at Bud.

				LYNCH
		If I'm closing out this account. If
		he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you
		pay for it.

				BUD
		Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!

				LYNCH
		Fox, you're making more problems
		than you are sales.

				BUD
		I don't think you're being fair,
		sir. You assigned me this guy, and
		you know he's got a history...

				LYNCH
		Somebody has to pay for that error.
		And it's not me.

	Lynch walks off. Bud does some quick calculations in his head.

				MARV
			(reappearing)
		Buddy, buddy, buddy; little
		trouble, huh, today.

				BUD
			(devastated)
		Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've
		got to cover his loss to the tune
		of about seven grand! I'm tapped
		out man, American Express got a hit
		man looking for me.

				MARV
		Hey, things could be worse. It
		could've been my money. Let me help
		you out, rookie.

	He takes out his wallet and loans Bud a hundred bucks.

				BUD
		Thanks Marv, I'll make it good to
		you.
			(fervently)
		You know what my dream is? One day
		to be on the other end of that
		phone...

				MARV
		Just put me on the institutional
		side of the room where the real
		cheesecake is. You forgetting
		something?

	Marvin points up at the clock. Bud looks up... it's 2:40.
	Bud quickly composes himself. He picks up the phone, dialing
	purposefully.

				MARV (CONT'D)
		Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize
		it's big game hunters that bag the
		elephants, not retail brokers. I
		heard this story about Gekko... he
		was on the phone 30 seconds after
		the Challenger blew up selling NASA
		stocks short.

				BUD
		Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's
		right, and you know everyday I say
		to myself, today could be the day...
		So what do you say... will you
		marry me? Then please can you get
		me through to Mr. Gekko?

				MARV
			(coaching)
		It concerns his future!

				BUD
		Of course he's busy, and so am I.
		Five minutes. That's all I'm asking.
		I know that if he could only hear
		what I have to say... it would
		change his life.

	INT. GEKKO OFFICE - DAY

	NATALIE, a classy attractive Englishwoman is on the phone
	with Bud, somewhat amused by his manner. She is the personal
	secretary to multimillionaire, Wall Street trader and
	raider, Gordon Gekko. His windows look out on a panoramic
	view of the city and East River.

				NATALIE
		Mr. Fox, I've told you before, I'm
		sure you're a good broker, but our
		traders talk to the brokers, Mr.
		Gekko only deals with investment
		bankers. Yes, I shall give him your
		message ...

	As they're speaking, another SECRETARY leads two well-heeled
	JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN past her desk. As she opens the door to
	the inner office and ushers them inside, we catch a glimpse
	of a figure, pacing back and forth, talking animatedly on
	the phone by the huge corner window. HE IS GORDON GEKKO. We
	hear a deafening ROAR as we:

						DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. MCGREGOR'S BAR AND GRILL - NEAR LAGUARDIA AIRPORT -
	TWILIGHT

	In the background, a 747 ascends into the night sky,
	climbing over the roof tops of weathered brick tract houses.
	Bud, coat collar pulled up against the wind, crosses the
	street, entering a neighborhood bar. We see an old maroon
	Honda behind him.

	INT. MCGREGOR'S - TWILIGHT

	Dimly-lit, noisy, blue-collar airline bar. Machinists and
	mechanics still in their overalls at the bar, drinking,
	watching ESPN FIGHT NIGHT, on TV. Bud searches the crowd. A
	group of middle-aged men wave him over, BLUESTAR AIRLINES
	insignias on the pockets... CHARLIE DENT, a rugged, chain-
	smoking ex-Marine Sergeant, and DOMINICK AMATO, a big strong
	Italian greet Buddy as he comes over.

				CHARLIE
		Buddy boy, how ya doing?

				BUD
		Great Charlie, any better it'd be a
		sin.

				AMATO
			(slapping Bud)
		I hear all you guys on Wall Street
		are millionaires, when you gonna
		make us rich?

				BUD
		Gotta open an account to win the
		lottery, Dominick. Give me 15,000,
		you'll have a condo in Florida next
		Christmas.

				CARL
		... sure and we'll own the airline.
		If he makes anybody rich, let him
		make himself rich, so's he can pay
		off his school loans.

	As he signs an unemployment insurance form for one of his men.

				BUD
		... nice to see you in such a good
		mood Dad, what'd Mom do, give you
		fish for dinner? ... You're smoking
		too much, how many times do you
		gotta go to the hospital to ...

	Carl, inhaling his cigarette, grimaces formidably,
	terminating the subject.

				CARL
		...leave me alone willya. Only
		thing makes me feel good anymore.
		Spaghetti. She makes lousy
		spaghetti...

				BUD
		It's called pasta now Dad,
		spaghetti's out of date.

	Bud sitting down next to him, pats him around the shoulder.
	Dad, a sarcastic and gruff edge to him, makes a faint smile.
	He has a genuine affection and pride in his somewhat
	glamorous son.

				CARL
		... so am I. Whaddaya want, a beer?
			(to waitress)
		Hey Billie, bring another for the
		kid, he looks good, doesn't he?

	Dominick and Charlie go off. A pause. Father and son sizing
	each other up with a look.

				CARL
		... looks like you grown another
		inch... but you don't look so hot,
		getting bags under your eyes,
		starting to look old like me.

				BUD
		Ah, I had a tough day. Some jerk
		D.K'd me and I gotta cover his loss.

				CARL
		Speak English will ya.

				BUD
		D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was
		when the options he bought took a
		bath. He reneged on me.

				CARL
			(nods, satisfied)
		I told you not to go into that
		racket. You could've been a doctor
		or a lawyer,

				BUD
		Coulda been a contender.

				CARL (CONT.)
		you coulda stayed at Bluestar and
		been a supervisor in instead of
		going customer relations by now,
		'stead of going off and bein' a
		salesman.

				BUD
			(an old story between them)
		Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How
		many times I gotta tell you I'm an
		account executive, and pretty soon
		I'm going to the investment banking
		side of the firm.

				CARL
		You get on the phone and ask
		strangers for their money, right?
		You're a salesman.
	 
			BUD
			(ticked)
		Dad, it takes time. You gotta build
		a customer list. I'm doing it. I
		could make more money in one year
		as a broker than five years at the
		airline.

				CARL
		I don't get it, you get a
		scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000
		the first year, and 50 last year,
		where the hell is it?

				BUD
		50 K don't get you to first base in
		the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I
		pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of
		15,000, I got school loans, car
		loans, food, park my car costs me 3
		bills a month, I need good suits,
		that's $500 a pop, shoes...

				CARL
		So come home and live rent free,
		'stead of that cockroach palace you
		live in. $50,000 Jesus Christ, the
		world is off its rocker. I made
		$37,000 last year and you...

				BUD
		It's Queens, Dad and a 5% mortgage
		and you rent the top room--I gotta
		live in Manhattan to be a player,
		Dad. There's no nobility in poverty
		anymore, y'know. One day you're
		going to be proud of me, you'll
		see...
			(hurting)

				CARL
			(sees it)
		It's yourself you've got to be
		proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya
		need?

				BUD
			(beat)
		Can you spare three hundred? Pay
		you back next month, promise.

	Dad reaches into his pocket, looks at his cash. It hurts.
	 
			CARL
		...Got a 100 on me, you...

				BUD
			(embarrassed)
		Not in here Dad... please. Later.

	Dad shrugs, puts it away.

				CARL
		... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200
		there. Your brother never...
			(cuts off when he
			sees Buddy's face)
		...well, I always said money is
		something you need in case you
		don't die tomorrow...

				BUD
			(changes subject)
		How's Mom?

	Another man comes over with a bandage around his head and a
	compensation form for Carl to sign. ("Hey, chief").

				CARL
			(with affection)
		...same, pain in the ass, god bless
		her, talks too much... gonna take
		her to Florida next month... west
		coast, near Tampa, like to get out
		for good, but can't afford it.

				BUD
		...Work okay?

				CARL
			(lights another
			cigarette, grimaces)
		...this drug testing is driving my
		guys nuts. I got flagged for my
		blood pressure pills. The only good
		news is, we just met with the
		comptroller over some union
		stuff...'member that crash last
		summer? and the investigation?
		Well, the FAA is gonna rule it was
		a manufacturing flaw in the door
		latch mechanism. I kept telling 'em
		it wasn't maintenance, it was those
		goddamn greedy manufacturers out in
		Cincinnati. And I was right.

	He gives the signed form back to the injured man. (Carl:
	"Okay, Frank")

				BUD
		That's great Dad.

				CARL
		Damn right, it gets us out from
		under suspension. We'll get those
		new routes to Pittsburgh and Boston
		and the equipment we need. We're
		gonna compete with the big boys now.

				BUD
			(boasts)
		Hey to Bluestar, as your broker all
		I can advise is hold on to that
		stock Dad...

	They drink. Bud reflects a moment.

				BUD
		You sure about this FAA announcement?

				CARL
		About what?

				BUD
		The FAA announcement.

				CARL
		Sure I'm sure. Buddy, you got that
		mischievous look in your eyes. You
		used to smile just like that when
		you were a baby sleeping, just like
		that.

	Bud's mind racing elsewhere.

	INT. BUD'S APARTMENT - UPPER WEST SIDE - NIGHT

	A cramped studio facing an air shaft with bars on the window.
	Moving across to the sound of the radio alarm going off and
	the glib tones of a rock D.J. announcing the Met's latest
	streak ... The walls are papered with stock analyses and
	graphs, print out pages strewn across the floor. No other
	semblance of a personal life except clothes haphazardly
	tossed, Barron's and Fortune magazines. A GIRL's back is all
	we see, sleeping naked on the bed.

	Close on Bud's IBM computer -- his appointment calendar. Bud
	focusing on an underlined notation: G.G.'s BIRTHDAY.

	Bud stares at the clock: 4 a.m. He picks up a prospectus for
	a chemical company, starts reading.

	EXT. GEKKO BUILDING - MORNING

	Bud, crossing lower Broadway, enters a magnificent towering
	glass structure.

	INT. GORDON GEKKO PENTHOUSE OFFICES - MORNING

	NATALIE, Gekko's British secretary, is completing shorthand
	notes as the intercom buzzes. A logo for "GEKKO & CO. is
	behind her.

				RECEPTION
			(off)
		... I have a delivery here for Mr.
		Gekko. It's a personal item and the
		gentleman says you have to sign for
		it.

				NATALIE
			(frowning)
		...all right, send him in...

	INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

	Bud, somewhat nervous, is led down an impressive hallway
	hung with expensive modern art... past a huge Calder mobile
	and a pool of some 15 traders on phones, quotron terminals
	and keyboards... into Natalie's outer office.

				BUD
		Hello, Natalie, you recognize the
		voice? I'll give you a hint, you're
		thinking seriously about marrying
		me...

				NATALIE
			(recognizing the voice)
		What are you doing here?

				BUD
		...And you're even lovelier than I
		pictured. I brought a birthday
		present for Mr. Gekko.

				NATALIE
		First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't
		just come barging in here. And what
		makes you think it's his birthday?

	Bud takes out an old crumpled Fortune magazine cover of
	Gordon Gekko, entitled "Gekko the Great!"

				BUD
		It's in the bible, see. You better
		go buy him a present. Please,
		Natalie. Let me give him the gift;
		Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his
		favorite and hard to get.

				NATALIE
			(sighs)
		Stay here, I'll see what I can do.

	She takes the gift and enters Gekko's office. Bud paces
	nervously. Natalie re-appears, stern, but a note of
	compromise in her voice.

				NATALIE
		Wait outside.

	INT. GEKKO OFFICES - OUTSIDE RECEPTION AREA - DAY

	Bud on the courtesy phone, hangs up, looks nervously at his
	watch. Almost 12. He's lost some two hours of business.
	Natalie suddenly comes out, without a smile.

				NATALIE
		Five minutes...

	Bud brightens, pumping himself in the mirror, muttering.

				BUD
			(to Natalie)
		Well... life all comes down to a
		few moments, and this is one of 'em...

	He follows Natalie.

	INT. GORDON GEKKO'S OFFICE (BUD'S POV) - DAY

	Furnishings in hypermodern gray and black lacquer, Modern
	Art ranging from black field paintings by Ad Reinhardt to
	the smashed dishes of Julian Schnabel. Nautilus equipment,
	hi-tech gadgets are in evidence, including a splendid Howard
	Miller World Time Clock, and a world map...

	Three of Gekko's people, young MBA's dressed for success,
	are scattered about the room, on phones, calculators, coming
	in and out.

	GORDON GEKKO aka Gekko the Great as the media calls him,
	dressed in a custom English suit, paces on the phone with
	the restlessness of a caged tiger, a 50-foot extension cord
	attached to his blinking 130 line silver-plated telephone.
	On his ears is a headset.

	He is carrying on overlapping conversations with a myriad of
	bankers, partners and lawyers; pausing to issue commands to
	his aides while keeping his eye on the stock prides spitting
	across a bank of quotron monitors, carrying everything from
	New York Exchanges to London, commodities, gold, and
	currency values. A second Secretary and sometimes Natalie
	exit and enter with various messages written on a piece of
	paper, indicating a waiting party on the phone. Gekko often
	shakes his head "no".

				GEKKO
			(on phone)
		... what the hell is going on? I
		just saw 200,000 shares move, are
		we part of it, we better be, pal,
		or I'm gonna eat your lunch for
		you... get on 1.
			(switches lines)
		Sorry, love it at forty. It's an
		insult at fifty. Their analysts
		don't know preferred stock from
		livestock...
			(a beat, mischievous smile)
		wait for it to head south, then
		we'll raise the sperm count on the
		deal... right. Get back to me....
			(to Alex, an aide
			listening an the
			other line)
		This is the kid that's called me 59
		days in a row. Wants to be a player
			(to Bud)
		There oughta be a picture of you in
		the dictionary under persistence.
			(back to phone)
		Look, Jerry, I'm looking for
		negative control, no more than 30
		to 35%, just enouqh to block
		anybody else's merger plans and
		find out from the inside if the
		books are cooked. If it looks as
		good as on paper, we're in the kill
		zone. We lock and load pal...get on 3.

	ALEX DE BETANCOURT, a tall handsome Frenchman, jots a note
	and follows Gordon over to line 3. Gekko's dark intent eyes
	fixing briefly on Bud who stands waiting in the corner. He
	motions him to sit.

				GEKKO
			(new line)
		Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?...
		No, not interested.
			(eyes an Quotron, to
			Ollie, a trader)
		Ollie, start calling a the
		institutions, start with Marx at
		Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me
		that California retirement money,
		baby! And we're on our way!

				OLLIE
		You got it, G.G.

	OLLIE, a gigantic 200 pound man wearing pink suspenders,
	rises and walks to another phone, past Bud...

				GEKKO
			(back on line with
			Billy, listening)
		... check the arbs for MacDonald's.
		Yeah, I'm having a Mac attack.
		20,000 shares. For about 30 minutes.
		Lunch? Are you joking -- lunch is
		for wimps. Get back to me...
			(to Alex)
		4.

	Bud's eyes on the framed "tombstones" from the Wall Street
	Journal commemorating Gekko's successful deals; they hang
	like scalps from the walls. Gekko's eyes drifting to Bud, a
	friendly easy smile for a flick of an instant, he has
	genuine charm in his manner and though ultrafast verbally,
	projects calm and confidence at the center. A man who
	obviously loves what he does, to some small degree is
	flashing his stuff for the outsider.

				GEKKO
			(line 4)
		Look Harold, they're vulnerable,
		alright, but we don't want 'em to
		think they're under accumulation.
		Go slow. Call Geneva and the
		Bahamas for me, will ya? We feint
		towards it but we wait...

				ALEX
		What about tipping off Yurovich?

				GEKKO
			(grimaces)
		If I ever need surgery, get me the
		heart of an arb like Yurovich, it's
		never been used...Happy Holideals
		Harold...

	Hangs up, eyes to Bud. His headset comes off.

				BUD
			(nervous)
		How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox.

				GEKKO
		So you say. Nice to meet you; hope
		you're intelligent. Like these,
		how'd you get these?
			(indicating cigars)


				BUD
			(tries a smile, awkward)
		...got a connection at the airport.

	Gekko notes the answer, wrapping the cuff of a state-of-the-
	art, automatic blood pressure monitor around his arm and
	starts pumping it up. His aides continue on the phones.

				GEKKO
		So what s on your mind kimosabe?
		Why am I listening to you? Got to
		monitor my blood pressure, so
		whatever you do, don't upset me.

				BUD
		Oh no, no...

				GEKKO
			(demonstrating it)
		Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor
		computes your systolic and
		diastolic pressure. Has an LCD
		readout, and it's cost effective --
		less than one visit to the doctor.

				BUD
		I just want to let you know Mr.
		Gekko I read all about you at NYU
		Business, and I think you're an
		incredible genius and I've always
		dreamed of only one thing -- to do
		business with a man like you...

				GEKKO
			(smiles, impatient
			with the speech)
		So what firm you with, pal?

				BUD
		Jackson, Steinem...

				GEKKO
			(nods)
		...going places, good junk bond
		department, you got the financing
		on that Syndicam deal.

				BUD
		...Yeah, and we're working on some
		other interesting stuff.

				GEKKO
			(fishing)
		...A cosmetics company by any
		chance? What are you, the 12th man
		on the deal team? The last to know?

				BUD
			(smiles)
		Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.

				GEKKO
		So whatta you got for me, sport?
		Why are you here?

	Bud opens his attache case and rifles out a handful of
	briefs. Gekko noting the blood pressure reading and taking
	the cuff off his arm. Ollie, the big trader, ambles back in,
	says something to the third aide, a young intelligent-
	looking woman SUSAN TURNER.

				BUD
		Chart break-out on this one
		here...uh Whitewood-Young
		Industries...low P.E. Explosive
		earnings. 30% discount from book.
		Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders.
		Strong management.

				GEKKO
		It's a dog, what else you got,
		sport, besides connections at the
		airport?

				NATALIE
		Mr. Stevenson in San Fransisco.

	Gekko takes the call, cutting Bud off.

				GEKKO
		He respond to the offer? What? What
		the hell's Cromwell doing giving
		lecture tours when his company's
		losing 60 million a quarter? I
		guess he's giving lectures on how
		to lose money...if this guy opened
		a funeral parlor, no one would die,
		this turkey's totally brain
		dead...Well Christmas is over and
		business is business.
			(simultaneous to Ollie)
		Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch.
		Ollie I want every orifice in his
		body flowing red.

				OLLIE
			(laughs, on the phone)
		He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake.

	Gekko hanging up and buzzing an aide. Throws out an aside to
	Bud.

				GEKKO
		...doesn't look like it but the
		best trader on the street...
			(to Susan)
		Sue get the LBO analysis on Teldar
		Paper and bring it here...what else?

	Bud shifting, uncomfortable as Gekko finally swivels his
	attention back to him.

				BUD
			(coming right back)
		Tarafly...Analysts don't like it. I
		do. The breakup value is twice the
		market price. The deal finances
		itself. Sell off two divisions,
		keep...

	Aiex, knowing the stock, sneers, shares a look with Gekko
	who looks up at Bud with the first sign of interest.

				GEKKO
			(laughs)
		Not bad for a quant, but a dog with
		different fleas.
			(checks his hi-tech watch)
		Come on, tell me something I don't
		know. It's my birthday, pal,
		surprise me...

	As he opens a birthday card and feeds it into the SHREDDER
	that sits next to his desk over the waste basket. The sound
	it makes is soft and menacing. Buddy knows its fourth down
	and long, Gekko's attention is shifting to the quotron. In
	frustration, Bud blurts it out.

				BUD
			(standing)
		Bluestar Airlines.

	The camera moves on him now, sudden, more intense, in a
	sense trapping him.

				GEKKO
		...rings a bell somewhere. So what?

				BUD
		A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300
		pilots, flies northeast, Canada,
		some Florida and Caribbean routes...
		great slots in major cities...

				GEKKO
		...don't like airlines, lousy
		unions...

				BUD
		There was a crash last year. They
		just got a favorable ruling on a
		lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't
		know.

	Gekko looks up, remotely interested.

				GEKKO
		How do you know?

				BUD
			(hesitates, concerned)
		I know...the decision'll clear the
		way for new planes and route
		contracts. There's only a small
		float out there, so you should grab
		it. Good for a five point pop.

	Ollie comes back in, as excited as he ever will get under
	his rolls of flesh, his voice deadpan.

				OLLIE
		... just got 250,000 shares at 18
		1/4 from Janson, think I'll pull
		twice that at 18 1/2 outta the
		California pensions. We got close
		to half a million shares in the bag.

				GEKKO
		Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away
		Ollie.

				OLLIE
		And, I'm pretty sure we got the
		Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming
		in with us and I'm working on the
		Silverberg boys in Canada.

				GEKKO
		Rip their throats out and put them
		in your garbage compactor.
			(to Bud)
		Interesting. You got a card?

	Buddy thrusts a card into his hands. Gekko glances at it.

				BUD
		My home number's on the back...

				GEKKO
			(smiles, looks at card)
		Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas
		a day. I choose one.

	Bud stuffs his notes back into the briefcase, hoping for a
	word of encouragement in the awkward silence.

				BUD
		Well, hope to hear from you, sir.

	He turns and heads out the door, still shaken by the
	revelation he has made passing Susan who hurries in with a
	dossier.

	Gekko glances at it. As Bud leaves, he overhears:

				GEKKO
			(off)
		OK gang, looks like we're going
		over 5% in Teldar, start the
		lawyers on a tender offer and 13D,
		we keep going after everything in
		sight but don't pay over $22.
		They're gonna fight, they got Myers
		and Thromberg doing their legal,
		they make Nazis look like nice guys...

	INT. OUTSIDE GEKKO'S OFFICE - DAY

	Bud walks glumly past Natalie, certain that he's blown it.
	She's busy on the phone.

				BUD
		...thanks Natalie.

				NATALIE
			(buzzing inside, preoccupied)
		...have a nice day Mr. Stone.
			(wrong name, doesn't
			notice, to Gekko on phone)
		... Mr. Gekko, the conference call
		is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr.
		Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in
		Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms.
		Rosco in London. They're all on.

	The phone call goes behind closed doors. Bud walks out,
	dejected.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	Bud comes in, distracted, punches into his quatron. Teldar
	Paper comes up.

				MARV
			(comes over)
		...well, see him?

				BUD
			(mind on the computer)
		Yeah, but he didn't see me.

				MARV
		Cheer up buddy buddy. You shook
		Gekko the Great's hand and you
		still got all your fingers. He's
		not the only elephant in the jungle.

	INSERT: TELDAR PAPER. The quotron. Bud's eyes. Thinking to buy.

				MARV
			(looks)
		... got something from him? Teldar
		Paper?

	Bud wipes it off the screen, his mind made up, dismissing
	the temptation to buy.

				BUD
		...a dog with fleas.

	Lynch, the manager, stalks past with some telexes.

				LYNCH
		Where you been the last 3 hours,
		Fox? I wouldn't be sitting around
		chin wagging if I were you...
		plenty of names in that phone book
		to cold call...

	Marvin gives Lynch the Italian salute, behind his back.
	Grudgingly, Buddy flips open the massive New York phone book.

				MARV
		...got tickets for the Knicks
		tonight. Go out and cruise some
		bimbos afterwards, whaddaya say?

				BUD
			(shakes his head)
		...gotta read my reports.

				MARV
		Forget charts! We're not fund
		managers, Bud, churn 'em and burn
		'em. I'm offering you the Knicks
		and chicks. God save you before you
		turn into poor Steeples over there.

	Their eyes briefly on DAN STEEPLES, red faced, desperately
	trying to make a sale on the telephone, hangs up defeated.

				BUD
		...preferably Lou Mannheim...

	Their eyes briefly on LOU MANNHEIM, in his private office,
	sitting there slumped, thinking, smoking as he watches the
	quotron.

				MARV
		Nice guy but a loser. Lost all his
		equity when his firm went belly up
		in the recession of 71. you wanna
		be coming in here in your late
		sixties still pitching? ...
		Whatever happened to that cute
		analyst at Thudder, Wicks? ...
		Cindy? Susan?

				BUD
		Cindy. Having sex with her is like
		reading the Wall Street Journal
		'cept the Journal don't talk back.
		'Sides this AIDS crap is ruining
		romance, nobody trusts anybody
		anymore, gotta get a blood test in
		the toilet before you leave a bar
		together, somebody oughtta invent
		an AIDS dipstick, no kidding, make
		a fortune. I gotta get to work...
		Z's today.
			(hitting the phone
			with the directory)

	The pool SECRETARY, GINA, calls out.

				GINA
		Call for you Buddy.

				BUD
			(taking it)
		Bud Fox.

	Bud rears up in his seat. A change. Marvin notices.

	INT. GORDON GEKKO OFFICE - SIMULTANEOUS - DAY

	Gekko talks into his speaker phone, gazing out the window.

				GEKKO
		Alright Bud Fox... buy me twenty
		thousand shares of Bluestar. No
		more than 15 1/8, 3/8 tops, and
		don't screw it up sport.

	INT. BUD'S CUBICLE - DAY

	The camera tracks around and in on him climactically as the
	Music Theme rises to ensnare him... We end close on Bud.
	Dumbstruck.

				BUD
		Yes, sir. Thank you. You won't
		regret it.

	He hangs up, stunned still, rises from his chair, unbuttons
	his collar and feverishly starts writing the ticket.

				MARV
		Got a little action there, eh buddy?

				BUD
		Marv,
			(turns triumphant)
		...I just bagged the elephant!

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - NIGHT

	The upper West Side. The young, the rich and the restless
	parade along the avenue, jamming the neighborhood restaurants
	and bars. Bud glides along, feeling a part of the crowd now,
	past a dreadlocked DERELICT swigging Thunderbird and
	shouting obscenities, shaking a wooden African spear.

	INT. RESTAURANT/BAR - NIGHT

	Inside a glitzy neighborhood singles bar in which Bud stops,
	everybody seems to be young and drinking margueritas. Bud
	orders a beer, surveying the room like a veteran, overhearing
	the conversation of a YOUNG TRADER to two other broker types.

				YOUNG TRADER
		...you know Marty Wyndham? He
		netted $650,000 out of that
		merger...26 years old, the guy's
		Rambo. Got himself a Porsche Turbo
		Cabriolet about 75 thou, got a
		house in Westhampton, penthouse on
		Second Avenue, gets up at 2:30 in
		the morning, he's in the office at
		4...guy never sleeps...Rambo genes...

	He blathers on as Bud surveys the room, noticing an ELEGANT
	BLONDE with a striking aloof beauty, very much the debutante
	dream Grace Kelly type, so refined that you wonder what she
	could possibly be doing out at night in public alone.

	Bud summons his courage, catches his breath, makes his way
	over... She sees him approach, obviously doesn't wish to
	talk, eyes darting elsewhere like a nervous deer.

				BUD
			(awkward)
		Hi...can I buy you a drink? I'm
		celebrating tonight.

				BLONDE
			(disdainful)
		Please, no thanks...
			(looking away)

				BUD
		Look, I know you get approached a
		lot by dubious men, but I'm
		different, I never talk to
		strangers, all my life I've been
		waiting for the right person to
		walk across the room...
		you're that person, you don't know
		it but I do and if you walk away
		now I'll never see you again or you
		me. You'll grow old.

				BLONDE
		Oh really.

				BUD (CONT'D)
		I'll grow old. We'll both die. And
		we'll never have known each other.
		That's sad. At least one drink for
		a dreamer...What's your favorite
		drink?

	She looks at him, not quite sure. Is he serious or glib?

				BLONDE
			(uncommitted)
		Grand Marnier.

				BUD
		Sounds like a french word, what is it?

				BLONDE
		It's a romantic and tragic drink.

				BUD
		Sounds tempting. I prefer mine with
		a twist of fate. You know like us
		meeting. Don't go away...

	Maybe, just maybe she's his! His eyes show it as he hurries
	back to the bar to order. As he gets the bartender's
	attention, he turns and sees that she is joined by a MAN who
	looks as if he stepped out of the pages of GQ. Together they
	walk away. Stung, Bud watches as the woman of his dreams
	disappears out the door.

				BARTENDER
		What do you want?

				BUD
		...I just lost it.

	EXT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT (RAIN)

	Bud and a DATE he's obviously just picked up, are struggling
	to be seen in a mass of people trying to get in the hottest
	new club in Manhattan. Bud easing forward along the ropes to
	a large BOUNCER who roughly pushes one of the bridge-and-
	tunnel kids back across the rope.

	Joe discreetly shows him $50 but they guy says: "No room!,"
	humiliating him in front of his date. The bouncer shoving
	Bud aside as Gordon Gekko and KATE, his wife, and ENTOURAGE
	(ALEX, others) are shown through the ropes into the door.
	Bud says something to Gordon but it gets lost in the confusion.

	EXT. 79TH STREET & BROADWAY - EARLY DAY

	People pouring into the subway on the way to work. Bud
	rifles through the Financial Times he's just bought at the
	newsstand and finds the article he was looking for: BLUESTAR
	EXONERATED IN 1984 CRASH. He thrusts his fist in the air,
	victoriously...bounds down the subway stairs.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	Bud's on the quotron and the phone; the word's spread around
	the office, he's landed Gekko and brokers drop by his desk
	to get the lowdown.

				BUD
			(on the phone)
		What's it at now? Still moving. Great!

				STEEPLES
		The man of the day. Pour some water
		on him to cool him off...one of
		these days I want to know how you
		got Gekko's account.

				BUD
			(indicating Dan's
			Yale tie)
		My magic tie, Dan.

				STEEPLES
		I'll trade you.

	Lou Mannheim and a Chinese LADY BROKER intersect.

				CHINESE LADY
		Gordo the Great, way to go.

				MANNHEIM
			(pleased)
		Good little company. I remember
		when we got the money for Bluestar
		to build those first planes, back
		in the fifties.

				CHINESE LADY
			(to Bud)
		I hear you're buying Teldar.

	Bud smiles back at her mischievously.

				BUD
		Sleep with me and the secrets of
		the West are yours.

				MANNHEIM
		Now that's a crap company, sure
		you'll make money on the takeover
		rumor, but what's being created.
		Nothing. No substance behind it.

				BUD
			(succinct)
		Old values. Buy.

	She hears him. As they go, Marvin swivels madly over in his
	chair.

				MARV
		Buddy, buddy, some buddy; why
		didn't you tell me to buy Bluestar.

				BUD
		Hey Marv, he demanded
		confidentiality...

				MARV
		Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar
		Airlines yesterday. Today they just
		happen to get good news and the
		stock goes bat shit. You must have
		ESP. A real Nostradamus.
			(Bud ignoring him,
			picking up the phone)
		Jesus Christ, what are friends for?

				BUD
		All right, I owe you one Marv.

				MARV
		That's right, next time a little
		birdie talks to you, talk to me too
		E.F. Hutton.

				GINA
			(pool secretary)
		Buddy, phone...Gordon Gekko!

	Everybody in the adjacent area turns and looks at Buddy like
	in an E.F. Hutton commercial.

				BUD
			(on phone)
		Hi Natalie...lunch at 21?
			(looks at watch)
		I'm out the door...

	As he springs up to leave, Lynch the manager happens to be
	strolling by. He nods pleasantly at Buddy.

				LYNCH
		Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't
		you join me and the partners for
		lunch tomorrow in the dining room?

				BUD
		I'd love to, Mr. Lynch, thank you.

	INT. 21 CLUB - DAY

	Dark mahagony wood, plush banquettes, a long oak bar. Bud
	enters the main dining room in a relatively outre suit that
	hangs on him embarrassingly as other businessmen in well-cut
	suits move around him and a Maitre d' sniffs, then leads him
	to where Gekko is parked, finishing up his lunch. A half
	finished plate is removed to make way for Bud.

				GEKKO
		Hi sport.

				BUD
			(still nervous)
		Nice to see you again Mr. Gekko.

	He's seated.

				GEKKO
		Try the steak tartare. It's off the
		menu but Louis'll make it for you...

				MAITRE D'
		Of course sir. And to drink?

	He looks at Gekko's bottled water.

				BUD
		Uh...just a Evian, thank you...

	The Maitre d' leaves. Gekko proudly pulls a tiny 3" by 6"
	color television out of his pocket with a 2" diagonal
	screen, flips it on to the Dow Jones avarages.

				GEKKO
		See this? Can you believe it? Two
		inch screen...

				BUD
		...I can't even see it...

				GEKKO
		...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old,
		electronics freak, got a liquid
		crystal display 'stead of an
		electronic beam. We're going into a
		new age pal. So how's business today.

				BUD
		Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth
		when I left the office. It might
		spin up to 25 by the bell...

				GEKKO
			(a tiny smile)
		Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for
		yourself? Bet you were on the phone
		two minutes after you got out of my
		office.

				BUD
			(flushes)
		No sir, that would've been illegal...

				GEKKO
			(doesn't believe him)
		Sure...relax sport, no one's gonna
		blow a whistle. Here, is this
		legal?...you wanna put it in my
		account?

	As he fishes a check out and drops it on Bud's plate.

	Greeting TWO BANKERS who stop at the table as Bud picks up
	the check, glances at it. His hand starts to tremble.

	The check is for $500,000.

				GEKKO
			(to bus boy, the
			bankers excited)
		Can we have the check over here for
		christ's sake.

				BUS BOY
			(rushing off)
		Yes sir!

				GEKKO
		Cover the Bluestar buy and put a
		couple hundred thou in one of those
		bow-wow stocks you mentioned. Pick
		the dog with the least fleas. Use a
		stop loss so your downside is
		50,000, and buy yourself a decent
		suit. You can't come in here
		looking like that.
			(Bud flushes, embarassed)
		Go to Morty Sills, Tell 'em I sent
		you.

				BUD
			(his genuine look)
		Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the
		chance. You won't regret this,
		you're with a winner.

				GEKKO
			(paying the check
			with cash)
		...put the rest of it in a money
		market account for now. I want to
		see what you know before I invest
		it...and save the cheap salesman
		talk, it's obvious.

				BUD
			(stung)
		Excuse me sir.

	Gekko rising to leave, the Maitre d' hovering around.

				GEKKO
		You heard me...I don't like losses
		sport. Nothing ruins my day more
		than losses... You do good, you get
		perks, all kinds of perks. Stay
		home tonight. Louis, take care of
		'im. Enjoy the lunch.

	Confused, Bud watches Gekko walk out of the room, pumping
	extended hands left and right. He holds the cashiers check
	up to his eyes, entranced by it, like a kid with his first
	dollar...as the raw steak tartare with an egg on top is put
	in front of him.

	INT. BUD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Bud is at his computer when the door bell rings. He's not
	expecting a visitor. When he opens the door he is knocked
	for a loop.

	A smashing looking LADY in a fitted Chanel suit, ropes of
	chains, short tight skirt, beautiful long legs, is standing
	there. Taking in the apartment, she hides her distaste.

				LISA
		Hello Bud, I'm Lisa, a friend of
		Gordon's.

				BUD
			(in a daze)
		Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure.
		Would you, uh, like to come in?

				LISA
		Didn't he tell you?
			(sighs)
		That's so like Gordon. Get dressed,
		we're going out.

				BUD
		We are?

	EXT. BUD'S BUILDING - NIGHT

	A stretch limo is parked in front, neighborhood WINOS
	inspecting it. The CHAUFFEUR opens the back door, as Lisa
	steps inside, Buddy in tow. The winos clap, howling at her.

	INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

	Bud in the back seat next to Lisa, gazes out the black
	tinted window as they drive away, then turns to her as she
	gives him a bottle of Champagne to open.

				BUD
		So, where are we going?

				LISA
		Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the
		River Cafe...or maybe we can just
		drive around for a while.
			(provocatively)
		Work up an appetite.

	She crosses her legs. Bud's eyes moving south. He pops the
	cork. Lisa does a little blow, offers him.

				LISA
		Want some?
			(he shorts)
		Gordon tells me you're a very
		talented broker. What do you like?

				BUD
			(feeling the rush)
		Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...

				LISA
		I got this guy who should know
		tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I
		been burned on tips. What do you
		think Bud?

				BUD
		Let's see, it closed at uh, 41
		1/8...
			(his voice cracking)
		Up a quarter...very attractive...
		about average yield...

	She unzips his fly.

				BUD
		Rising profits...strong balance
		sheets, good earnings per share.

				LISA
			(removing her blouse)
		So you're hot on this stock?

				BUD
			(nods, moaning)
		It's ready to take off. I'd jump
		all over it if I were you.

	As she pulls up her skirt and climbs on top of Buddy.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - MORNING

	Buddy, in an obviously new Mort Sills suit, struts past
	Carolyn at the reception desk, in high spirits.

				CAROLYN
			(smiles)
		Morning Buddy, you look happy.

				BUD
		Any better and I'd be guilty.

				CAROLYN
			(picking up the flow)
		You were never that innocent sugarpie.

				BUD
			(coyly)
		...how do you know? You wish...

						WIPE TO:

	Bud on the phone, gazing at the ticker, concern in his eyes.
	CLICKING of the tape ticker comes up over the music. He
	looks at Marv.

						WIPE TO:

	Later. Research reports piling up. Bud's secretary trying to
	get his attention. Bud's concern growing, as the green
	fluorescent numbers spit across the board. CLICKER growing
	louder. Pan to Marvin, hands cupped in prayer. To Dan
	Steeples who closes his eyes and shakes his head.

						WIPE TO:

	Close. Bud watching the tape -- dizzying, hypnotic blur of
	numbers. The roar of the clicker, drowning out the music...a
	runaway freight train.

						WIPE TO:

	Bud's hands clamped over his eyes. The numbers stop. Noise
	recedes. He opens his eyes, looks down at his desk, stacked
	with reports and phone messages, as the pool secretary,
	GINA, calls out. Marvin glumly coasts over in his chair.

				MARV
		Boy, we sure went down the toilet
		on that ugly bitch. If we were
		Japs, we'd have to stay with our
		aircraft.

				GINA
			(calls out)
		Mr. Gekko's office is after you. Be
		at the Wyatt Club courts at six...

	Bud looks worried, at Marvin.

	INT. WYATT CLUB SQUASH COURTS - DAY

	Games in progress on the four courts, heavy hitting sounds.
	Crossing to Gekko and Bud going at it. Bud is obviously the
	worse for wear.

				GEKKO
			(amused)
		...come on sport, you gotta try
		harder, I need some exercise for
		chrissake...

				BUD
			(out of breath)
		Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go
		on.

				GEKKO
		...finish out the game, Bud, push
		yourself...

	Meant paternally or sadistically, it's hard to tell. Gekko
	hits the ball, a big fat shot. Bud returns, Gekka moves him
	around the court, as if punishing him, the kid exhausted but
	the ball's never quite out of reach -- till Bud finally
	can't take it anymore and at the end of his breath, smashes
	into the wall and collapses. Gekko laughs. Bud lying there
	like a sad dog as Gekka hauls him up.

				GEKKO
		The public is out there throwing
		darts at a board, sport. I don't
		throw darts at a board. I only bet
		sure things. Read Sun Tzu's "The
		Art of War." 'every battle is won
		before it is ever fought.' Think
		about it.

	He exits the squash court.

	INT. WYATT CLUB STEAM ROOM - DAY

	Gekko and Bud sit alone, wreathed in steam.

				BUD
			(sweating)
		Nice club, Mr. Gekko...

				GEKKO
		Yeah... not bad for a City College
		boy. Bought my way into this club
		and now every one of these ivy
		league schmucks is sucking my
		kneecaps...I just got on the Board
		of the Zoological Society, cost me
		a million; that's the thing with
		WASPS -- they like animals but they
		can't stand people!

				BUD
			(easing into it)
		Uh, Mr. Gekko, we took a little
		loss today. We got stopped out on
		Tarafly...
			(Gekko waits)
		...about 50 thousand.

	Gekko's expression is frightening but cool.

				GEKKO
		I guess your father's not a union
		representative on that company.

				BUD
			(laughs, shocked)
		What? How do you know about my father?

				GEKKO
		The most valuable commodity I know
		of is information. Wouldn't you
		agree on that?

				BUD
			(exhaling deeply)
		Yes...

	INT. WYATT CLUB LOCKER ROOM - DAY

	Buddy is slumped on a bench after taking a shower, drinking
	a Coke. Gekko towelling himself down, getting dressed...naked
	man constantly stopping by to greet him. Hi Fred, hi Barry,
	how's the wife...still living in Larchmont? Yeah, still
	commuting... y'ever do anything with that Aetna Gas
	deal...nah...fishing for information, for a possible drink
	or meeting but Gekko stonewalls them all...

				GEKKO
		You're not as smart as I thought
		you were, Buddy boy, Listen hard --
		don't count on Graham and Dodd to
		make you a fortune, everybody in
		the market knows the theory, ever
		wonder why fund managers can't beat
		the S&P 500? 'Cause they're
		sheep -- and the sheep get
		slaughtered. I been in the business
		since '69. Most of these high paid
		MBAs from Harvard never make it.
		You need a system, discipline, good
		people, no deal junkies, no
		toreadores, the deal flow burns
		most people out by 35.
		Give me PSHs -- poor, smart and
		hungry. And no feelings. You don't
		win 'em all, you don't love 'em
		all, you keep on fighting, and if
		you need a friend, get a dog, it's
		trench warfare out there sport...
			(eyeing the surroundings)
		and in here too. I got twenty other
		brokers out there, analyzing Charts.
		I don't need another one. Talk to
		you sometime...

	He turns to go, Bud panicking. Is this the kissoff?

				BUD
			(with all his conviction)
		I'm not just another broker Mr.
		Gekko. If you give me another
		chance, I'll prove it to you. I'll
		go the extra yard for you. One more
		chance. Please...

	Gekko looks back, a beat, walks over to Bud, thrusts his
	towel hard at his stomach.

				GEKKO
		You want one more chance? Then stop
		sending me information and start
		getting me some. Get dressed, I'll
		show you my charts.

	INT. GEKKO LIMOUSINE - PARK AVENUE - DAY/TWILIGHT

	Cruising up Park Avenue. A panel slides open next to the bar
	with a portable computer on it. A television is turned on to
	the evening news, a low hum of voices. Gekko punches into
	the keyboard of the computer. A name appears an the screen...
	LAWRENCE WILDMAN with curriculum vitae following; address,
	phones, businesses...

				GEKKO
		Know the name?

				BUD
		'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the
		first raiders.

				GEKKO
			(amused, cold hatred)
		Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits
		he thinks he was born with a better
		pot to piss in... bribed an old
		secretary of mine to open bar mouth
		and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right
		out from under me. Wildman the
		white knight.

				BUD
			(excited)
		I remember that deal. You were
		involved?

	Gekko shuts off the computer and slides it back into the
	housing, his eyes taking in the low-volume news.

				GEKKO
		Revenge is a dish best served
		cold... well, it's payback time,
		sport.
			(looking out suddenly)
		... see that building? I bought
		into it ten years ago. It was my
		first real estate deal. I sold it a
		couple of years later and made an
		$800,000 dollar profit. It was
		better than sex. At that time I
		thought that was all tne money in
		the world...
			(drinks)
		Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a
		mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me
		half the picture, then he got fired...

				BUD
		I don't understand.

				GEKKO
		Wildman's in town. He just became
		an American citizen. Something
		big's about to go down. I want to
		know where he goes and who he sees.
		I want you, sport, to give me the
		missing half of the picture...

				BUD
		Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...
			(shaken)
		It's not what I do. I could lose my
		license. If the SEC found out, I
		could go to jail. It's inside
		information, isn't it?

				GEKKO
			(scratches his head wryly)
		Inside information. Oh you mean
		like when a father tells his son
		about a court ruling on an airline?
		Or someone overhears me saying I'm
		gonna buy Teldar Paper? Or the
		chairman of the board of XYZ
		suddenly knows it's time to blow
		out XYZ. You mean that?
			(a piercing look)
		I'm afraid sport, unless you got a
		father on the board of directors of
		another company, you and I are
		gonna have a hard time doing any
		business...

	Bud downs the rest of his drink, upset by the darkening mood.
	There's something very powerful and frighteninq about Gekko.

				BUD
		What about hard work?

				GEKKO
		What about it? You work hard. I'll
		bet you stayed up all night
		analyzing that dog you bought. And
		where'd it get you?... my father
		worked hard too like an elephant
		pushing electrical supplies. And he
		dropped dead at 49 with a heart
		attack and a tax bill and the bank
		pissed on his grave and took the
		house; my mom ended up working in a
		dish factory... Wake up pal, if
		you're not inside you're outside.
		And I'm not talking a $200,000 a
		year working Wall Street stiff
		flying first class and being
		"comfortable", I'm talking rich
		pal, rich enough to fly in your own
		jet, rich enough not to waste time,
		50-100 million, a player Bud -- or
		nothing. You had what it takes to
		let through my door. Next question:
		You got what it takes to stay...??

	The car stopping in traffic. Horns honking.

				GEKKO
			(pointing)
		Look out there...

	THEIR POV -- a STREET CORNER. A richly dressed EXECUTIVE
	stands at the curb next to the BUM with a shopping cart
	filled with garbage.

				GEKKO (O.S.)
		You really think the difference
		'tween this guy and that guy is
		luck? Mohammed, pull over.

	The car pulls over. Gekko checks his watch, pulls out the
	telephone.

				GEKKO
		...when it comes to money, sport,
		everybody's of the same religion.
		Or should be... Hope you don't mind
		if I let you off here, I'm late for
		a meeting. Good bye, nice knowing you.

	EXT. PARK AVENUE - TWLIGHT

	The CHAUFFEUR lets Bud out the door... Bud looks back at Gekko.

				BUD
		All right, Mr. Gekko...you got me.

	His eyes telling us he is weighed down by chains of guilt.

	Gekko smiles, gazes at the twilight skyline, a sudden look
	of contentment.

				GEKKO
		Yeah, it's a beautiful night. I
		love this hot stinkin' city.
			(pointing up Park Avenue)
		... nothing else like it in the
		world. Seven million people living
		on each other's heads, kids born,
		millionaires dying, people praying,
		junkies, whores, wills, lawyers,
		deals, parties, sex... guys like
		you sport -- dreaming about the big
		score. You know the best thing
		about New York is everything you
		can do here. And the worst thing is
		everything you can't do here...

	He shuts the door. Bud watches as the limo drives off.

	EXT. FIFTH AVENUE APARTMENT - DAY

	Bud, in a suit, waits next to a motorcycle across from one
	of the most desirable addresses in New York.

	The Doorman rushes to open the door under the canopy as a
	tall strong man in his fifties emerges with a LAWYER TYPE
	and a FEMALE EXECUTIVE. The man is SIR LAWRENCE WILDMAN and
	his manner and gait convey the impression of an authoritative
	presence with little patience as the chauffeur opens the
	door and he slides into the back seat of the limo.

	Buddy, astride Marv's Kawasaki 500, hits the streets after
	him. The music through the following Montage should suggest
	a chase brio.

	EXT. WALL STREET BUILIDING - DAY

	Bud shooting past the Trinity Church structure... Wildman
	gets out of his limo with his people, strides into the lobby.

	Bud quickly parks his bike on the sidewalk and rushes in
	after them... not a second too late.

	INT. LOBBY - WALL STREET BUILDING - DAY

	Bud just manages squeeze in the elevator with Wildman and
	crew -- and -- a couple of other early birds -- as the doors
	close.

	INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

	Bud eyeing Wildman, looks away as Wildman looks back at him,
	an edge of defiance to him, why are you staring at me? Not
	the world's most likeable personality.

	INT. KAHN, SEIDELMAN - OUTER OFFICE - DAY

	The doors open and Wildman and Co. step out into the
	reception area of Kahn, Seidelman... The doors close and
	Buddy continues upward.

	EXT. WALL STREET BUILDING - LATER MORNING

	The street now jammed with people hurrying to work. Buddy
	paces the curb, reacting when Wildman walks out, saying
	goodbye to the female executive and getting in the limo with
	his lawyer... Buddy follows.

	INT. LE CIRQUE RESTAURANT - PARK AVENUE - DAY

	Formal French haute cuisine. Power lunches in progress. As
	Wildman is seated with several well-dressed BANKERS at a
	good table, Bud tries to wrangle a table (next to Mr.
	Wildman on top of everything from a stiff looking Maitre d'
	who shakes his head, barely concealing his attitude towards
	Buddy's youth and general demeanor.

	EXT. LE CIRQUE - DAY

	Buddy waits outside, bored, as Wildman steps out, shakes
	hands with the bankers... Bud making an entry into his
	notebook like any good spy.

	EXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL QUEENS - DAY

	Music rising to triumphant proportions. AERIAL SHOT of Limo
	emerging from the tunnel and onto the Long Island Expressway.
	CAMERA MOVES IN, picking up Buddy on the Kawasaki, darting
	through lanes, staying several car lengths behind.

	EXT. LAGUARDIA AIRPORT - DAY

	The Limo winds its way along the perimeter road, past
	commercial airliners. It takes the turnoff for Butler
	Aviation. Buddy exits the ramp shortly after them.

	EXT. BUTLER AVIATION AIRFIELD - DAY

	A corporate saberliner jet, its engines running, idles at
	the end of the taxiway. The limo pulls up along the tarmac
	next to it and Wildman steps out, walking past a MECHANIC to
	the stairs of the plane. A STEWARDESS waits for him.

	EXT. RAMP - DAY

	Bud watches, wondering what to do as the plane taxies down
	the runway. He spots the flight mechanic and the answer
	comes to him. He starts running towards the mechanic.

	EXT. APRON - DAY

	Bud races up to the mechanic.

				BUD
		Oh shit, don't tell me Mr. Wildman
		was on board that plane?
			(the mechanic nods)
		My boss is gonna kill me. I was
		supposed to give him this.
			(holding his notebook)
		You know where that plane is going?

				MECHANIC
			(walking off)
		Erie, Pennsylvania...

	INT. PHONE BOOTH - AIRLINES TERMINAL - DAY

				BUD
			(into phone, proudly)
		...after spending the morning at
		Kahn, Seidelman -- on the 14th
		floor, the junk bond department --
		where Shane Mora works -- he had
		lunch at La Cirque with a group of
		well-dressed heavyset bean-
		counters...
			(Gekko voice back:
			"the adjectives are
			redundant, sport")
		...he later stopped off at Morgan.
		I'd say from all the palm-pressing
		and sweet smiling going on that
		Larry got some nice fat financing...
		G.G.

	INT. GEKKO LIMOUSINE - HEADING DOWN PARK AVENUE - DAY

	Alex and Susan are with him. Gekko playing the computer,
	eyes lighting up on the phone.

				GEKKO
		...bright but not bright enough,
		Sherlock, roll the dice and play a
		little monopoly... what box would
		Sir Lawrence land on in Erie,
		Pennsylvania?

	INT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

	Bud slapping his face, realizing.

				BUD
		Jesus Christ, he's buying Anacott
		Steel!

	INT. GEKKO LIMO - DAY

	Gordon already has the closing figures punched up on his
	quotron. Calls his shot.

				GEKKO
		When the market opens tomorrow, buy
		five thousand March fifty calls.
		You hear me? Start buying ten
		thousand share blocks and take it
		up to fifty dollars. When it
		reaches fifty, you can let out a
		little taste to your friends.
		Then call this number -- 555-7617:
		tell the man "blue horseshoe loves
		Anacott Steel..." You scored, Buddy!
		Be in touch.
			(hangs up)


	He hangs up, looks at Alex and Susan.

				GEKKO
		Start buying Anacott Steel all over
		the board.

	INT. BLUESTAR MAINTENANCE HANGAR - SAME DAY

	A large company banner hangs from the rafters: "Bluestar -
	The Vision Goes On." Buddy's father, Carl, Charley Dent and
	Dominick Amato are changing the generator on a 727. A welder
	is repairing a wing seam. Buddy shouting to his Dad over the
	noise.

				BUD
		Hey Dad!... Hi ya Charlie...
		Dominick...

	They wave back, Carl climbing down a maintenance stand...
	lights up a cigarette.

				CARL
		What brings you out here...

				BUD
		Client. Got a private jet over at
		Butler Aviation... Dad, you always
		gotta light up when you see me,
		it's the...

				CARL
			(don't bother me look)
		Don't start, alright.

				BUD
		Alright. Why so pissed?

				CARL
		Goddamn fare wars are murdering us.
		Had to lay off five guys. Nothing I
		could do. What is it... money?

	Bud takes out his wallet, smiles, peels out 10 $100 bills.

				BUD
		Yeah, it is. In fact I'm doing
		great. New client. Whole new league.
		It's starting to happen Dad. The
		Big Leagues! You know what I'm saying.

	He sticks the cash in his hand.

				CARL
			(doesn't)
		Sure...lots of guys at the track
		talk like that... but how do you
		know you'll have any dough next
		month...
			(looking at the money)
		What's this? I gave you two hundred.

				BUD
		Dividend. I figure I owe you about
		five thousand in nickels and dimes...

				CARL
			(tries to give it back)
		...don't be crazy. Put it to your
		school loans.

				BUD
		Don't worry about the loans. I'm
		doing good Dad and it's gonna stay
		that way now... least buy yourself
		a new suit.

				CARL
		What do I need a fancy suit for. I
		don't hobnob with the jet set. I
		just fix their planes.

	Buddy forces the money into his hand.

				BUD
		...then buy yourself a decent
		bowling jacket so when you take Mom
		out you don't look like the Roto
		Rooter man. Come on, for godsakes,
		that's what money's for. Enjoy
		yourself...

	Touched, his father shakes his head and smiles. He takes it.

				CARL
		Problem with money is you never
		have enough or you got too much --
		and when you got it you're never
		happy 'cause somebody's always
		trying to take it away from you.
		Money's one giant pain in the ass
		y'ask me... thanks.

				BUD
			(admiration)
		... Dad, you should've been a CEO.
		How about dinner?

				CARL
		Whatever night you like.

				BUD
			(remembering)
		Wait... next week's booked. Let me
		check with my girl and get back to
		you on Monday.

				CARL
			(laughs at his new lifestyle)
		Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll
		still be here.

				BUD
		...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking,
		you hear?

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	Bud silent, an intent look on his face, gazing up at the
	digital clock... as it flicks to 9:30... post time.

	Tickers, squawk boxes and shouting erupt.

	Bud calls in his order: "10,000 AN STL 46... and let me know
	how the options are opening."

	Music skips along in a revolving madcap fashion.

	INT. FLOOR OF AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE - DAY

	A CLERK hands the buy order to the FLOOR MANAGER. He starts
	writing a ticket as we pull back:

	INT. AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE - DAY

	Company floor traders are jammed into a narrow booth,
	frantically takinq orders over phones and telex machines.

	The FLOOR MANAGER gives the ticket to a RUNNER, a young man
	wearing worn sneakers, who dashes off. We follow him across
	the scruffy Exchange Floor, as he weaves through a crush of
	traders crammed around horseshoe-shaped kiosks, cathode-ray
	tubes slung above them, displaying the latest prices in
	bright, green letters and numbers. Intermittent shrieks and
	howls, calls to buy and sell, issue from the far reaches of
	the labyrinthian room.

	As in the final leg of a relay race, the RUNNER hands the
	ticket off to a COMPANY TRADER, who is buying and selling at
	the post where Anacott Steel is traded. The TRADER checks
	the ticket and turns to the SPECIALIST, executing the order.

	The camera moves up as the Anacott Steel (AN STL) quote
	flashes across the broad tape -- as the price ticks up from
	46 to 46 1/4.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	Bud paces nervously at his desk, looking at his quotron. AN
	STL appears on the screen, now up to 47. Bud puts in another
	order.

	INT. STOCK EXCHANGE FLOOR - DAY

	The SAME RUNNER races over, handing Bud's next TICKET to the
	COMPANY TRADER.

	Tilt up to the broad tape.

	As ANACOTT STEEL, AN STL, rises to 48 1/8.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	On Bud, eating a sandwich, eyes glued to the ticker. AN STL
	has climbed to 48 3/4. Marv stalks by, shouting on the phone.
	Bud looks away from the ticker, pretending to read a report.
	When Marv disappears, Bud hastily calls in at 49.

	INT. STOCK EXCHANGE FLOOR - DAY

	On the tired RUNNER dodging through the crowd, and over to
	the TRADER handing him a new ticket.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	Close on the OFFICE TICKER -- as Anacott Steel hits 50.

	Buddy jumps up from his chair, and animatedly crosses to
	Marv who is on the phone, cold calling.

				MARV
		Tell Mr. Ehrlich I've got important
		financial news! It concerns his
		future.

	Bud presses down on the phone button, cutting him off.

				MARV
		What the hell...

				BUD
		Anacott Steel. Buy it.

	Marv looks at Joe and sees a look on his face that he's
	never seen before.

				MARV
			(nervous)
		Anacott Steel -- right.

	Bud leaves, Marv re-dials.

				MARV
		Dr. Beltzer, you're gonna love this!

	Lou Mannheim hangs up the phone, a troubled look. Bud leans
	into his office.

				BUD
		Mr. Mannheim, got a sure thing.
			(whispering)
		Anacott Steel.

				MANNHEIM
			(scoffs)
		No such thing Bud - 'cept death and
		taxes. Not a good company anymore,
		no fundamentals. What's going on
		Bud? Do you know something?
			(Bud uncomfortable,
			Lou reads it)
		Remember there're no short cuts
		son, quick buck artists come and go
		with every bull market but the
		steady players make it through the
		bear markets.
			(Bud anxious to go)
		You're part of something here, Bud.
		The money you make for people
		creates science and research jobs.
		Don't sell that out.

				BUD
		You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you
		gotta get to the big time first,
		then you can be a pillar and do
		good things.

				MANNHEIM
		Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.

				BUD
		It's a winner Mr. Mannheim, trust
		me -- buy.
			(exits)


	Charlie Cushing's on the phone.

				CHARLIE
		Gotcha baby, its do-able... meet
		you at the Wyatt Club... 3pm Dinner
		Thursday... Indochina. Then we'll
		kamikaze down to Nell's, chase a
		little cotton underwear--I know
		this 18 year old bimbo, man... you
		can take it to the bank...
			(hangs up)


				BUD
			(intersects)
		Wanna play some tennis Saturday?

				CHARLIE
		You mean teach you how to play.
		Can't. Going fly fishing in Canada,
		big client...

				BUD
			(disappointed)
		...you take that Anacott Steel?

				CHARLIE
			(winks)
		...light snack, but good, thanks
		pal, you're sharking your way up...

	Dan Steeples's talking confidentially on the phone.

				STEEPLES
		I've just heard the most lovely two
		words... 'Anacott Steel.'

	Buddy dialing the phone number that Gekko gave him. He
	speaks into the receiver, in a hushed voice.

				BUD
		...Blue horseshoe loves Anacott
		Steel.
			(hangs up)


	INT. WALL STREET JOURNAL OFFICE - DAY

	The REPORTER on the other end of the phone hangs up. He
	rises from his desk, strides across the busy news floor,
	over to an ASSOCIATE.

				REPORTER
		Anacott Steel's in play. Check the
		arbs.

	EXT. GEKKO BEACH HOUSE - BRIDGEHAMPTON - TWILIGHT

	Wind and waves. Gekko's modern, Sante Fe structure house
	sits on a dune overlooking the grey Atlantic.

				GEKKO (V.O.)
		Sweeten the offer, throw 2 bucks
		more in a convertible preferred.
		And 5 year contracts for themselves.

	INT. GEKKO LIVING ROOM - DAY

	Immense slanted ceilings, a vast clean modern space filled
	with dozens of contemporary art objects, junk sculptures,
	floor to ceiling windows radiating light, that look out on a
	cantilevered deck and pool - and the ocean beyond.

				GEKKO (CONT'D)
			(on the phone)
		... Cromwell wants to play
		financial chicken with me, we'll
		see who swerves first. Where the
		hell's Gene?

	Gekko slumps down on a sofa, exhausted, watching one of
	several news reports he master-controls with a remote.

				SUSAN
			(on phone)
		You sent him to Vermont to get the
		deposition from the CEO Cromwell
		fired.

				GEKKO
		...done and done. Night gang, and
		Susan no legs waving in the air
		tonight. I want you dreaming about
		Teldar Paper.

	During this, RUDY, Gordon's 3 year-old son, drives in in the
	latest electronic baby toy -- a Porsche-bodied electric car.
	Gekko hangs up, checks out a Reuters quotron positioned nearby.

				GEKKO
		Rudy Kazootee, how's my cutie!

	The kid jumps out of the car and scoots into his father's lap.

				RUDY
		Daddy bad boy! Bad boy! -- play
		with Wudi... Now!

				GEKKO
		No, not now Rudy. Daddy's making
		money to buy you toys. Daddy work.

				RUDY
		Daddy work bad boy!

	Gordon absently tossles Rudy's hair, his eyes glued to the
	TV. The kid senses it, jumps back off his lap and into the car.

				BUSINESS ANALYST
		...the big story tonight is Anacott
		Steel which closed at 51 1/8.  Up 5
		1/8 from yesterday's close on heavy
		trading...

	Kate, Gordon's beautiful, raven-haired wife, homemaker and
	antiquer, enters with the bovine-eyed AU PAIR GIRL from
	France... just at Rudy drives his car into a wall where it
	stalls, engines grinding.

				KATE
		I think somebody's playing hooky
		from the bathtub. Rudy, say good
		night DAddy...

				GEKKO
			(can't hear, to Kate)
		Shut that off, willya!

	Kate, upset with the noise, tries to pull her son nicely out
	of the car.

	The Korean HOUSEBOY coming in.

				HOUSEBOY
		Calls for you, sir, a reporter from
		Time magazine on two, says it's
		important... and a Mr. Fox on three.
	 
			GEKKO
			(annoyed)
		I come to the country and it's
		worse than the city! I'm not home...
			(changes mind, pushes in)
		Yeah?

				BUD
			(off)
		Mr. Gekko, I've been trying to
		reach you. We got the options. We
		got a good execution on them!

	Meanwhile, the kid has no intention of going anywhere and
	plants his feet and emits the loudest shrieking this side of
	the fat lady in the opera.

				GEKKO
		Nicole! Take him will you...

	Handing the bawling, writhing mass of anger to Nicole as if
	it were laundry she doesn't want to touch... Nicole takes
	him screaming out of the room... Gordon trying to concentrate
	on the TV.

						INTERCUT TO:

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	Papers and charts are strewn around, trailing down to a box
	of take-out pizza and empty beer bottles. Bud has stayed late.

				BUD
			(almost apologetic,
			speeding on the high
			of the buy...)
		I got all I could get which was
		750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50
		calls. Average price of $47 a share
		And $4 per contract for the call. I
		just wish I could've got more.

				GEKKO
		Don't expect to get it all, sport,
		you'll burn out. First rule of
		business is never get emotional
		about stock, clouds the judgment.
		Where do we stand?
	 
			BUSINESS ANALYST
		In response to an inquiry from the
		New York Stock Exchange, management
		issued a terse no comment. Wildman
		would not return phone calls.
		Analysts believe the company is
		worth $75 per share in a transaction.

				KATE
		John and Carmen are here and the
		Livingstons are on their way...

				GEKKO
			(nods, listening to phone)
		I'll be right there, fix them a drink.

				BUD
			(shifting the figures)
		...we have 37.2 million invested.
		At this point, we're up 3.1 million
		and some change. If it goes to 75
		bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.

				GEKKO
			(smiles)
		You're walking between the
		raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry
		is choking on his royal chamber pot
		by now.

				BUD
		My firm needs your signature on
		these option agreements tonight,
		sir, otherwise we could take a real
		bath tomorrow.

				GEKKO
			(sighs)
		...Can't it wait? I'm good for it.
			(Bud waits, "Sir")
		...Awright. Come out, get the
		directions from Natalie and hurry up.

	EXT. GEKKO'S BEACH HOUSE - BRIDGEHAMPTON - NIGHT

	Bud's P.O.V. as he pulls up to an austere, ultra-
	sophisticated monolith of glass and wood dominating a
	stretch of dune overlooking the Atlantic's angry surf.
	Several Jags, state of the art Jeeps and a Rolls are drawn
	up outside.

	Bud, getting out of his faded Honda, goes up the stairs to
	the door. He rings several times.

	A BLACK BUTLER opens it and looks at Buddy somewhat warily.
	Laughter and voices are heard from inside.

				BUTLER
			(pretentiously: high
			English accent)
		Can I help you?

				BUD
		Bud Fox. Got some papers for Mr.
		Gekko to sign.

				BUTLER
		Wait a moment please.

	Without thinking he closes the door in Joe's face. He stands
	there, harrassed peering around through a window on the lawn.
	A small gathering of friends in progress around a glowing
	fireplace. The butler waves him in from the door.

	INT. GEKKO ALCOVE - NIGHT

	Bud enters, as Gekko approaches.  He seems annoyed to be
	disturbed at his country home.

				BUD
			(apologetic)
		Sorry, Mr. Gekko.

				GEKKO
			(takes the papers)
		Allright. Wait here...

	About to go when his wife, Kate Gekko, comes over. A pretty
	dark-haired woman.

				KATE
		Problems?

				GEKKO
		No... Bud Fox, my wife, Kate...

	They exchange pleasantries.

				KATE
		You came from the city?
			(with a look to Gordon)
		Long drive, have a drink.

	Gekko doesn't seem to like the idea, but...

				GEKKO
		Yeah, why not, Bud boy...
	 
Kate's walking back inside to her guests, as Bud sidles over
	to Gekko.

				BUD
		...if you'd rather not, Mr. Gekko,
		I can leave...

	INT. GEKKO LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	They cross to the main living room.

				GEKKO
		...It's okay Buddy, you know Alex...
		Candice Rogers.
			(Alex and his date
			shake hands, faintly aloof)
		...This is Stone Livingston... and
		his wife Muffie.
			(a young stuffy
			banker in weekend
			corduroys looks at
			Bud as if he
			obviously doesn't belong)
		...Darien Taylor, Sam Ruspoli,
		Carmen Winters, Dick Brady... All
		old friends.

	Bud looking wide-eyed at the beautiful "Calvados" BLONDE
	he's been dreaming of for weeks... she's with Mr. GQ and
	doesn't recognize Bud, nods back, they all nod back,
	naturally suspicious of the young outsider... Rudy's TOY
	ROBOT wheels  around the floor with a drink on its tray,
	talking computer talk...

				STONE LIVINGSTON
			(charmed by it)
		...good idea Gordon, good help is
		hard to find these days but can he
		whip up a dry vodka martini...

				GEKKO
		...well he doesn't talk back or
		steal the silver and Dick's gonna
		get me an exemption on him, aren't
		you...
			(Dick Brady is
			obviously an accountant)


	Bud plucks a glass of wine from the robot's tray and plunks
	himself down on a sofa, overhearing the conversation between
	Muffie Livingston and Candice Rogers.

				MUFFIE
		...there I am in St. Kitt's in my
		new Kamali leopard skin V-cut
		bikini which is going to turn back
		the clock on our marriage five
		years, you know what I mean, and I
		can't even fit into it, my skin's
		all pink and inflamed, and I look
		like a walking social disease all
		because this Ukranian bitch botched
		the wax on my bikini line.

				CANDICE
			(revolted)
		Oh my god, how ghastly, you should
		sue her...

	The Korean houseboy has come over to Gekko.

				HOUSEBOY
		Call for you sir. Sir Larry
		Wildman, he says it's important...

	Bud tightens, so does the whole room hearing the name of the
	moment. Gekko smiles at Buddy.

				GEKKO
			(to houseboy)
		Make Mr. Livingston a martini would
		you Nyung, and this gentleman...
			(to Bud)
		Stick around, this could be fun...

	He goes to the alcove to take the call.

				MUFFIE
		So, I had to sit around the beach
		wearing a moo-moo for 10 days, my
		whole vacation ruined.
			(noticing as Bud
			laughs, chokes on the
			wine, spilling some
			on the couch)
		You just spilled your wine.

	Bud noticing the stain, starts wiping it.

				CANDICE
		You're just making it worse.

	INT. GEKKO ALCOVE - NIGHT (RAIN)

				GEKKO
			(on phone)
		Larry, what a surprise...
			(beat)
		Can it wait till tomorrow. I got
		some people over.
			(dryly)
		...if you feel that way Larry, come
		over.

	INT. GEKKO LIVINGROOM - NIGHT (RAIN)

	The blonde, DARIEN TAYLOR, is examining a modern sculpture
	as Buddy comes over with two Calvados.

				BUD
		Hello again, I been holding these
		drinks for us for the last three
		weeks.

				DARIEN
			(uncomprehending)
		Excuse me.

				BUD
		Grand Marnier. A romantic and
		tragic drink.

				DARIEN
		Oh yes, I remember you.

				BUD
		Destiny took us apart, but I knew
		it would bring us back together.

				DARIEN
		Aha. Poet or philosopher?

				BUD
		Stock broker. As in: never have so
		few done so little for so much. So
		what do you see in this?

	Bud indicates the painting in front of them -- a buffalo
	skull in the desert by Georgia O'Keefe.

				DARIEN
		I'd give anything to have this in
		my house, even for a week.

				BUD
		...few thousand dollars down the
		drain if you ask me.

				DARIEN
		Oh really?
			(looks at him quizically)
		Well, I guess you can kiss that
		career as an art appraiser goodbye,
		because we paid over four hundred
		thousand for it at the contemporary
		picture sale last June.

				BUD
			(chokes)
		You could have a great beach house
		for that.

				DARIEN
		Sure you could, in Wildwood, New
		Jersey. If you sold this,
			(indicates a Rothko
			hanging near the O'Keefe)
		you could have a pretty nice
		penthouse on Fifth. But you
		wouldn't have much left over for
		decoration.

				BUD
		Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough
		businessman, but somebody's really
		taking him to the cleaners here.

				DARIEN
		Not really. I'd say that Gordon is
		one of the most astute collectors
		around. He has a great eye and he
		only buys the best. Like this rug
		for instance, a silk Tabriz, the
		finest of its kind. The day after
		he bought it in London, a dealer
		representing the Saudi Royal Family
		offered him twice what he paid. It
		absolutely makes the room. See how
		this little bit of celadon in the
		border is picked up in the cushions
		oh the sofa... although...
			(she's really warming
			up to her subject now)
		I don't know if I would have used
		that tea dipped linen for the
		upholstery - too dingy.
		And it's a sacrilege having that
		Pre-Columbian pot in the center of
		the coffee table. Some dope might
		use it as an ashtray.

				BUD
		I gather you're a decorator.

				DARIEN
		You got it, a great spender of
		other people's money.

				BUD
		Well, if you're that good, you
		could probably do wonders at my place.

				DARIEN
		Where is it?

				BUD
		Upper West Side.

				DARIEN
			(losing interest fast)
		Oh really. Home of the exposed
		brick wall and the
			(shudders)
		houseplant.

				BUD
		Oh it's just a rental. I'm moving
		to the East Side soon. I've got a
		couple of deals brewing with Gordon.
			(shifts uncomfortably
			with his pretension)
		but that's just conversation...
		what about real things? Like dinner.
		The two of us. Friday. Cafe. Santo
		Domingo.

	Bud waits, staring suddenly and deeply into her eyes.

				DARIEN
		What if I have a previous engagement?

				BUD
		Break it.

				DARIEN
		I guess this must be destiny
		alright. My first yuppie apartment
		and...
			(pats him on the
			cheek flirtatiously)
		my first yuppie.

				BUD
			(gives her a steely glare)
		You may call me a yuppie... It's
		Mister Yuppie to you.

	They both laugh.

				BUD
			(gets serious)
		So. See you Friday.

				DARIEN
		You really do believe in destiny?

				BUD
		Only if I want something bad enough.

	Her date, Mr. GQ, SAMMY RUSPOLI intersects with Kate. A
	cultivated European air.

				SAM
		...there you go again, Darien,
		talking with strange men.

				KATE
		That's our Darien: elusive,
		reclusive, exclusive.
			(to Sam)
		You know Bud right? He works for
		Gordon...
			(Sam nodding, makes
			conversation, big smile)
		Sam's in banking. You staying for
		dinner Bud?

				BUD
			(hesitant, eyes Darien)
		No, I'm afraid I've got to get some
		work...

	Kate noticing the doorbell ringing.

				KATE
		...excuse me.

	Sam muttering something in Darien's ear of an intimate
	nature. She glides away with him.

				DARIEN
			(to Bud)
		Call me next week, I'll give you an
		estimate...

	An ironic promise in her eyes... Bud ecstatic inside...
	looks over, goes to the foyer...

	INT. GEKKO ALCOVE - NIGHT (RAIN)

	SIR LARRY WILDMAN walks in, his country gentleman clothing
	somewhat softening his imposing figure but not the cultured
	rapacious eagle's face. With him a lawyer.

				KATE
			(strained)
		Larry, how have you been? Get you a
		drink?

				WILDMAN
			(slightly impatient)
		Oh fine. Travelling actually.
		Nothing thank you. Is...

				KATE
		Gordon?... He's right here.

	As Gordon intersects, casually tasting a spot of the dinner.

				GEKKO
		Larry! Excuse me "sir" Larry, great
		to see you again, you're looking
		good.
			(handshakes)


				WILDMAN
		Gordon...
			(sniffing the guests
			and furnishings in
			the room as if they
			were stale air)


				BUD
			(leaving, to Gordon)
		I guess I'll head back...
	 
			GEKKO
			(spontaneously)
		Stick around... Larry, one of my
		"gang" -- Bud Fox.

	Pleasantries. Bud nervously shakes hands, sensing Wildman
	might recognize him from being tailed in the elevator. There
	indeed is a moment but Wildman's attention blurs as...

				GEKKO
		Shall we go upstairs?

	INT. GEKKO DEN - NIGHT (RAIN)

	Gordon enters a den lined with old books hunting prints;  he
	proudly picks up something from his gun collection.

				GEKKO
		Rarest pistol in the world, Larry,
		a .45 Luger. Only six were ever
		manufactured.

				WILDMAN
		Congratulations but rarer still is
		your interest in Anacott Steel.

				GEKKO
		The same interest as yours Larry.
		Money. I thought it'd be a good
		investment for my kid...

				WILDMAN
		No. This time I'm in for the long
		term. This is not a liquidation,
		Gordon. I'm going to turn it around.
		You're getting a free ride on my
		tail, mate, and with the dollars
		you're costing me to buy back the
		stock, I could modernize the plant.
		I'm not the only one who pays here
		Gordon. We're talking about lives
		and jobs; three and four generations
		of steel workers...

	A strong hint of the cockney working class east and London
	boy whiffing through his speech and manner. The "mate" is
	tough and to the point but not insulting...

				GEKKO
			(has to smile)
		You must be wearing a mask you're
		laughing so hard behind it Larry.
		Let's cut the "sir" crap. Correct
		me if I'm wrong, but when you took
		CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000
		workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000,
		that airline...

				WILDMAN
			(cold, deliberate)
		I could break you, mate, in two
		pieces over my knees, you know it,
		I know it, I could buy you six
		times ever, I could dump the stock
		just to burn your ass but I happen
		to want the company and I want your
		block of shares. I'm announcing a
		tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and
		I'm expecting your commitment.

	Bud watching this drama unfold. Gekko is about to blow,
	controls it.

				GEKKO
		Showdowns bore me Larry, neither
		side wins. You can have the
		company, in fact it's gonna be fun
		watching you and your giant ego try
		to make a horserace out of it...
			(turns to Bud)
		What do you think is a fair price
		for our stock Bud?

	Bud in the spotlight. The eyes all shift to him -- his
	moment. After an initial panic, he's cool as a cucumber --
	and ruthless as his mentor.

				BUD
		The break up value is higher. It's
		worth 80.

				GEKKO
		But we don't want to be greedy now,
		so let's let him have it at $72.

	His eyes to Wildman who looks at him, cold, icy mean.

				WILDMAN
		You're a two bit pirate and a
		green-mailer, Gekko, nothing more...
		not only would you sell your mother
		to make a deal, you'd send her COD...

	Bud looking sharply as Gekko's eyes flare with hot white anger.

				GEKKO
		My mail's the same color as yours
		Larry. Or it was till the Queen
		started calling you "sir". Now
		excuse me before I lose my temper...

	He rises and exits.

				WILDMAN
		$71...

	Gekko stops at the door, a beat.

				GEKKO
		Considering you brought my mother
		into it, $71.50.

				WILDMAN
		Done. You'll hear from my lawyers.
		8 a.m. Good night.

	He walks out with the silent lawyer. Past Gekko who watches.
	"Ta Ta".

				GEKKO
			(to Bud)
		He's right. I had to sell. The key
		to the game is your capital
		reserves. You don't have enough,
		you can't pee in the tall weeds
		with the big dogs.

				BUD
			(mimicking Gordon now)
		"All warfare is based on
		deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your
		enemy is superior, evade him, if
		angry, irritate him, if equally
		matched, fight... if not, split and
		reevaluate.

				GEKKO
		You're learning, sport...

	INT. BUD'S APARTMENT - PRE-DAWN

	Exhausted from the drive back, Bud takes off his sweater and
	tie and collapses onto the bed, closing his eyes. The phone
	rings. With a start he wakes and answers it.

				BUD
		Yeah?...

						INTERCUT TO:

	EXT. GEKKO'S BEACH HOUSE - DAWN

	The sky is still dark, the first rays of light coming up
	over the ocean. Gekko, a lonely figure in a windbreaker,
	restlessly prowls the edge of the beach, waves crashing
	around him. He's been up all night and has an exhausted,
	driven look as he whispers over the wind into the cellular
	phone...

				GEKKO
		Money never sleeps pal. When I came
		in in '69, they traded six hours a
		day, now the clock don't stop,
		London's deregulated, the Orient is
		hungrier than us. Just let the
		money circle the world, sport,
		buying and selling, and if you're
		smart it comes back paying. I just
		made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold.
		It's been wired to you -- play with
		it. You done good, but you gotta
		keep doing good. I showed you how
		the game works, now school's out.

				BUD
			(protests)
		Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.

				GEKKO
		You don't understand. I want to be
		surprised...astonish me, sport, new
		info, don't care where or how you
		get it, just get it... My wife
		tells me you put a move on Darien.
		Here's some inside info for you.
		That Euroflash GQ guy she's going
		with's got big bucks but he's
		putting her feet to sleep. Exit
		visas are imminent. So don't lose
		your place in line.
			(gazing at the surf)
		Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this.
		The lights coming up over the water.
		I've never seen a painting that
		captures the beauty of the ocean at
		this moment.
			(suddenly fatigued)
		...an old Russian proverb - "a
		fisherman always sees another
		fisherman from afar." I like you
		sport, I ever tell you that...
		Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.

				BUD
			(off)
		...Gordon.

				GEKKO
		Yeah, I'm gonna make you rich, Bud
		Fox. I'm gonna make you rich enough
		you can afford a girl like Darien.
		Remember, power is the best
		aphrodisiac. This is your wake-up
		call. Go to work.

	He lets the phone drop to his side, staring glazed-eyed at
	the ocean.

	INT. ROGER BARNES' OFFICE - EARLY EVENING

	A SECRETARY leads Bud into the plush, private office of a
	cocky young lawyer, ROGER BARNES, about tho same age as Bud,
	his his feet up on the desk, sleepily waving to Buddy to
	park his ass... The pictures an his walls and desk indicate
	a rich family.

				ROGER
		Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has
		it really been a year. You're not
		hitting me up for NYU are you?

				BUD
		Well we're thinking of putting up a
		statue of you in the subway. I hear
		you're moving up in the world. An
		associate already. Not bad. How's
		Margie?

				ROGER
		Can't complain. Got a house in
		Oyster Bay. Market treating you
		good? Still seeing that sexy French
		gal?

				BUD
		Nah, she asked the wrong question.

				ROGER
		What was that?

				BUD
		"What are you thinking?"...that was
		it. The hours are hell, but the
		money's starting to tumble in. I
		know this guy who's got an iron-
		clad way to make money, I can't
		lose and I can't get hurt.

				ROGER
			(interested)
		So, does "this guy" have a tip for
		an honest lawyer?

				BUD
		Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's
		still not over.

				ROGER
		Okay.

				BUD
		What about you, I hear you guys are
		handling the Fairchild Foods merger
		and it may not be going through.
		Any surprises I haven't read about
		in the Wall Street Journal?

				ROGER
			(casually)
		Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to
		got me disbarred now would you?

				BUD
			(equally casual,
			looks at the walls)
		Who's listening? It's just one
		college buddy talking to another.

				ROGER
			(sarcastic)
		Yeah, right...

				BUD
		Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it
		but you don't know, you don't know.

				ROGER
		...and if I did, what's in it for moi?

	He obviously has thought about it before. Bud smiles back,
	nonchalant.

				BUD
		More money than you ever dreamed,
		Roger. And the thing is no one gets
		hurt...how bout a beer?

				ROGER
			(some doubt)
		Too much to do...but I'll walk you
		out.

	INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ROGER BARNES' OFFICE - EVENING

	They walk out past the CLEANING CREWS coming in for the
	evening, drones of the vacuum cleaners...

	Bud looks - his POV... A CLEANING WOMAN as she pulls the
	vacuum cleaner into one of the senior partners offices, the
	desk crammed with proposals, Bud is lost in thought.

				ROGER
			(teasing)
		...Get inside my uncle's door
		Buddy, all the secrets of the world
		are yours... the life blood of
		companies, but you gotta go to law
		school first...

	EXT. BARNES' OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

	Bud comes out of the building and starts walking away. As he
	passes the freight entrance, Bud abruptly notices a van
	marked MARSALA MAINTENENCE COMPANY. He looks back, thinks
	for a moment: a look in his eyes.

	EXT. LONG ISLAND CITY - LIGHT INDUSTRIAL PARK - DAY

	Bud walks past a row of small warehouses and enters one.

	INT. MARSALA MAINTENANCE OFFICE AND GARAGE SERVICE - DAY

	He steps into a shabby reception area. A chain-smoking OLD
	LADY looks up from the switch-board.

				BUD
		I need to speak to the owner about
		some business.

	INT. BACK OFFICE - DAY

	The owner, a GREEK with bushy mustache and hardened face,
	sits at his desk eating lunch, eyeing Bud suspiciously.

				BUD
			(handing him a card)
		Mr. Panos, I've charted the growth
		of new office space in the city,
		and I think you're in the right
		business at the right time.

				PANOS
		Thank you for telling me what I
		already know.

				BUD
		I'm impressed with your work and I
		could use a tax break. This is a
		growing business. Are you interested
		in some working capital and a partner?

	Panos puts down his sandwich, measuring Bud.

				PANOS
		What makes you think I need a
		partner?!

	Bud smiles, ready with his spiel.

	An elevator opens. A body steps out. A set of keys. Boom up
	past a clipboard and pen to a shirt pocket with MARSALA
	MAINTENANCE written on it, up to Bud dressed in janitorial
	clothing.

	We move with him to the CREW SUPERVISOR who introduces THREE
	CLEANING WOMEN who nervously absorb Bud, worried for their
	jobs.

	Bud strolls from office to office, looking official,
	overseeing his crew, making notations on a checklist.

	Bud slips into the Senior Partners' office, thumbs through a
	calendar on the desk. Sees the list of people, moves to the
	computer, punches the client's name in. The code number
	comes up.

	Bud nods to a SECURITY GUARD down the hall and enters the
	file room where he looks at the Cleaning Lady and points to
	his watch. As she exits, he scrambles nervously through the
	files -- finds the code number -- then anxiously flips the
	pages to the critical tender offer document -- with the
	target name -- INVESTMENT IN RORKER ELECTRONICS CORP. It's
	stamped "DRAFT" across the page. His face lights up. The
	secret to the kingdom. He puts it back, exits.

						WIPE TO:

	INT. GEKKO'S OFFICE - DAY

	Gekko on the phone, smiling.

	INT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

	Bud, obviously exhausted from his day and night roles, is
	telling him something on the phone.

	INT. SECOND LAW FIRM - NIGHT

	Bud furtively xeroxes a document on a small hand-carried
	copy machine in his pocket or photographs it if it is too
	large.

	INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

	Bud and Alex, Gekko's assistant, having lunch. Alex gives
	him the briefcase he's carrying. Pan from Alex to Bud back
	to discover Darien in the next scene.

	INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

	Bud dines with Darien, small talk, intimate looks.

	INT. THIRD LAW FIRM - NIGHT

	Bud is in an office, eyes panning the shelves.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Can I help you?

	Bud's head jerks around. A young female PARALEGAL is burning
	the midnight oil. She looks at him from behind a stack of
	briefs.

				BUD
			(backing off)
		Uh. Wrong office. Sorry...

	EXT. BRIDGEHAMPTON BEACH - DAY

	Gekko, Kate, Bud, Darien and A FIFTH PERSON roar over the
	dunes, each in their own dune buggy, laughing and hollering
	at one another...

	Buddy driving right up precariously close on Darien, who
	screams... Buddy flips over his vehicle... comes up
	laughing... we sense he is getting wilder now...

	EXT. HORSE FARM - BRIDGEHAMPTON - DAY

	Darien rides expertly. A beautiful, immaculately-groomed
	stallion is being shown to Gekko by the trainer.

	Bud is sipping wine as he looks on with Kate.

				GEKKO
			(proudly)
		Got him at an auction in Kentucky.

				BUD
		How much?

				GEKKO
			(fondling the head)
		Close to two million.
			(Bud whistles)
		But this sucker can go all the way
		to Devon and the nationals.

	Darien rides in, smiling to Bud.

				BUD
		Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew.
		What about the Triple Crown?

				DARIEN
		He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a
		jumper.

				BUD
		How would I know? I once bet a
		horse. He went out at ten to one
		and came in at quarter to five.

	He laughs, a little sloppy.

	EXT. OCEAN - DAY

	Darien swims in the ocean, long looping athletic strokes.

	EXT. POOL AND PATIO - GEKKO'S BRIDGEHAMPTON HOUSE - DAY

	They're finishing lunch by the pool framed by a lush flower
	garden where Kate and son Rudy play. HAROLD SALT, Gekko's
	chief lawyer, thick glasses, smart eyes and bags of worry
	that could only come from watching other people's money,
	looks very city-like in his clothing, examining his
	paperwork before passing it to Bud, who is the picture of
	relaxation.

				HAROLD
		...You understand Mr. Gekko is
		constantly barraged with nuisance
		litigation and IRS audits.

				BUD
			(nods)
		Of course.

				HAROLD
		...So it's in both our interests to
		put a safe distance between you and
		us...
			(passing a document
			with a 2nd pen)
		...this gives you limited power of
		attorney for Mr. Gekko's account.
		Every trade you make is at your
		discretion. Every ticket you buy
		must be marked "power of attorney."
		That means you call the shots and
		Mr. Gekko has no official knowledge
		of what stocks you're buying. Sign
		here and here...

	Buddy looks, then up to Gekko, who smiles, casual.

				GEKKO
		...just the beginning, sport, just
		the begining...

	Bud smiles, signs.

				HAROLD
			(a worrier)
		...you understand if any problems
		arise, you're out there on your own.
		The trail stops with you...

				BUD
		All's fair in love and war.

				GEKKO
		The art of which is deception.
		Spread the buy orders through
		different accounts and you won't
		get burned...

				BUD
		I think I got some friends that
		won't mind making some easy money...

	As Kate drifts over with Rudy and the French au pair GIRL,
	NICOLE.

				GEKKO
		Rudy, viens ici, dit bonjour a
		Monsieur Bud.

	Rudy either says "No!" or "Bonjour Monsieur Bud!' depending
	on the mood of the kid. Gordon sweeping him up and playing
	with him. The kid squeals with glee.

				GEKKO
			(proudly)
		Already speaks a little French, kid
		got the highest score on his IQ test.

				KATE
			(to Darien)
		...it's so tough to get into a good
		nursery school now. They even visit
		your home to make sure your
		paintings and furnishings are
		acceptable.

				BUD
		What's it cost these days?

				KATE
		$5,000 just for the tuition... plus
		the books and supplies...
			(with a look to Gordon)
		...some parents even have bodyguards.
		It's not a bad idea...
			(picking up Rudy)
		...now that's it for you with the
		grown-ups young man.

	As Rudy smashes the strawberries around his face and resists
	going. "No! No!" Kate exasperated gives the child to Nicole.

				KATE
		Nicole, take him for a nap, please.

				NICOLE
		He doesn't nap anymore, Madame.
		It's been...

				KATE
			(stung)
		Then play with him till he gets
		tired. We're going out tonight but
		we like to see him at, let's see,
		six; give him a bath and put that
		cute little black suit on him...
			(to Bud and Gordon)
		Black clothes are the newest
		things, so chic and milk stains,
		carrot juice stains just don't show
		up. Kids -- boy, can they take it
		out of you!

	Nicole's "Oui, Madame" is lost in the wrestling match she
	goes through to drag him out screaming. Kate walking off.
	Harold gives Buddy another piece of paper...

				HAROLD
		This is a contact at one of our
		banks. On settlement day you'll
		open an account there for Mr. Gekko
		under the name of Geneva, Roth
		Holding Corp. Then you'll wire
		transfer the money to this account
		in the Cayman Islands...

				GEKKO
			(rising, finished
			with lunch)
		Think about incorporating yourself
		there, Bud, Harold will take care
		of it for you.
			(with a look to Harold)
		... at a reasonable fee. You're
		gonna make a lot of money now Bud...
		stakes are gonna go up, no mistakes...

				BUD
		...piece of cake, Gordon...

	EXT. BEACHFRONT - DAY

	The camera glides off some FISHERMEN hauling their catch off
	their beached boat to Darien who comes tromping out of the
	surf, water glistening off her lean athletic body. Bud
	stands before her, cool seductive eyes, holding out a towel.
	She steps up to him and smiles inscrutably. Takes the towel
	from him, drying herself, instead.

				DARIEN
			(gazing at the beach)
		If I could have anything... this
		would almost do.

				BUD
		Yeah, almost...

	Looks at her, stifles his thought.

				DARIEN
			(teasing)
		So, how did your conference go with
		Gordon?

				BUD
		The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We
		reached an agreement and decided to
		divide up the world between us.

				DARIEN
			(laughs)
		You have modest wants. I like that
		in a man.

				BUD
		And what do you want?

				DARIEN
		...a Turner, a perfect canary
		diaiaond... a Lear jet... world
		peace... the best of everything...

				BUD
		Well, why stop at that?

				DARIEN
		I don't.

				BUD
			(has to smile)
		You're not trouble by any chance.
		Are you?

	She looks at him, tosses the towel over her shoulder and
	starts back toward the house. Buddy watches her go.

	INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY

	The annual Teldar Paper stockholders' meeting is in session:
	400 stockholders are there -- many middle aged and older,
	one bag lady. Cromwell sits on an elevated platform at the
	front of the room surrounded by an army of bulky EXECUTIVES,
	none of them weighing less than 200 pounds, ACCOUNTANTS and
	LAWYERS. Gekko in contrast seems like Robin Hood seated with
	Alex, Harold, Bud and the other stockholders. Cromwell is
	delivering his prepared attack on Gekko in a highly
	sarcastic, gruff manner.

				CROMWELL
		...Your company, ladies and
		gentlemen, is under siege from
		Gordon Gekko.
		Teldar Paper is now leveraged to
		the hilt, like some piss poor South
		American country...instead of using
		our cash to build plants, build our
		business, all this man really wants
		is to get paid to withdraw his
		tender offer and that will cost us
		approximately another $200 million
		in greenmail which will be passed
		on to the consumer...

	Gekko seething, jumps up.

				GEKKO
		Where do you get off speaking about
		me like that, making remarks to the
		press, I resent these remarks, I
		demand the right to speak.

				CROMWELL
		Sit down, sir, you're out of order,
		haven't you done enough damage to
		Teldar as it is?...have you no
		sense of decency?
			(to shareholders)
		How can your management...

	Gekko is urged to sit down by his people but we hear various
	catcalls, "Let the man speak!" "Sit down, Gekko!"

				CROMWELL (CONT'D)
		...concentrate on long term growth
		when we're busy fighting the get-
		rich-quick, short term profit, slot
		machine mentality of Wall Street
		when we should be fighting Japan!
		The original fundamental reason for
		Wall Street was to capitalize
		American business, underwrite new
		business, build companies, build
		America. The "deal" has now
		succeeded goods and services as
		America's gross national product
		and in the process, we are
		undermining our foundation. This
		cancer is called "greed". Greed and
		speculation have replaced long-term
		investment. Corporations are being
		taken apart like erector sets,
		without any consideration of the
		public good. I strongly recommend
		you to see through Mr. Gekko's
		shameless intention here to
		strip this company and severely
		penalize the stockholders. I
		strongly recommend you to reject
		his tender by voting for
		management's restructuring of the
		stock.

						CUT TO:

	Gekko is now at floor level with a microphone. He's calmer,
	makes his pitch to the stockholders, looking up at the
	management.

				GEKKO
		...I appreciate the chance you're
		giving me, Mr. Cromwell, as the
		single largest stockholder in
		Teldar, to speak.
			(gets some laughter
			and applause, loosens)
		On the way here today I saw a
		bumper sticker. It said, "Life is a
		bitch... then you die".
			(gets another laugh)
		...well ladies and gentlemen, we're
		not here to indulge in fantasies,
		but in political and economic
		reality. America has become a
		second rate power. Our trade
		deficit and fiscal deficit are at
		nightmare proportions. In the days
		of the 'free market' when our
		country was a top industrial power,
		there was accountability to the
		shareholders. The Carnegies, the
		Mellons, the man who built this
		industrial empire, made sure of it
		because it was their money at stake.
		Today management has no stake in
		the company. Altogether these guys
		sitting up there own a total of
		less than 3% and where does Mr.
		Cromwell put his million dollar
		salary? Certainly not in Teldar
		stock, he owns less than 1%.
		You own Teldar Paper, the
		stockholders, and you are being
		royally screwed over by these
		bureaucrats with their steak
		lunches, golf and hunting trips,
		corporate jets, and golden
		parachutes! Teldar Paper has 33
		different vice presidents each
		earning over $200,000 a year. I
		spent two months analyzing what
		these guys did and I still can't
		figure it out.
			(a big laugh)


	Cromwell is pissed.

				CROMWELL
		This is an outrage Gekko! You're
		full of shit!

				GEKKO
		One thing I do know is this paper
		company lost $110 million last
		year, and I'd bet half of that is
		in the paperwork going back and
		forth between all the vice
		presidents...
			(increased laughter,
			he's getting them)
		The new law of evolution in
		corporate America seems to be
		'survival of the unfittest'. Well
		in my book, you either do it right
		or you get eliminated. Teldar Paper
		is doomed to fail. Its
		diversification into casualty
		insurance has not worked. Its crown
		jewels are its trees, the rest is
		dross. Through wars, depressions,
		inflations and deterioration of
		paper money, trees have always kept
		their value, but Teldar is chopping
		them all down. Forests are
		perishable, forest rights are as
		important as human rights to this
		planet, and all the illusory
		Maginot lines, scorched earth
		tactics, proxy fights, poison
		pills, etc. that Mr.
		Cromwell is going to come up with
		to prevent people like me from
		buying Teldar Paper are doomed to
		fail because the bottom line,
		ladies and gentlemen, as you very
		well know, is the only way to stay
		strong is to create value, that's
		why you buy stock, to have it go up.
		If there's any other reason, I've
		never hear it.
			(laughter)
		That's all I'm saying...it's you
		people who own this company, not
		them, they work for you and they've
		done a lousy job of it. Get rid of
		them fast, before you all get sick
		and die. I may be an opportunist,
		but if these clowns did a better
		job, I'd be out of work. In the
		last seven deals I've been in,
		there were 2.3 million stockholders
		that actually made a pretax profit
		of $12 billion. When I bought the
		Ixtlan Corporation it was in the
		exact same position Teldar is
		today -- I turned three of its
		companies private and I sold four
		others -- and each of these
		companies, liberated from the
		suffering conglomerate has
		prospered. I am not a destroyer of
		companies, I am a liberator of them.
		The point is, ladies and gentlemen,
		greed is good. Greed works, greed
		is right. Greed clarifies, cuts
		through, and captures the essence
		of the evolutionary spirit. Greed
		in all its forms, greed for life,
		money, love, knowledge, has marked
		the upward surge of mankind -- and
		greed, mark my words -- will save
		not only Teldar Paper but that
		other malfunctioning corporation
		called the USA...Thank you.

	Much applause as he sits. Now a standing ovation; shouts of
	approval. Cromwell knows he has lost the day, tries to
	continue the meeting by calling for "order".

	Bud watches, impressed.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	BROKERS mill at their desks quietly. Bud enters, notices
	immediately the uneasy silence. His eyes go to Lynch's
	office... across the windows, he's talking to a very somber
	Dan Steeples.

				BUD
		What's going on?

				MARV
			(looking in the same direction)
		Lynch is giving him the boot...
		He's not pulling his quota.

	Bud's soft "no" matched by that second, tighter look. His
	POV -- closer on the glass... Dan Steeples pleading for his
	job... we know the things he's saying, we've heard them
	before... just one more chance, Mr. Lynch... Lynch shaking
	his head...

				MARV
			(reminding him)
		...we're all just one trade away
		from humility, Buddy...

	Dan Steeples steps out of the office, obviously close to
	tears but trying to maintain face... Buddy's eyes dart away,
	not wanting to deal with it. Dan Steeples walks by his as
	Lynch, on the loudspeaker, starts his morning announcements.

				LYNCH
		New research report on GM and a
		conference call on defense stocks
		at my office at 11. No RSVP
		required, just be there. And on an
		inspiring note I'm pleased to
		announce the new office record for
		a single month's gross commission
		goes to Bud Fox. Who more than
		doubled the old mark. Way to go Bud.
		Super job! Come on up here.

	As Dan Rickey passes him during this, Bud catches a glimpse
	of the older man's eyes. Dan tries to look brave. Heads
	turning to Bud with awe and envy...

				MARV
		Congrats buddy buddy, you just made
		my life twice as hard around here...

	Bud moving toward Lynch, past Lou Mannheim.

				MANNHEIM
		You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it
		while it lasts -- 'cause it never
		does.

				BUD
			(cocky)
		...just kickin' ass and taking
		names, Mr. Mannheim.

	Bud passes Charlie Cushing, yawning on the phone as usual.

				CHARLIE
		So whaddaya say pal, wanna play
		some doubles at Piping? Meet the
		membership? I got a little blonde
		named Mandy, about nineteen, avec
		cafe au lait boobs... she's mine
		but she's got a cousin who has
		great muffins.

				BUD
		...sounds dubious Chuck, but Piping
		Rock any day.

	Chuck laughs, Bud's "in" now. Lynch indicates for Bud to
	follow him into an outer glass-enclosed office.

				LYNCH
		Come in, Bud...

	INT. BUD'S NEW OFFICE - DAY

	Neatly furnished, with a window overlooking Wall Street, and
	attractive CHINESE SECRETARY filing papers into a cabinet.

				LYNCH
			(points)
		Congratulations. This is yours
		now... your own file cabinets... a
		window ... your private secretary,
		Janet,
			(under his breath)
		significantly more attractive.

				JANET
		Nice to meet you, Mr. Fox.

	She smiles at Bud, who heaves a sigh of relief, noticing his
	name plate on the desk.

				BUD
			(thrilled)
		Thank you, Janet...thank you, Mr.
		Lynch.

				LYNCH
		No, thank you. I knew the minute I
		laid eyes on you, you had what it
		takes Bud. Just keep it going.

	He winks and leaves. Charlie Cushing comes in, Marv sticks
	his head in the doorway, a grudging smile.

				MARV
		So, its Mister Fox now.

	INT. CONDOMINIUM APARTMENT - UPPER EAST SIDE - DAY

	A splendid four-room thirtieth floor aerie overlooking
	Central Park. SYLVIE DRIMMER, anchored down with jewelry and
	a large fur purse, shows Bud around.

				SYLVIE
		...everybody tells ya they hate the
		Upper East Side and they wanna live
		on the West Side but honey when it
		comes to resale time, believe me
		the East Side's the one that always
		moves. What do you get on the West
		Side?
			(contemptuously)
		Madonna and Sean?... between Sly
		and Billy and Christie, I've shown
		every apartment on the Upper East
		Side. Everybody lives here... Mick,
		Gloria and Barbara Wa-Wa. Even
		Klaus von Bulow buys his fresh
		fruit from the Korean on Madison.
		It's so expensive and it's just
		like the ones on Eighth Avenue but
		it's an attitude is all, you pay
		for attitude
			(pointing to a walk-
			in closet)
		...two walk-in closets...upstairs
		on the roof you lot a health
		club...massage, sauna, jacuzzi,
		sunlights, best schools in the
		city, cute boy like you gotta think
		of a ladyfriend when you're
		finished wolfing around --
			('course I'm taken)
		...oak strip floor...my husband can
		get you a 10% mortgage...I'd do it
		myself if we weren't into four
		other deals already...so?...
			(beat)
		I got a four o'clock and a
		five...one of them's an all-cash
		type, Monique something or
		other...I guarantee you this place
		is history tomorrow...

	Bud looks around. The city at his feet. Lost in thought.
	Sylvie has to call him out of it: "honey? -- The meter's
	running. Anybody home?"

				BUD
		All right. Offer 950...

	Sylvie tries to play it cool, her expression conveying a
	somewhat stunned look at the speed and certainty of the
	response.

				SYLVIE
		...I think you gotta deal, honey...
		you sure you don't wanna see
		somethin' I got on Sutton Place.
		It's a million and a half but...

				BUD
		Nah...this is it..home...

	Looking it over, proud.

	INTERIOR DECORATING MONTAGE

	The music is geared to speed, money, triumph and just plain
	material fun.

	INT. BUD'S CONDO - DAY/NIGHT

	In its first stage, Darien supervising. It's expanse of
	white walls devoid of mouldings, a blank plaster canvas. The
	city views are great, the apartment identical to hundreds of
	other cookie cutter condos. Several young artists are
	working on a neo-classical mural on the long side of the
	living room. They are colorfully dressed, listening to a
	TALKING HEADS tape while they work. A carpenter who looks
	like a member of Duran Duran is installing a pair of old
	columns from Urban Archaeology on either side of the
	entrance to the living room while another fits a brass sink
	into an antique sideboard which has been turned into a bar.

	INT. BUD'S CONDO - DAY/NIGHT

	INTERIOR DECORATING MONTAGE - SECOND STAGE

	Living room furniture arrives. A fantail shrimp chaise from
	Art Furniture's "Sushi Collection" arrives, along with an
	enormous sofa encased in an ecru linen slipcover made
	deliberately baggy and tied on with rows of self bows on
	each end, several faux Etruscan pots wired up as lamps, a
	poured concrete coffee table that looks like it came from
	Pompeii, and a hand-painted floor cloth instead of a rug for
	the bleached floor with the stencilled border... Darien
	sitting in a fantastical adirondack chair made from gnarled
	branches, amused by Bud's reactions to the furniture.

	THIRD STAGE. The kitchen has the latest compact computer
	dishwasher and compact microwave, garbage compactor, and
	sinks with infrared controls... A brief food montage gives
	us a sense of the modernist approach to food and its
	preparation:

	1) Darien hones the knives on the electric knife sharpener as

	2) Bud uses a stainless steel Cape Cod oyster opener to work
	on two dozen oysters...

	3) at the same time working on the automatic vinaigrette
	mixer, the phone ringing to the tune of Mozart's "Jupiter"...

				BUD
			(picking it up)
		Yes...no...at 37 1/2. Convert the
		bonds right...and check the price
		in Tokyo at 8:00 LA time. Thanks...

	4) As he starts his pasta sauce flame an his O'Reilly fat-
	free grill with a flexible neck fire starter...

	5) A freshly heated roll pops out of a hanging space-saving
	toaster, as Darien works the electric pasta maker while
	melting the frozen ice cream cartons in the microwave.

	6) Bud manages to sneak a kiss an her lips humming the bars
	from Verdi's "Rigoletto" as he works the piece de la
	resistance--the automatic sushi maker...

	7) Dinner is finally served on a demolished dinner table.
	Red wine, pasta, sushi...it looks perfect, lit by
	candlelight, the view of the city below.

				DARIEN
		...isn't it perfect!

				BUD
		...too perfect...let's not even eat.
		Let's just watch it and think about
		it.
			(pause)

	FOURTH STAGE - INT. BUD'S CONDO - DAY

	Bud goes over a stack of bills with something approaching
	concern as the gothic oak refectory table which seats 20 is
	carried in, followed by a Jean Michel Basquiat featuring a
	skull on a rough board. Darien instructs the movers to place
	an important pair of satinwood Art Deco armchairs upholstered
	in buttery suede (last Saturday's auction purchase for
	$20,000) at either end of the titanic sofa. No vestige is
	left of the cookie cutter space we first saw. Walls have
	been removed, mouldings and architectural found objects
	added, imitation rare woods, marbles and frescos have been
	created from nothing by the magic hands of the tromp l'oeil
	crew. The point is, decorating can transform.

	INT. CONDO - NIGHT

	The look of the place is evocative of ancient times, yet
	sumptuous. Darien and Bud sink into the bales of down in the
	sofa and are dwarfed. She rests her head on a hand stencilled
	velvet Venetian throw pillow, looking like a Pre-Raphaelite
	madonna. A terracotta pot with a spray of white phaleonopsis
	graces the coffee table. As the sun sets over the canyons of
	highrises, Bud walks around his new home totally in awe.
	This apartment, perfect in its restrained taste with all the
	"correct" flowers and objects, has nothing to do with him.
	Perhaps he can understand the state-of-the-art kitchen, the
	computerized telephone, stereo and light system, but he
	needs a set of instructions just to be able to switch on
	David Letterman.

	This apartment is Darien's fantasy, and Bud is merely the
	incidental client who paid for it. Most importantly to her,
	it is ready to be photographed by House and Garden.

				BUD
			(dubiously looking at
			a rough plaster wall
			of fading fresco)
		You know, the elevator man couldn't
		believe I paid $300,000 to have my
		walls looking like this, he's got
		them for free in Brooklyn.

				DARIEN
		I'll bet he's got an opinion on the
		stock market too. This apartment is
		already ahead of its time. I call
		it the "demolished" look. They've
		already heard about it at House and
		Garden and they're coming next week
		to photograph it before it gets...
		lived in. Is that alright? I'd love
		to have it in my portfolio.

				BUD
		Sure... But your fee... considering
		you're way over budget, should be
		negotiable.

	As he nuzzles her neck, she feels threatened, stops.

				DARIEN
		Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm
		not going to take a cut. I worked
		hard and you can't decorate a room
		in New York for less than $100,000.
		Curtains alone...

				BUD
		I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're
		still young, Darien. So what's
		money anyway when everybody's
		making it, it's all relative. After
		all, this is not the house in
		Connecticut, this is just a crash
		pad good for a couple of
		years...before we slip our two
		lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie
		into the Lycee Francaise.

				DARIEN
		You got it all charted out don't
		you, like a stock projection.
	 
			BUD
		That's right -- one with high
		yield, rich assets and no downside...

	As the kiss grows, his hands move into her nether regions.
	She looks at him, sober.

				DARIEN
		Do you think you're ready?

				BUD
		It's not me I'm worried about...You
		know Darien, the only reason we
		haven't slept together is because
		we both know we will -- and not
		knowing when was the only surprise
		left. You owe me, I want you, what
		else is there...but you, me, the
		world.
			(he folds back her
			palms in his)
		...right here...make love to
		me...now...
			(more kissing)
		Stop me if I'm going too far.

				DARIEN
		I'll let you know.

	INT. BUD'S CONDO - BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Bud making love to Darien. Camara closing on them.

	Her face -- from his point of view. Her smile.

	His face -- looking down. Covered with sweat and passion.

				BUD
		Is this real? Is this really real?

	EXT. BUD'S CONDO - TERRACE - NIGHT

	Bud walks out alone in his blue bathrobe on his parapet
	overlooking Central Park. The wind stirs his hair. The East
	and West sides of the park wrap the city in a diamond
	necklace of brilliant light.

	Bud stares down at the world. He has it all now. The money.
	The girl. The magic palace apartment. What more is there?
	Something...because Bud suddenly throws a wrenching
	dislocated look into himself that makes us wonder as he
	brushes his hand across his face and mutters to himself.

				BUD
		Who am I?

	There is no ready answer. As he finally turns and goes back
	inside and closes the door.

	INT. BUD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Darien lies curled in the bed, eyes open, looking at him.

				DARIEN
		Come to bed, Bud...

	EXT. PHONE BOOTH - SOUTH STREET SEAPORT - TWILIGHT

	Cocktail hour in the background, yuppies trying to score for
	the weekend. Bud on the phone, strained look transforming to
	a bright, upbeat personality as the phone is answered.

				BUD
		Dixon! It's your lucky day! That's
		right. I want to give you some
		stock and you don't have to put up
		a penny...

						INTERCUT:

	EXT. CABIN - ASPEN COLORADO - DAY

	A small cabin in the mountains.

	INT. CABIN - ASPEN COLORADO - DAY

	Whole earth furnishings. DIXON, a long-haired ski bum
	dropout listens skeptically.

				DIXON
		Sure, and I'm never gonna die
		either, is this one of your chain
		letter schemes or do I gotta buy a
		door to door cosmetic franchise in
		Northern Arkansas?

	EXT. PHONE BOOTH - SOUTH STREET SEAPORT - TWILIGHT

				BUD
		No, no Dixon, my client wants to
		buy a large, large block of stock
		and needs to spread it around. I'll
		park some money in your account and
		if it hits, you get a big cut. I'm
		telling you, this is the easiest
		money you ever made...

	INT. ROGER BARNES' OFFICE - DAY

	Roger listens on the phone.

				BUD
			(off)
		...and you don't have to put up a
		dime, Roger.

				ROGER
			(tentatively)
		All right, Bud... let's do it.

	A look on his face. As if he knows he's making a fatal mistake.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

				BUD
			(on the phone)
		...it's easy Jack! On settlement
		day, you endorse a check to Blue
		Horseshoe Trading Company. Then I
		send you your cut.

	Marv waves across the glass partition and knocks. But Bud
	waves him off, closing the blinds.

				BUD (CONT'D)
		...that's the bottom line. And
		nobody gets hurt.

	Marv now walks it, exasperated.

				MARV
		...things are so bad, even the
		liars are complaining. And you're
		making money. So what gives? What's
		the bottom line?

	As he tries to peak at Bud's quotron screen, but Bud flicks
	it off, pissed.

				BUD
		Hey, I'm tired of playing nurse to
		you all the time, alright. Do your
		own home work!

	Marvin abruptly walks out, "asshole!". Bud books the order
	for Morning Star Corp -- MSC -- 50,000 June options.

	INT. AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE - LATER THAT DAY

	The COMPANY FLOOR MANAGER gets Bud's order, hands a ticket
	to a RUNNER who dashes off across the exchange floor, and
	over to a TRADER who starts to execute the order.

	CLOSE on the broad tape. As Bud's large buy order flickers
	across it -- MSC -- 50,000 June options.

	INT. AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE - S.E.C. OPTIONS WATCH OFFICE -
	DAY

	A CLERK sits before a computer routinely tracking all of the
	exchange floor trading. He runs a check on a transaction.

	Computer Screen -- The same numbers and letters are seen
	that just flickered across the broad tape... Bud's buy.

	The clerk swivels his chair to a second computer and punches
	up data. A MAN appears behind him, leaning over his
	shoulder, and wears an ID BADGE. The clerk vacates his seat
	to the man with the badge, who now takes over.

	INT. BUD'S CONDO - NIGHT

	Bud is in silk boxers on the phone, number crunching on the
	computer, foot pounding to a music beat on the stereo, while
	his telex spews out overnight currency data.

	Darien in the background lies in bed in panties reading Vogue.

				BUD
			(into the phone)
		Buy me 20 June Euro Dollar CDs.
		Twenty March gold and sell 10
		September Deutsch marks. That's
		right...

	He hangs up, back to the computer a growing look of
	excitement and revelation in his eyes.

	On the computer screen we see a break up Of Bluestar
	Airlines -- its assets and liabilities.

	Bud hits the command key, printing it out. He's exuberant.

				BUD
		Bud, I hate to tell you this but
		you're a genius!
			(to Darien)
		Darien...lightning has struck! The
		lightbulb has been invented.
		Edison, Da Vinci, Einstein are
		watching...

				DARIEN
			(grumpy)
		...are you going to trade all night
		again? You got to go to work in a
		couple of hours.

				BUD
		You think I'm gonna broker the rest
		of my life... I'm going to be a
		giant, Darien, an entrepreneur in
		the Italian 15th century sense of
		the word -- a mover, shaker.

	Bud dances over to the bed turning the stereo down on his way.

				BUD
		I love you, baby. Did I tell you
		that sometime in the last 24 hours?

				DARIEN
		Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the
		sixty hour work week? You're
		turning into a yuppie Frankenstein,
		you love money so much.

	Bud grabs a bottle of Ferrier off the night table and drinks.

				BUD
		Sure, why not, money's the sex of
		the 80's. I never had it like you
		when I was growing up, baby, it
		wasn't the upper east side.

				DARIEN
		You're so naive Bud, you don't even
		know. Your dad took care of you. I
		might've been rich when I was a
		kid...but my father lost all his
		money...in the seventies, in the
		stock market, at the track. He was
		a lousy gambler...

				BUD
			(teasing)
		...that changes all my plans, I
		thought you were loaded...

				DARIEN
			(laughs woefully)
		So did I, till I hit 19 and found I
		had all the royal habits and no
		throne. Mom got by but I had to go
		to work just like you.
		Only the skills I had were shopping
		and making friends. So...that's why
		I do what I do, what makes you
		tick, Buddy?

				BUD
		Fear. The fear of being poor I
		guess, just like you, Darien... But
		that's all gonna change sweetheart.
		I'm catching the express...
			(making love to her)
		... and you're going along for the
		ride.

	INT. GEKKO'S PRIVATE PLANE (GULFSTREAM - 4) - DAY

	A salon interior. Gekko on a couch reading, with eyeglasses,
	a stack of financial reports. Alex is on the phone, Susan,
	and others accompanying the caravan on a business trip. Bud
	is excited.

				BUD
		...Bluestar's an unpolished gem,
		Gordon, right out of the garbage. A
		half assed management being
		decimated by a price war they can't
		win. But the gates at LaGuardia
		alone can bail us out, it's worth
		25 bucks a share if it's worth a
		dime! They're ripe to fall.

	Gekko, the poker player, hasn't seen enough cards.

				GEKKO
		Mixed emotions, Buddy: like Larry
		Wildman going off a cliff in my new
		Maserati. Men as smart as myself
		have got their asses handed to them
		on a sling with the airlines, fuel
		could go up, unions are killers...

				BUD
		Yeah aren't you forgetting
		something Gordon: rule one, capital
		reserves. This company has $75
		million cash in an overfunded
		pension. That buys us a lot of
		credibility...
			(Gordon looks up, interested)
		...and the beauty is you already
		own close to two percent of this
		sucker...

				ALEX
			(interrupting, on the phone)
		Gordon, the insurance people are
		balking on the logging trucks...

				GEKKO
		Tell those spineless toads we'll
		self-insure if they don't write
		it... You fire 33 vice presidents
		and nothing changes...
			(back to Bud)
		You eating twinkies today, Bud, or
		are you schtupping some stewardess...

				BUD
			(deadly serious)
		Gordon what I want--and I never
		asked you for anything--is to be
		your co-pilot on this. I want to
		take this airline, turn it around,
		and make it work. It's gonna make
		us a fortune!

				GEKKO
			(to Susan)
		I'm talking to a stockbroker who
		wants to run an airline. It's gonna
		take me two years and 2000
		headaches to turn Teldar Paper
		around, what do I need this dink
		airline for? I'm up to my ass in
		more nuts than a fruitcake.

				BUD
		Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I
		know my way around, I have friends
		there...inside.

				GEKKO
			(getting the drift)
		What does that mean?

				BUD
			(playing out his ace)
		The three unions. It's 43% of
		Bluestar's operating budget, the
		hourly cost of a flight crew is
		$850 an hour, that's the real
		hidden value G.G., if you can
		negotiate that out, get a crew down
		to $350-400 an hour a run, this
		airline is gonna be the hottest
		thing since Texas Air...

				GEKKO
		What makes you think you can?

				BUD
		I can talk to these people Gordon,
		they trust me...and my father can
		be a big help in getting cuts.

				GEKKO
			(pause)
		Alright... Susan, get Buckingham on
		the box. I want him to look at it.
		And tell Jock Taylor at Thwick,
		Jensen...
			(smiles wickedly,
			back to Bud)
		So sport, the falcon has heard the
		falconer...tell me more...

	INT. BUD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Bud, in high gear, all smiles, expensive Armani suit, opens
	the door. His father stands before him, looking like a man
	on his way to the dentist.

				BUD
		Dad, well come on in. Everybody's
		here. We couldn't start the show
		without you.

	Wide-eyed, Carl follows Bud through the foyer, taking in the
	furnishings, paintings, antiques.

				CARL
			(under his breath)
		Well I'll be a lousy Republican.

				DARIEN
			(overhears him)
		I decorate for Democrats too, lots
		of them.
			(she extends her hand
			and gives him a warm smile)
		I'm Darien Taylor.

				CARL
			(sardonically)
		I know. You're one of the art works
		that go with the apartment.
			(softens a little)
		Pretty creative. Doesn't look
		anything like the place my son
		bought a few months age.

				DARIEN
		Listen, I hope you'll come here
		often, and under less formal
		circumstances.

	Halfway won over Carl enters the living room where Darien
	has set up a table with miniature gourmet pizza, etc. The
	atmosphere is strained, the camps separated. Gekko stands by
	the bar, conferring with his lawyer, Harold Salt. Darien
	walks over to the couch with drinks for the Ixtax Union
	Reps: DUNCAN WILMORE, ALPA Leader, a rugged silver-haired
	uniformed pilot; TONI CARPENTER, AFA Rep, hard looking,
	40ish flight attendant.

				BUD
		Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore,
		pilot's union, and Toni Carpenter,
		flight attendants...

				CARL
		I met them before you were born.

	They exchange nods.

				BUD
		And I'd like to introduce you to Mr.
		Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt.

				GEKKO
		A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox.

	Carl stares at Gekko, sizing him up.

				GEKKO
		I'd be proud to have a son like Bud.
		He's got a great future ahead of him.

	Carl looks to his fellow union representatives, then to Gekko.

				CARL
			(gesturing at Salt)
		I thought this was an informal
		meeting. What's he doing here?

				GEKKO
			(dismissing him)
		Harold, you don't mind strolling
		around the block a couple hundred
		times, do you?

				HAROLD
			(looks at his watch)
		Of course...

	Salt gathers his jacket to leave, as Gekko and Carl eye one
	another, tentatively.

				DARIEN
		...please help yourselves to some
		food...

						CUT TO:

	The food is half consumed. Gekko addresses the union leaders.

				GEKKO
		Look, I have no illusions about
		winning a popularity contest with
		any of you. I was roasted the other
		night, and a friend of mine asked--
		why are we honoring this man--have
		we run out of human beings?

	His joke breaks the ice; they laugh, except for Carl.

				GEKKO (CONT'D)
		It's not always the most popular
		guy who gets the job done. You got
		losses of 20 to 30 million dollars,
		dividends cut to zero, you're
		getting squeezed to death by the
		majors. Present management may not
		be the worst scum of the earth, but
		they're the ones who've put you on
		a kamikaze course, and pretty soon
		everybody's going to be scrambling
		for the parachutes. Only there
		aren't enough to go around.
		Management has them. You don't. If
		they throw Bluestar into Chapter
		11--which I think they will--then
		they can use bankruptcy laws to
		break your unions and your
		contracts and throw you guys off
		the property.

	We hear a loud crunching sound as Bud's father bites into a
	roll, glaring at Gekko.

				WILMORE
			(pilot)
		With all due respect, Mr. Gekko,
		what's to prevent you from doing
		the same thing?

				GEKKO
		Cause I have a way around all this,
		a way we can all make money and
		make this airline profitable again.
		What do you say we cut to the chase.
		I'm asking for a modest twenty
		percent across-the-board wage cut.

	Carl drops his fork on the plate. Gekko goes on.

				GEKKO
		And seven more hours a month.

	Toni Carpenter and Duncan Wilmore exchange questionable looks.

				CARPENTER
		What kind of time frame are we
		talking about here?

				GEKKO
		Give me a year. If we're still
		losing money, the reductions stand.
		If however, we move into the black,
		I return part of the givebacks,
		salaries go back to present levels,
		and...
			(a beat)
		we institute an employee profit
		sharing program with stock. You'll
		own part of the airline.

	Carpenter and Wilmore react with surprise, it's obvious they
	weren't expecting the profit sharing part. Bud smiles at
	Darien and looks to his father, who examines a sushi roll
	before putting it back.

				WILMORE
		Are you prepared to put that in
		writing?

				GEKKO
		I'll have a letter of agreement
		drawn up within two days.

				CARPENTER
		What's your marketing strategy? How
		do you plan to return us to
		profitability?

				GEKKO
		Why don't I give Bud an opportunity
		to answer that.

	Darien and Carl turn to Bud, who puts down his wine glass.
	 
			BUD
		Thank you Mr. Gekko. First of all I
		want you to know my door will
		always be open to you cause I know
		from my Dad it's you guys that keep
		Bluestar flying. One -- Modernize.
		Our computer software is weak, we
		update it, we squeeze every dollar
		out of each seat and mile flown.
		You don't sell a seat to a guy for
		$89 when he's willing to pay $389.
		Effective inventory management
		through computerization will
		increase our load factor by 5 to
		20%, that translates to
		approximately 50 to 200 million
		dollars in revenues; the point is,
		we can beat the majors at a price
		war. Two -- Advertising -- more,
		more, and aggressive, attack the
		majors. Three -- expand our hubs to
		Atlanta, North Carolina and Dallas,
		reorganize all our feeder schedules,
		think Big -- guys, we're going
		after the majors!

	The men are visibly shaken by Bud's determination.

				GEKKO
			(looking for reactions)
		Cards are on the table. What do you
		think?

				WILMORE
			(restrained, hopeful)
		If you mean what you say, I think
		we're in the ball park. I'll take
		it to my people.

				CARPENTER
			(approvingly)
		You've sketched some broad strokes.
		I'd like to see the fine print. But
		so far so good.

	Gekko looks to Carl Fox who, putting down knife and fork,
	breaks his silence.

				CARL
		I guess if a man lives long enough,
		he gets to see everything. And I
		mean everything. What else do you
		have in your bag of tricks, Mr. Gekko?

	Bud tenses, looking at his father. Gekko ignores the
	innuendo and replies softly.

				GEKKO
		Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving
		much more. If you have any
		suggestions I'll be glad to listen.

				CARL
		There came into Egypt a Pharoah who
		did not know.

				GEKKO
			(smiling)
		I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?

				CARL
			(smiling)
		No, it's a prophecy. The rich have
		been doing it to the poor since the
		beginning of time. The only
		difference between the Pyramids and
		the Empire State Building is that
		the Egyptians didn't have unions.
			(looking at Wilmore
			and Carpenter)
		I know what this guy is about--
		greed--he's in and out for the buck
		and he don't take prisoners. He
		don't give a damn about Northstar
		or us ...

				BUD
		Now, wait a minute, Dad...

				GEKKO
			(shrugs, keeping his composure)
		Sure. What's worth doing is worth
		doing for money. It's a bad bargain
		where nobody gains. And if this
		deal goes through, we all gain.

	Carl throws down his napkin, rises from the chair, looks at
	the others.

				CARL
			(looks at Bud)
		'Course my son did work three
		summers as a baggage handler and
		freight loader. With those
		qualifications, why should I doubt
		his ability to run an airline?

	There is frozen silence at the table.

				GEKKO
		Fine, if you don't want us, stay
		with the scum in present
		management--dedicated to running
		you and Bluestar into the ground.

				CARL
		...that "scum" built this company
		up from one plane in thirty years,
		they made something out of nothing,
		and if that's a scum I'll take one
		over a rat any day...

	Carl turns and leaves. Bud glances at Gekko, reading his
	piercing look. He hurries after his father.

	INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Bud catches up to Carl, waiting for the elevator, hammering
	him.

				BUD
			(seething)
		Congratulations. You did a great
		job of embarrassing me in there--
		not to mention yourself! Save the
		"workers of the world unite" speech
		for next time Dad, I heard it too
		much growing up. You're gonna get
		axed Dad, no two ways about it, you
		and the whole airline are going
		down the tubes, you hear me, just
		like Braniff, you don't have a
		chance in hell, and if it isn't
		Gekko it's gonna be some other killer.

	INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	Carl steps into the elevator, Bud follows.

				CARL
		He's got your prick in his back
		pocket, son, and you're standing
		naked in the display window of
		Macy's. He's using you. Only you're
		too blind to see it.

				BUD
		No, what I see is a jealous old
		machinist who can't stand that his
		son's become more successful than
		himself.

				CARL
		What you see, son, is a man who
		never measured success by the size
		of a man's wallet.

				BUD
		That's because you never had the
		guts to go out into the world and
		stake your claim.

				CARL
			(lamentably)
		Boy, if that's what you think, I
		must've really screwed up my job as
		a father.

	INT. BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT

	Bud and Carl exit the elevator and head across the luxury
	lobby.

				CARL (CONT'D)
		...as far as being axed, I'm still
		here and as long as I am, I have a
		responsibility not just to me but
		to the union members I represent...

				BUD
			(pleading now)
		Your responsibility, Dad, is to
		present the facts, not your
		opinions, to the men... you're
		gonna destroy their lives, Dad!
		Don't do it to 'em. Give it a
		chance. Let the membership decide
		for themselves, Dad. Please.

				CARL
		I'll be damned that when my men
		come to me tomorrow morning,
		wanting to know what's going on,
		I'm going to lie to them!

				BUD
		Your men! All my life "your men"
		have been able to count on you? Why
		is it that you've never been there
		for me?

	They head through the doors, out onto the street.

	EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT

	Bud following Carl.

				BUD
		And what if you're wrong? What if
		one day, the sun didn't rise in the
		East and birds didn't fly South in
		winter and for once in your life
		your compass was off? Huh?

	He grabs Carl by the arm, stopping him.

				BUD (CONT'D)
		Would you be willing to wreck your
		men's future? My future? Please...
		Dad. Think. Be practical, for a
		change. I'm asking you, I'm fucking
		begging you...

	Bud lets go of Carl's arm. Carl looks at his son, seeing the
	desperation. Sadness and confusion take hold of him.

				CARL
		I don't sleep with no whore and I
		don't wake up with no whore. That's
		how I live with myself, Buddy. I
		don't know how you do.
			(a beat)
		I hope I'm wrong, I'll let them
		decide for themselves, that much I
		promise you.

	He walks away. Bud watches him go, knows he has won.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	Bud, increasingly frazzled and determined, dark circles
	under his eyes paces with the phone...

				JANET
			(his secretary)
		Mr. Dixon Brandt on 3...

				BUD
			(wearily switching over)
		What's up Dixon?
			(stopping, focusing)
		Calm down! What are you talking about?

						INTERCUT TO:

	INT. DIXON'S CABIN - ASPEN COLORADO - DAY

	Dixon, the rich man's son and ski bum, is yelling on the
	other end of the line.

				DIXON
		...this guy who said he was from
		the Security Exchange Commission,
		whatever the hell that is, calls
		and wants to ask me about that
		stock I bought...

				BUD
			(nervous)
		What'd you tell him?

				DIXON
		I told him I was in the bathroom
		and I'd call him right back. What
		the hell was I supposed to say
		Buddy, you got me into...

				BUD
		Look Dixon, calm down! It's not
		illegal to buy stock or to be right.
		And it's not all that unusual to be
		spot checked on a big buy. Tell him
		you did your homework and you
		thought the stock was a sound
		investment.

				DIXON
		What if he asks where I got the money?

				BUD
		Tell 'em your father gave it to you.

				DIXON
		What if they call him?

				BUD
		They won't. That's not their
		jurisdiction.

				DIXON
		You sure?

				BUD
		Yes! Read the Constitution, it's
		all in there. And remember--you
		don't know anything, nothing.

				DIXON
		I don't know anything!

				BUD
		Good. Then call him back. And call
		me back. Don't worry.

	He hangs up, a worried expression, Marv entering to break
	his concentration.

				MARV
		Hey you hear the news. I just got a
		job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat
		'em and Howe." Yuk yuk.

				BUD
			(icy)
		Didn't I tell you to knock before
		you came in here?

				MARV
		Hey the door was open.

				BUD
		Then get out and close it behind you.

				MARV
			(pause)
		You know what you need, buddy
		buddy--an optorectomy. That's when
		they cut the nerve that runs from
		your brain to your rectum--to
		change that shitty attitude of yours.

				BUD
		Get the hell out!

	Marv slams the door on his way...

	EXT. FEDERAL BUILDING - DOWNTOWN NEW YORK - DAY

	Long shot of the towering stone structure. A tall angular
	figure crosses through the glass doors with a bulky folder
	under his arm...

	INT. LOBBY - DAY

	The man flashes his ID to a SECURITY GUARD who buzzes him
	through the gate... He walks towards us and we see he is the
	familiar tall, baby-faced INVESTIGATOR from the S.E.C.
	Options Watch Office... he gets in an elevator.

	INT. S.E.C. INVESTIGATION OFFICES - DAY

	He walks into the office of a CHIEF INVESTIGATOR. A balding
	sharp-featured man in a drab suit with bags of hard work
	under his eyes looks up as the young investigator places the
	large file in front of him.

	INT. ROGER BARNES' OFFICE - DAY

	Bud enters, preoccupied. Barnes is nervous.

				BUD
		So what's the problem?

				ROGER
			(whispers)
		...got a strange call from the SEC.
		They asked to see my records...
		Bud, this is a heavy...

				BUD
			(shrugs)
		....Relax Roget
			(French pronunciation)
		You're 82M in the account numbers
		and I'm the Invisible Man...
		they're always looking for red
		flags, Gekko's always getting
		checked by them, they never come up
		with anything... we're invulnerable
		on this...

				ROGER
		Alright... I just wanna slow down
		Bud... no more calls for awhile, no
		lunches... we suspend our business,
		alright...

				BUD
		Sure Roger, whatever you want, it's
		cool.

	A young lawyer pops his head in the room.

				LAWYER
		Rog, come on, bring the cost report.
		They started.
			(exits)


				ROGER
			(standing, to Bud)
		Gekko asked us into the Bluestar
		deal. We're reviewing the
		timetables, wanna come?

				BUD
			(surprised)
		He never told me...

				ROGER
		You're just the President of the
		company, what do you know? ... Come
		on.

	As they walk out.

	INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

	Smoky, coffee cups and food. THREE LAWYERS, TWO INVESTMENT
	BANKERS, THREE COMMERCIAL BANKERS, sleeves rolled up, ties
	askew. A blackboard with Bluestar's assets diagrammed. A
	combat mood in the room. Bud walking in, feels vaguely
	worried, something is not quite right.

				ROGER
		You guys know the new chief of
		Bluestar... Bud Fox.

	They nod vaguely respectful but Bud's obviously a figure
	head to them, takes a seat off to the side. The bull-like
	INVESTMENT BANKER, Vietnam vet, in shirt and suspenders, is
	on the attack against the stuffier Commercial Bankers.

				INVESTMENT BANKER
		Look guys, what's the problem,
		let's for the kill...Gekko's got
		12% and climbing plus the unions
		are in his pocket for now,
		everybody on the street knows the
		stock's in play
			(overlapping voice:
			up 2 1/4 since the open)
		by next week the street's gonna own
		Bluestar and management won't be
		able to do anything but poison
		their own pill. Why are you guys
		dicking around? Is the bank
		financing in place or are we gonna
		have more and more meetings? Our
		firm's gonna guarantee 25% of the
		total debt structure in long-term
		junk bonds, now you guys either
		sign this piece of paper right now
		or we're gonna pull and head for
		another bank for the 75...

				COMMERCIAL BANKER
			(older man, appeasing)
		...look, we have 30 banks ready to
		participate in a 4 year revolving
		credit line but we have to have
		your assurance to pay back most of
		the loan in the first 6 months, and
		the only way...

				INVESTMENT BANKER
			(intermittently interrupting)
		... 30 banks, isn't that
		wonderful...you got it, no problem.

				COMMERCIAL BANKER
			(insistent)
		...and the only way we can see this
		happening is liquidating the
		hangars and the planes. Can you
		people guarantee that?

	Bud freezes where he sits...it all comes crashing down in a
	milli-second on that word "liquidate" -- shock now spreading
	on Bud's face...

				INVESTMENT BANKER
		Guaranteed! No sweat...we already
		got the Bleezburg brothers lined up
		to build condos where the hangars
		are, we can lay off the planes with
		Mexicana, who are dumb enough to
		buy 'em and Texas Air is drooling
		at my kneecaps to get the slots and
		the routes. What's the problem?
		it's done..

				ROGER
			(passing a paper to
			the commercial banker)
		This is the pricetag on the 737s,
		the gates, the hangars, the routes,
		we got it all nailed right down to
		the typewriters...

	Bud sits there numbly, a sickening feeling taking hold of
	him as the camera and music track and trap him tighter and
	tighter. The lawyers' voices distorting in the background.

				INVESTMENT BANKER
		...'course the beauty of it is the
		overfunded pension fund. Gekko gets
		the 75 million in there. Fifty
		million buys him the minimum
		annuities for 6,000 employees and
		he walks away with the rest. All
		in, he'll net 60 to 70 million. Not
		bad for a month's work.
			(to Bud)
		Your man did his homework, Fox,
		you're gonna have the shortest
		executive career since the Pope who
		got poisoned...now he'll really
		start believing he's "Gekko the
		Great."

	INT. RECEPTION AREA - GEKKO'S OFFICE - DAY

	Bud walks intently past the receptionist and down the long
	white marble hall.

	INT. NATALIE'S DESK - DAY

	Natalie is on the phone. Bud marches past her desk.

				NATALIE
		Yes, he wants to change that
		appointment to...
			(cupping the receiver)
		Bud--you can't go in there. He's in
		a meeting!

	He ignores her and throws open Gekko's door.

	INT. GEKKO'S OFFICE - DAY

	Gekko is talking with the LAWYERS and BANKERS from the
	Bluestar deal, as Bud barges in.

				GEKKO
			(looks up)
		I didn't know we had a meeting
		schedule for this morning.

				BUD
		I'm sorry, this can't wait.

	Gekko stares at him with piercing eyes.

				GEKKO
		Will you gentlemen excuse us for a
		few minutes?

	The lawyers and bankers get up and discreetly leave the room.
	Gekko waits for them to go, turns back to Bud.

				GEKKO
		What the hell do you want?

				BUD
		I found out about the garage sale
		down at Bluestar. Why?

	Gekko is taken by surprise.

				GEKKO
		Last night I read Rudy the story of
		Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot.
		Know what happened: he stuck his
		nose in that honey pot once too
		often and got stung.

				BUD
		Maybe you ought to read him
		Pinocchio. You told me you were
		going to turn Bluestar around. Not
		upside down. You used me.

				GEKKO
		You're walking around blind without
		a cane, sport. A fool and his money
		are lucky to get together in the
		first place.

				BUD
		Why do you need to wreck this company?

				GEKKO
		Because it's wreckable. I took
		another look and I changed my mind.

				BUD
		If these people lose their jobs,
		nowhere to go. My father worked at
		Bluestar for twenty-four years. I
		gave 'em my word.

				GEKKO
			(hard)
		It's all about bucks, kid, the rest
		is conversation...
			(loosening)
		Bud, you're still going to be
		president. And when the time comes,
		you'll parachute out a rich man.
		With the money you're going to
		make, your father won't have to
		work another day in his life.

				BUD
		Tell me, Gordon--when does it all
		end? How many yachts can you
		waterski behind? How much is enough?

				GEKKO
		Buddy, it's not a question of
		enough. It's a zero sum game, sport.
		Somebody wins and somebody loses.
		Money itself isn't lost or made,
		it's simply transferred from one
		perception to another. Like magic.
		That painting cost $60,000 10 years
		ago. I could sell it today for
		$600,000. The illusion has become
		real. And the more real it becomes,
		the more desperately they want it.
		Capitalism at its finest.

				BUD
			(again)
		How much is enough Gordon?

				GEKKO
		The richest one percent of this
		country owns half the country's
		wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One
		third of that comes from hard work,
		two thirds of it comes from
		inheritance, interest on interest
		accumulation to widows and idiot
		sons and what I do -- stock and
		real estate speculation. It's
		bullshit. Ninety percent of the
		American people have little or no
		net worth. I create nothing; I own.
		We make the rules, Buddy, the news,
		war, peace, famine, upheaval; the
		cost of a paper clip.
			(picking one up)
		We pull the rabbit out of the hat
		while everybody else sits around
		their whole life wondering how we
		did it...
			(crosses to Bud)
		...you're not naive enough to think
		we're living in a democracy are
		you, Buddy? It's the free market.
		You're one of us now...take
		advantage of it. You got the killer
		instinct, kid, stick with me. I got
		things to teach you...

				BUD
		Obviously...

	As he puts his arm around Bud, leading him to the door.

				GEKKO
		Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna
		discuss this with you at the right
		time. Look, why don't you calm down
		and come to the apartment for
		dinner tonight. Bring Darien...

				BUD
			(at the door,
			confused, drained)
		...I can't make it tonight.

				GEKKO
		Are you with me Buddy?

	At the door, a look of unmistakable power...and danger.

				GEKKO
		I want you with me.
			(waits)


				BUD
		I'm with you Gordon...

	He walks out the door, the misery he is in washing his brow.

				GEKKO
			(to Natalie)
		...be another minute, Natalie.

	As he crosses back to the coffee table and punches up a
	phone number.

				GEKKO
		This is Gordon Gekko. Now...
			(a beat, with
			controlled rage)
		I want zip-locked mouths on
		Bluestar, or I'm gonna personally
		come down there and rip out your
		fucking throats!

	EXT. GEKKO OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

	Bud walks out, heading up the street, absent amid the
	scurrying mid-day hordes tearing up the street for the loot
	inside.

	EXT. BUD'S CONDO - DAY

	Darien approaches, carrying groceries, enters the building.

	INT. BUD'S CONDO - DAY

	Bud is slumped on the couch, a spent bottle of tequila in
	front of him. Outside the twilight is quickening into night,
	shadows, scurrying across the unlit room.... for the first
	time we see him sucking on a cigarette.

	Darien opens the door and freezes, surveying the living room.
	A broken vase on the carpet, a curtain ripped off a window,
	a painting upended, a chair overturned, selected but not
	frenzied damage...

				DARIEN
		Bud?...What's going on?

	She puts down the grocery bags, frightened.

				BUD
		I've been played like a grand-
		piano--by the master, Gekko the
		Great...and today was the big crash.
		Liquidation sale. He's gonna carve
		Bluestar into little pieces and
		sell it all off...

	Darien registering this, is picking up pieces of the broken
	vase.

				DARIEN
		I'm sorry. I was afraid something
		like this could happen.

				BUD
		Talk about being bent over the sink
		of life and being dry humped. I
		handed it to him on a silver
		platter. I told my father and those
		people...

				DARIEN
		Buddy, it's not your fault, and
		it's not your decision.

				BUD
			(evenly)
		I'm not gonna let it happen Darien.

	She stops, lights a cigarette, growing concern.

				DARIEN
		Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you.
		You've worked hard to get where you
		are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar
		someone else will; and who's to say
		they won't do the same thing.

				BUD
		At least I wouldn't be pulling the
		trigger.

	She sighs...comes over, tries to shake some sense into him!

				DARIEN
		Are you mad! Why are you doing this!
		We're so close, the town is going
		to be ours. Don't throw away your
		future Bud!

				BUD
		I can stay with the brokerage firm.
		And you're doing fine. We can
		survive without Gordon Gekko.

				DARIEN
			(pointed)
		I'm not looking to just survive.
		I've been doing that all my life.

				BUD
			(getting the drift)
		What the hell's that supposed to mean?

	Darien moves out from his approximate circle, wrestling with
	what she wants to say...until she turns and says it.

				DARIEN
		That if you make an enemy of Gordon
		Gekko, I won't be there to stand by
		you.

	Bud is stunned...and hurt.

				BUD
		You really mean that?
			(lashing out)
		What'd he promise you? To take you
		public? I guess without Gordon's
		money and seal of approval, I'm not
		such a hot investment anymore.
		You're just the best money can buy,
		Darien...

				DARIEN
		You're not exactly pure Bud, you
		went after Gekko with the same
		vengeance you went after me. Look
		in the mirror before...

				BUD
			(glaring at her)
		I'm looking...and I sure don't like
		what I see.

	She collects her things and walks to the door.

				DARIEN
		Fair enough...but it's not that
		simple, Bud. When I was down and
		had nothing, it was Gordon who
		helped me. He got me all my
		clients -- you among them...
			(snaps her fingers)
		and he can take it away like that.
			(a beat)
		You may find out one day -- that
		when you've had money and lost it,
		it's worse than never having had it
		at all.

	Bud steps across to her in a rage.

				BUD
		That's bullshit! Step out that
		door, I'm changing the locks.

	She opens the door saddened.

				DARIEN
		You may not believe this Bud but I
		really do care for you. I think we
		could've made a good team...but
		that's how it goes...

				BUD
		Get the hell out!

	She does. Bud stares at the closed door, mute, numb, totally
	devastated.... the loss is not just Darien, it is total...
	He looks at his face in the reflection of a wall mirror...

	INT. BUD'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - DAY

	Waiting for the elevator. Darien also looks at herself a
	beat in the hall mirror. She's crying. Then she steels
	herself and enters the elevator.

	INT. BUD'S CONDO - DAY

	The same realtor, SYLVIe DRIMMER, who sold him the place, is
	back. The phone is ringing, unanswered...

				SYLVIE
		...well, the market's dead, hon,
		even the rich are bitching,
		nothing's moving except termites
		and cockroaches, and with my
		commission being what it is...

				BUD
			(cutting her off)
		Save the rap, just sell it -- fast!

	He's in his socks, unshaven, smoking, he looks like he's
	been on a bender for the weekend. The phone stops ringing.
	He turns and walks into the bedroom, slamming the door
	behind him.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	Bud walks in, a different, more serious look in his eye,
	purposeful. Past CAROLYN and JANET at the outer desk. They
	stop what they're doing and look up at him surprised.

				CAROLYN
		Bud! Where you been the last two days?

				BUD
			(ignoring the tone in
			her voice)
		...Janet get my father on the phone
		and the two other union reps,
		urgent...

	He notices her face, something's wrong.

				JANET
		Your mom just called, Mr. Fox. Your
		father... he...

				BUD
			(sensing it)
		What! What happened?!

				CAROLYN
		He had a heart attack, hon, but
		he's okay, he's at the hospital...

				BUD
			(runs out)
		Oh Christ!
	 
INT. BUD'S BMW - DAY

	Bud weaving fast through traffic.

	INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

	Bud races past the nurses' desks and down the hallway.

	EXT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

	Bud's MOTHER is outside with Dominick Amato and another
	neighbor just visiting, bringing candies.

				BUD
			(lighting a cigarette)
		Mom! How is he?

				MOM
			(shaken)
		...he was complaining about chest
		pains at work. Next thing I know he
		collapsed... Oh Buddy, talk to him,
		he's so stubborn.

				AMATO
			(to Bud)
		...don't worry, he's got another 20
		years in him. He's a tough ol' nut,
		your Dad...

	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

	The blinds are drawn. His Dad lies there, tubes down his
	nose, hooked up to an IV unit and monitors. Bud comes over.
	Carl, glassy-eyed, significantly frailer, nods to him. It's
	obvious that more damage was done than Bud expected. Mom
	comes into the room with him, stands there.

				BUD
		Hiya Dad...
			(sits, smiles)
		What was it? Mom talked too much or
		was it her spaghetti? I mean
		pasta...
			(Mom bringing a
			handkerchief to her eyes)
		I told you never to lift a 747 by
		yourself...

	Carl, smiles weakly, on pain killers. Bud pulls out a
	cigarette. He fumbles with it before putting it away, trying
	to keep a gruff tone between them.

				BUD
		...you even got me smoking
		now...second one Dad, you're
		pushing your luck, I guess you know
		that...I guess you gotta pull
		through this one Dad...for mom, for
		me...I guess I never told you
		but...I love you Dad, I love you
		more than I ever.
			(begins to weep)
		...I didn't mean those things I
		said to you...you're a hero all the
		way Dad, you're a rock...the best.

	The words seem to come flowing out of Bud as Carl's eyes
	fill with tears.

				BUD
		...and you were right about Gekko.
		He's one son of a bitch...through
		and through.

	Carl stares at him, beginning to understand.

				BUD (CONT'D)
		He's gonna break up Bluestar.

	Carl reacts violently in his eyes but Bud soothes him...in
	dead earnest, trying to be deliberate and clear in his meaning.

				BUD (CONT'D)
		...but I gotta plan Dad, it can
		work, I can save the airline, I
		know you got no reason to believe
		me but I want you to trust me...I
		need to talk to the unions...Can I
		speak for you?

	Carl's eyes.

				BUD (CONT'D)
		Your words, not mine...

				CARL
			(weakly)
		You speak for me, son.

	INT. AUCTION ROOM - DAY

	Gekko and Darien are seated together in the back row. Darien
	looks serious and distracted in spite of all the excitement
	going on around her. It is the big spring Impressionist sale
	and all the major players, or their representatives are here.
	Gekko is bidding.

				GEKKO
		Look over there sunshine. I'm up
		against Richard Feigen.

	He is on a roll, electric. As the price mounts and surpasses
	the two million dollar mark, Gekko rises and walks down the
	side aisle to the front, never taking his eyes away from the
	auctioneer. He stands agressively, arms akimbo, in a nose to
	nose confrontation.

				AUCTIONEER
		Once, twice, three times. Sold to
		Mr. Gordon Gekko.

	EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF AUCTION HOUSE - DAY

	They walk the sunny streets, a jubilant Gekko, savoring his
	triumph, grabs Darien's arm.

				GEKKO
		What do you say we go get a suite
		at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne?
		Celebrate, just like the old times
		Sunshine.

				DARIEN
			(indignantly)
		Those days are over, Gordon. They
		were over a long time ago.

				GEKKO
			(condescendingly but
			paying little
			attention to the rebuff)
		Can't blame me for trying. You look
		as beautiful as that painting I
		just bought.

	He pats her on the back in a preprietary fashion.

				GEKKO (CONT'D)
			(mockingly)
		So what's the problem Sunshine? You
		look like Black Thursday. Bad case
		of puppy love?

				DARIEN
			(indignant)
		It's not puppy love, Gordon.
		Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.

				GEKKO
			(off handed)
		Sorry to hear that. I thought the
		kid had staying power.

				DARIEN
		It's over you, Gordon.

				GEKKO
			(cooly)
		You told him about us?

				DARIEN
		No, are you crazy? And I don't want
		him ever to know. Do you
		understand?...

	She moves closed and takes Gordon's hand.

				DARIEN (CONT'D)
		I want to ask you a big favor,
		Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.

				GEKKO
			(stroking her face)
		Now tell me, why would I want to do
		that?

				DARIEN
		Because I don't want to see him hurt.

				GEKKO
		Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had
		a little talk. We came to an
		understanding.
			(takes her hand paternally)
		I want you to go back to him.
		Soothe him. Help keep his head
		straight. Okay?

				DARIEN
		I can't...and I won't.

				GEKKO
		Come on, we both like Buddy. But
		this bleeding heart puppy love act
		is over the top... It doesn't fit.

				DARIEN
		Maybe it does. Don't patronize me
		Gordon.

				GEKKO
		You and I are the same, Darien.
		We're smart enough not to buy into
		the oldest myth running: love... A
		fiction created by people who got
		nothing to keep them from jumping
		out of windows.

				DARIEN
		You're really twisted, Gordon.
		You're incapable of giving to
		anybody because deep down inside
		you there's a poverty that every
		last dollar in the world won't fill.

				GEKKO
		Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared
		little girl all wrapped in a pretty
		grown-up package. Does this mean
		you're ready to cut the umbilical
		cord and step out into the world on
		your own? Because, Darien, if
		you're through with me, you're
		through with everything I'm a part of.

	Darien's eyes cloud over...the look of a scared child being
	banished by her father. Then...

				DARIEN
		I know...but maybe, just maybe
		Gordon, I'm good enough so I don't
		need you anymore.

	She walks away.

	INT. MCGREGOR'S BAR - QUEENS - DAY

	Bud is seated at a corner table with the BLUESTAR UNION
	REPS: Duncan Wilmore, ALPA LEADER and Toni Carpenter, AFA
	rep; also jointed by machinists, Dominick Amato and Charley
	Dent, sitting in for his father's union.

				BUD
		...the stock's at 19 1/4 and it's
		going up. Gekko figures by breaking
		up Bluestar, it's worth at least
		$30 a share. That means he'll buy
		up to 23 or 24 and still think he's
		making money.

				WILMORE
		How do you know that the stock is
		going to go up?

				BUD
			(pointedly)
		You really don't want to know any
		more than that, Mr. Wilmore. Let's
		just say I have some friends.

				WILMORE
			(getting his drift)
		Okay. What happens then?

				BUD
		When the stock hits 23, you guys go
		to Gekko and lower the boom. Once
		he learns he has no union
		concession, he's going to head for
		the hills. He'll sell everything
		he's got.

				CARPENTER
		Yeah. But who's going to buy then
		and what's to prevent another shark
		from coming along and devouring us?

	INT. WILDMAN BUILDING - FIFTH AVENUE APARTMENT - DAY

	Bud, Duncan Wilmore, Toni Carpenter, Dominick and Charley,
	an unlikely looking group in the plushness of the apartment
	lobby.

				BUD
		We have an appointment to see Mr.
		Wildman.

	INT. WILDMAN APARTMENT - DAY

	Lofty windows overlooking the Park, an impeccably-decorated
	apartment with coffee and rolls laid out, a young AIDE
	quietly moving around. Bud and the others are on sofas
	around the imposing figure of Wildman in a chair across.

				BUD
		Sir Lawrence, what would you say to
		owning Bluestar Airlines with union
		concessions--at $18 a share...and
		in the process hanging Gordon Gekko
		out in the wind to twist.... ?

	Sir Lawrence leans back in his chair, equably...

				WILDMAN
		I might be very interested, but why?
		Why you mate -- how'd you get mixed
		up with Gekko? He doesn't know the
		difference between raiding and
		insider trading. I do. The SEC does.
		I hope you do...

				BUD
		Let's just say Mr. Gekko and I have
		a conflict of interest. I want to
		see this airline work...
			(pointing to the
			documents in front of Wildman)
		...the figures here show it can.

				WILDMAN
			(to the others)
		... and you're prepared to take
		these large salary cuts.

				WILMORE
		...we are. But we want a contract
		agreement -- iron-clad -- that if
		you buy it, you can't break it up.

				WILDMAN
			(hands behind his head)
		I'm still listening...

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	Bud hurries in, past Marv on the phone with an irate customer.

				MARV
		Well, if that's how you feel--the
		hell with you too. And strong
		letter to follow.

	He slams the phone down.

				BUD
		You don't have to agree with me,
		Marv; but I think I've been a bit
		of a schmuck lately.
			(beat, waits)


				MARV
			(off the cuff)
		I agree. Go thou and sin no more.

				BUD
		I want to make it up to you.
		Bluestar, put all your clients in it.

				MARV
			(animated, grabs the phone)
		Thanks, buddy, buddy, I'm back.
		Say, Buddy, those optorectomies do
		work wonders.

	Bud intersecting Lou Mannheim smoking a cigarette and having
	a hard time walking.

				BUD
		Bluestar, Mr. Mannheim. Put all
		your clients in it.

	Davls looks gravely at Bud.

				MANNHEIM
		I don't know where you get your
		information, son, but I don't like
		it. The only reason I'm gonna do it
		is...I need the money, that's the
		problem with money--it makes you do
		things you don't want to do.

	Bud hears him, walks on...

				MARV
			(into phone)
		Miss Bloom, Marvin. You got cancer
		in your portfolio, but I got the
		cure...Bluestar Airlines...

	Immediately goes back to the other line.

	INT. NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE - DAY

	A RUNNER dashes up to the BLUESTAR AIRLINES post, where a
	heated crowd is gathered, amidst heavy trading. He elbows

	holds up the buy order, screaming, making frantic hand
	signals, in search of a seller. Faces in the crowd look up
	at the broad tape.

	As he glances at his quotron the stock ticks up another 1/8th.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	All the BROKERS have jumped into the action, avidly watching

				MARV
		The stock's going to Pluto!

				BUD
		Start unloading.

				MARV
		Sell?

				BUD
		Now! Tell everyone to dump!

	Marv nods, and rushes away. Bud crosses past Mannheim's office.

		Get out of Bluestar!

	In background Marv is spreading the word, brokers frantically
	grabbing phones, calling clients to sell.

				ALEX
		They don't know what's going on!

		Everybody and his mother is buying!

	Natalie enters the room, flustered.

		outside demanding to see you.

				GEKKO
		What the hell do they want?

				WILMORE (O.S.)
		I'd be happy to tell you.

	As Duncan, Toni Carpenter, Dominick Amato, Charley Dent and
	SEVERAL other assorted UNION MEMBERS march into the room.
	Gekko is taken by surprise, but stays calm.

				WILMORE
		We know what you're up to, Gekko,
		and let me tell you this from here,
			(hits his heart)
		you suck eggs, mister, over my dead
		body you ain't gonna break up
		Bluestar.

				GEKKO
		You guys must know something nobody
		else knows. If those are my plans,
		it's the first I've heard of it.

				CARPENTER
		Would you care to put that in writing?

				GEKKO
		I'd like to remind you we already
		have an agreement, which I expect
		you to honor.

				WILMORE
		Well in that case, I hope you have
		your pilot's license.

				AMATO
		Don't worry, Gekko, we wouldn't let
		the engines fall out of the plane.

				CARPENTER
			(regretfully)
		But the reservations systems can

				WILMORE
		We'll take our chances.

		Nice to see you again, Mr. Gekko.

	They file out of the room. The phone lines have lit up like
	a Christmas tree. Alex answers a call.

		Fox says Bluestar just hit 23. What

		The big Wall Street story tonight
		is the  roller coaster ride of
		Bluestar Airlines. Fueled by
		takeover rumors, the stock soared
		to an all-time high of 24 1/8. Then
		when contradictory rumors later
		surfaced that the takeover was
		unfounded, buyers went running for
		cover, and the stock plummeted on
		gigantic volume to as low as 16 1/2
		before closing at 17.

	Camera discovers Gekko sitting, grimly watching the report.
	Rudy seen riding his toy car in background.

		According to many sources, raider
		Sir Lawrence Wildman has stepped in

		deal tomorrow at 18 that includes
		the support of the unions.

	Camera now tracks in close on Gekko as he absorbs the
	unexpected blow. O.S. Rudy yelling and squealing. Gekko
	leans back, putting the pieces together, his eyes narrowing
	into burning slits. He smashes the glass cocktail table with

	EXT. WALL STREET - MORNING

	People rushing to work. Bud crosses the street, his face

		there's nothing staring back at him.
		At that time a man finds his
		character--and that is what keeps
		him out of the abyss...
			(a beat, looks deeply)


				BUD
		I think I understand what you mean
		Mr. Mannheim.

	But not really. As, on this increasingly strange morning, he
	moves on past Janet who wants to tell his something but he
	cuts her off.

				BUD
		Get my father will you Janet?

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	As Bud walks in, the camera glides to reveal the young SEC
	INVESTIGATOR, who has been tracking Buddy, going through his
	files. A SECOND MAN, PATTERSON, is standing behind the desk
	using the phone as a bored-looking 3RD MAN and POLICEMAN
	stand off to the side with Hieronymus Lynch, who gives Bud a
	withering glance.

				PATTERSON
			(into phone)
		He just came in. I'll talk to you
		later.

	On Bud--a struck-dumb look passing to resignation, as if for
	a long time now, he has been expecting this.

				BUD
		I guess you're not here to open an
		IRA.

				PATTERSON
		Mr Fox, I'm Henry Patterson from
		the Postal Inspection Service...
		this is Evan Morrissey with The
		Securities and Exchange
		Investigation Office.
			(presents his ID and
			indicates MAN 3)
		... Mr. Ebanhopper from the US
		Attorney's Office.

				MORRISSEY
		Mr. Fox, you're under arrest for
		conspiracy to commit securities
		fraud and for violating the Insider
		Trader's Sanction Act.

	The handcuffs come out.

	EXT. SHEEPSMEADOW - CENTRAL PARK - TWILIGHT

	Long shot. Activity is winding down, a few sunbathers
	collecting their blankets. A solitary figure stands on a
	hill silhouetted by the sunset. A second figure appears on a
	footpath and starts climbing the hill towards the other man.

	Gekko waits, expressionless... Bud approaches him. They
	stand facing each other.

				GEKKO
		Hello Bud.

				BUD
		Gordon.

				GEKKO
		You sandbagged me on Bluestar.
			(smiles)
		I guess you think you taught the
		teacher a lesson, that you can make
		the tail wag the dog, huh?

	Bud looks away. Gekko's smile fades.

				GEKKO (CONT'D)
		Well let me cue you in: the ice is
		melting under your feet sport...

	Without warning, he grabs Buddy roughly by the lapels and
	lets out his inner rage with a series of smacks and slaps
	across his face.

				GEKKO (CONT'D)
		You think you could've gotten this
		far this fast with anybody else?
		You think you could be out there
		dicking somebody like Darien? No,
		you'd be cold calling dentists and
		widows to buy twenty shares of some
		dog stock! I took you in! A nobody!
		I opened doors for you!...I showed
		you how the system works!...

	Gekko slapping him harder and harder, Buddy staggering with
	the blows, saying nothing, not defending himself.

				GEKKO (CONT'D)
		...the value of information! How
		you get it! Anacott Steel, Brant
		Resources, Transuniversal, Fulham
		Oil. And this is how you pay back,
		you cockroach! I gave you Darien, I
		gave you your manhood. I gave you
		everything.

	He backhands Bud across the face. Bud lies on the ground,
	spent, as is Gordon breathing hard. Bud gets to his knees,
	blood streaming from his nose, his suit muddied. Passersby
	look on, wondering.

	Gekko seems to relent, the rage going into hurt, remorse. He
	hands Bud a handkerchief. Bud staunches the flow of blood
	from his nose.

				GEKKO (CONT'D)
			(softly, innocently)
		You could've been one of the great
		ones Bud...I look at you and see
		myself...Why?

	Bud looks at Gordon, torn by mixed emotions: the bonds they
	share and the betrayal wrought.

				BUD
			(shakes his head, thoughtfully)
		I don't know. My Dad once told me,
		"money is something you need in
		case you don't die tomortow." I
		guess I realized I'm just Bud Fox.
		And as much as I wanted to be
		Gordon Gekko--I'll always be Bud Fox.

	He looks at Gordon, as if wanting to say more, but doesn't.

	In long shot, Gordon stands alone as Bud walks away.

	EXT. TAVERN ON THE GREEN RESTAURANT - EVENING

	The DOORMAN looks askance. Bud, mud-splattered suit and
	bloody nose, walks straight past him thru the door.

	INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Several well-heeled DINERS look up from their haute cuisine,
	at the sight of Bud making his way toward the men's room.

	INT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Tight on Bud, staring at his reflection in the mirror, as he
	unbuttons his shirt, revealing adhesive tape swathed across
	his chest. Camera paces back as he winces when...

	MORRISSEY and AGOSTINI, the two investigators, rip the tape
	off his chest, retrieving a small tape recorder. Morrissey
	of the S.E.C. rewinds the cassette. We hear Gekko's voice
	being played back on the tape, the mention of their deals.

				MORRISSEY
		You did the right thing, Bud.

	Bud looks searchingly in the mirror. Faint CLICKING NOISE
	comes up over the shot.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	CLICKING of the Broad Tape grows LOUDER. Shots of Lou
	Mannheim, Lynch, Marv; silently looking up at the green
	fluorescent print-out.

	THE TAPE--THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TODAY ANNOUNCED
	CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST CORPORATE RAIDER GORDON GEKKO AND
	STOCK BROKER BUD FOX, FOR CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT SECURITIES
	FRAUD, TAX EVASION, VIOLATIONS OF SECURITY ACTS, AND MAIL

	INT. CARL FOX'S HOUSE - QUEENS - DAY

	Carl, dressed in a suit and tie, sits at the dining table,
	finished breakfast plates in front of him, refilling his
	coffee cup. Mom clearing off the table, anxious...

	As Bud walks in, wearing a suit and tie. He looks tired,
	beaten, the eyes lifeless, in a dark mood.

				MOM
			(disapproving)
		...don't wear that tie Buddy, it...

	She cuts off on Bud's look.

				CARL
		Another cup of coffee?

				BUD
		No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.

				CARL
			(checks his watch)
		I guess it's time to hit the road.

				BUD
		Yeah, don't want to be late for my
		own funeral.

	INT. CARL FOX'S SEDAN - LOWER MANHATTAN - DAY

	Driving towards the Federal Courtrooms in Lower Manhattan.
	Busy traffic all around.

				CARL
			(supportively)
		...you told the truth, you gave the
		money back. All things considered--
		in this cockamamie world--you're
		shooting par...

				MOM
		...you helped save the airline and
		the people at the airline are gonna
		remember you for it.

				CARL
		...if I was you, I'd think about
		that Bluestar job Wildman's offered
		you...

				BUD
		Dad, I'm going to jail and you know
		it.

				CARL
			(shaking his head, sober)
		Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe
		so. It's gonna be rough on you but
		maybe in some screwed up way,
		that's the best thing that can
		happen to you...stop trading for
		the quick buck and go produce
		something with your life, create,
		don't live off the buying and
		selling of others...

				MOM
		...you can do it, Bud, once you set
		your mind to something, I believe
		you can do anything in the world...

	Bud stares ahead, registering it.

				CARL
			(nods, then)
		...got any friends gonna be there?

	As he pulls the car into the curb. The Federal Building, in
	approaching POV, looms large before them.

				BUD
			(looks around, ironic)
		Like who? Who really wants to know
		a convicted felon...I don't even
		like myself.

	Carl knows something Bud doesn't...

	Darien is standing there waiting as they approach the main
	entrance... Bud seeing her, suddenly stunned. His POV--
	easing along the curb.

				CARL
		So, why don't you get out here and
		go in with your friend, I'll park
		the car. Try to be cool, okay?

	A last look with his father.

	EXT. CURBSIDE - FEDERAL BUILDING - LOWER MANHATTAN - DAY

	Bud getting out...crossing to Darien. A pause.

				DARIEN
			(nervous)
		Hi.

				BUD
		Why?

				DARIEN
		I figure a guy who's made some
		mistakes should be able to
		understand a girl who's made some
		of her own...

	Bud looking at her, moves closer, longing and hope and
	happiness have returned to his dull eyes... and forgiveness,
	the greatest of all.

	They embrace. Bud will never know about her past, nor need
	he. The camera leaving them on a slanting, circular crane,
	lifting past the Federal Building to a panorama of Wall
	Street in all its icy magisterial splendor...and thus ends
	our tale.

          A BLACK SCREEN
          Onto which is written in white letters...

          "When business in the United States underwent a
          contraction... the Federal Reserve created more paper
          reserves.

          The excess credit spilled over into the market triggering a
          fantastic speculative boom... "



          EXT. CLINTON CORRECTIONAL FACILITY - DAY

          It's a summer day. The heat floats above the pavement.
          A cab waits in the lot.

          The large gates of New York's largest prison open and today's
          group of newly released emerge.

          They pass a guard who lifts up a copy of The USA Today to
          reveal the headlines and date that tells us it's 2002.
          Amongst this group we find a man carrying a small duffel.
          And we know this man. He is Gordon Gekko.

          But he is not as slick as we remember... he doesn't have that
          gleam in his eyes or that gel in his hair. No, this is a
          very different version of the man we remember... because now
          there's nothing behind those eyes... nothing we can read
          anyway.

          And he just stands there... coldly watching his recently
          freed brethren greet their wives and children... reuniting
          with the people who waited for them... the people who love
          them.

          The cab slowly pulls up and Gordon holds up a finger... wait
          a minute. He glares over to the entrance of the lot...
          waiting for his people... but they don't come.

          And the cab waits... Gordon stands there... in the heat...
          completely disappointed... and completely alone.
          And we...

          SLAM BACK INTO
          As the white letters reappear on the screen...
          "As a result... the American economy collapsed...
          Taken from an article about the pre-crash 1929...
          ... written by Alan Greenspan."

                          JACOB (V.O.)
           It's funny, the more we find ourselves
           slaves of chance... the more
           superstitious we become.

           2.

                         

                         

          SLAM INTO: A MANHATTAN MORNING
          A gorgeous June Friday.

                          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           And that would make Andrew Zabel one
           superstitious motherfucker.

          Find ANDREW ZABEL, mid 50s, shaved-head and in good shape.

                          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           He started every day the same exact
           way. He would walk his dogs then
           leave his Gramercy Park condo at seven
           am on the dot.

          As Andrew leaves 36 East Gramercy Park East, an impressive
          building made of white stone.
          Andrew wears a suit and holds an umbrella.

                          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           And he would take an umbrella with him
           even when there was no chance of
           rain...

          As Andrew heads to a newsstand and throws the INDIAN CLERK a
          familiar nod. And without saying a word, the clerk knows
          exactly what to give him.

                          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           He'd buy a journal, a tin of chocolate
           Altoids and a cold bottle of Poland
           Springs water.

          23RD ST SUBWAY STATION
          As Andrew bounds down the stairs and through the gate...

                          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           He had timed it out so he wouldn't
           have to wait more than three minutes
           for the uptown five train.

          As Andrew emerges out to the platform and sees the headlight
          from the 5 train coming down the tunnel.

                          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           I guess you could say that day was
           like every other...

          And as the train approaches... holding that Wall Street
          Journal... the bottle of water and that tin of Altoids...

                          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Except for one thing...

          ... Andrew Zabel simply steps forward and falls onto the
          track.

           3.

                         

                         
          And as the train SLAMS into US...

                         DARKNESS
          Which holds for an uncomfortably long moment, then...
          "Money Never Sleeps" graces the screen... and we move down
          below the letters to find...

                         A CHART
          Now filling the screen. It's of the Dow Jones Industrial
          Average. It's for the year 2008 and it's down to the
          right... not good.
          A circle marks Friday June 13th. Follow a blue line back
          three days and stop. Another circle is now formed and
          Matthew Good's "Giant" rings out...
          CARD: JUNE 6th 2008... 8 DAYS EARLIER...

                         MIDTOWN
          Opening titles... the workplace throng... listening to their
          iPods, checking their Blackberrys and sipping their
          Starbucks.

          Move with this throng, to the Matthew Good tune, under the
          opening titles, past 745 Seventh Avenue, the Lehman Brothers
          building... with that giant ticker that rounds the building
          posting Dow 12,579.76 -- +119.86

          And keep moving... all is normal in the financial center of
          the universe.

          Land on a impressive modern building made of glass and steel
          then climb up it to the top... to the penthouse office
          suites.

          And push in through the window to be in...

          INT. KELLER, ZABEL INVESTMENTS/ANDREW ZABEL'S OFFICE - DAY

          An impressive office with a 180 degree view of southern
          Manhattan. Zabel sits behind his desk.

                          ZABEL
           Go ahead, open it.
          And across from Andrew Zabel sits JACOB L. MOORE... who holds
          his bonus check.

                          JACOB
           Really?
          On the wall over Zabel's shoulder runs an electronic ticker
          with the major indices and just one stock... ticker KZI...
          Keller Zabel Investments.

           4.

                         

                         

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           I thought that because of the problems
           with the credi--

                          ZABEL
           Screw the credit derivative desk, I
           don't understand half the shit they do
           anyway.
          Zabel forces a smile. But Jacob can tell something's wrong
          with him.

                          JACOB
           Are you okay?
          Zabel doesn't answer... he just nods to the envelope.

                          ZABEL
           Open it.
          He opens the envelope and looks down at the check.
          $1,450,000. And he can barely contain his excitement.

                          JACOB
           Thank you.
          And we get a good look at Jacob now... boyish features that
          display humility with a trace of mischievousness thrown in.
          He's definitely sexy, definitely cerebral and definitely
          winning.

                          ZABEL
           I'm proud of you, Jacob.
          And Jacob tries to play it cool as he looks up at the
          electronic ticker on the wall... 12,592.46 -- +132.46... KZI

          $71.67... +$3.12.

          Jacob inspects the ring then looks up to the fey salesman.

                          JACOB
           Yeah, it's nice. But here's the
           thing...
          He looks around the store for a moment, then...

           5.

                         

                         

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           I want to see the "fuck you" room.

                          SALESMAN
           The "fuck you" room?

                          JACOB
           Yes. The room where you sell me a

                          SALESMAN
           The private client foyer.
          And with a big smile...

                          JACOB
           What did I say?

          INT. JACOB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Two bedroom in a Murray Hill high rise. Jacob watches Fox
          Business on his tv. A much nicer, much bigger, much flatter
          plasma sits against the wall under it waiting to be
          installed.
          A promo plays for a magazine show being narrated by Cody
          Willard.

           CODY WILLARD (ON TV)
           Tomorrow night we explore the excesses
           of hedge fund managers.
          Different pictures flash on the screen of private jets,
          massive mansions, expensive watches and wines.

           CODY WILLARD (ON TV) (CONT'D)
           Whether they're spraying $5000 a
           bottle champagne at Voile Rouge in
           Saint-Tropez, ordering a $10,000
           Martini at The Algonquian Hotel with a
           diamond on the bottom or eating a gold
           dusted $175 hamburger at the Wall
           Street Burger Shoppe...
          Now the flashes are of some of the top HEDGE FUND MANAGERS in
          the business that we'll see later... one of them is a man
          named BRETTON WOODS... maybe we hold a little longer on him
          to get a good look... Mid 40s, good looking and refined.

           CODY WILLARD (ON TV) (CONT'D)
           ... these cowboys of finance always
           seem to land on their feet.
          Jacob lets out a little laugh and mutes the tv.
          He grabs the phone and makes a call...

           6.

                          (INTO PHONE)
           I know you're at the fund raiser
           tonight but I wanted to say hi.

                          (BEAT)
           Okay, best part... getting my bonus
           check. Worst part...
          He grabs a framed picture of her and looks at it.
          She's in workout gear, wearing earbuds, obviously just off a
          run, caught off guard and thus flipping him the finger...
          it's adorable.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

                          (INTO PHONE)
           ... it was right after I ordered lunch
           and I remembered that we're not seeing
           each other this weekend.
          And he finishes his message to her...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

                          (INTO PHONE)
           Okay, text me yours and I'll read them
           in my sleep. I love you.
          As Jacob disconnects and looks out the window... looking out
          at Third Avenue twinkling up into Midtown.

          INT. KELLER, ZABEL INVESTMENTS/TRADING FLOOR - MORNING

          A large space lined with long desks that hold five TRADERS
          each. Each trader has two phones and three huge monitors in
          front of them.
          It's loud and frenetic. Most of the traders are under thirty-
          five, it's a young person's game.
          Jacob heads in and takes his seat at his desk. It's larger
          than the others and anchors the room... this is his domain.
          Fox Business plays on each of the screens that line the space
          ubiquitous. (A note, when possible, business news will be
          droning from television sets throughout this movie in bg...
          as it is the current soundtrack of New York these days)
          A trader named WILLY shouts out...

                          WILLY
           Jake, Glass Works is up nine points on
           earnings, you want to unload some?

           7.

                         

                         
          Jacob confirms...

                          JACOB
           Yeah, let's get closer to home.
          A trader named AUDRY turns to Jacob.

                          AUDRY
           (to Jacob, re Willy)
           Where's his hat?
          Willy glares at her.

                          WILLY
           Mind your own business, Audry.

                          AUDRY
           I had to wear Pfizer on my forehead
           for a full week... so post it up,
           bitch.
          Willy pleads with Jacob...

                          WILLY
           C'mon Jake, it's embarrassing.
          Jacob just shrugs...

                          JACOB
           The stock goes down, you wear the
           crown... them's the rules.
          Audry grins in victory.
          Willy shakes his head, grabs a marker, scribbles something
          down on a post-it then places it on his forehead. It reads
          "I bought Toll Brothers at $24" and he has to wear it all
          week.
          And Jacob laughs... now looking up at the electronic
          ticker... KZI $60.21... -$2.25...

          INT. ONE OAK - NIGHT

          An ultra exclusive club reserved for Wall Street money-men,
          Hollywood players, gangstas and supermodels.
          TI's "Whatever You Like" blares.
          The dance floor is packed with New York's privileged draped
          in Prada and dripped in sweat.
          Jacob heads a table of five men who are all in suits. They
          are all in various areas of finance... a HEDGE FUND Portfolio
          Manager, a DERIVATIVES TRADER, a PRIVATE EQUITY CFO and a

          QUANT ANALYST.
          The quant stares at a HIGH CLASS CALL GIRL working the room
          across the way. He then turns back to the guys with...

           8.

                         

                         

                          QUANT ANALYST
           Girl like that cost a thousand bucks
           last year... now it's up to five.

                          JACOB
           Getting priced out of the hooker
           bubble?
          Confirming in frustration...

                          QUANT ANALYST
           Goddamn bull market's killing my sex
           life.
          They all laugh.

           HEDGE FUND PM
           Don't worry... it's not such a bull
           market anymore. She'll be trading at
           five hundred soon enough.
          The laughter dies down.

                          DERIVATIVES TRADER
           (turning to Jacob)
           It's true. I'm actually shocked KZI
           gave you a bonus of that size.

                          JACOB
           Why?
          Private Equity CFO nudges Hedge Fund PM in reference to the
          woman who just took the seat at the next table...

           HEDGE FUND PM

                          (DISMISSIVE)
           Yeah, I'm going long Boeing.

           PRIVATE EQUITY CFO
           Oh, I didn't notice.
          Confused...

                          QUANT ANALYST
           Really? The 787 is having problems.
          As Hedge Fund PM opens a bottle of Krug, Clos du Mesnil 1995
          and pours it into the flutes.

                          JACOB
           (to Derivatives Trader)
           Why? Why are you so shocked?
          Offering Jacob a flute...

           HEDGE FUND PM
           Because they're in serious trouble.
          Declining the champagne...

           9.

                         

                         

                          JACOB
           We're not in serious trouble.
           It's a rumor.
          A woman takes the table next to them and this makes
          Derivatives Trader perk up and say.

                          DERIVATIVES TRADER
           I think Goodyear Tire is definitely a
           buy.
          Hedge Fund PM checks out the woman.

           HEDGE FUND PM
           Totally. And those tires are real.
          Even more confused...

                          QUANT ANALYST
           Goodyear? The chart is horrible.

           PRIVATE EQUITY CFO
           Somebody color the quant in here.
          Hedge Fund PM leans into Quant and explains...

           HEDGE FUND PM
           Boeing, ticker BA... Big Ass.
           Goodyear, ticker GT... Great Tits.

                          QUANT ANALYST
           (realizing...)
           Oh, it's like a code.
          And Private Equity CFO turns to Jacob with...

           QUANT ANALYST (CONT'D)
           You guys were down three points in an
           up market today.

                          JACOB
           Whatever, somebody was adding to their
           short.
          As a supermodel now joins the next table.

           HEDGE FUND PM DERIVATIVES TRADER
          Going long Starwood. Starwood's a buy!

                          QUANT ANALYST
           (figuring it out)
           Starwood, ticker HOT. Yeah but... I'm
           more a buyer of...
           (thinks for a minute)

           GDFS.

           PRIVATE EQUITY CFO
           What the fuck is that?

           10.

                         

                         

                          QUANT ANALYST
           It's an exchange traded fund that
           tracks the Guinian Franc.

           HEDGE FUND PM
           Okay, whatever -- what's it code for?
          And Quant looks over to the model then back proudly with...

                          QUANT ANALYST
           Gold Digger Freak Show.
          The guys just shake their heads...

          EXT. LOWER BROADWAY - NIGHT

          Jacob and Derivatives Trader enjoy the summer night. Out of
          all the guys, he's closest to Jacob. His name is Robby.

                          JACOB
           Can I ask you something, Robby?
          Robby nods.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           What's your number?

                          ROBBY
           Huh?

                          JACOB
           You know what I mean. The amount of
           money you would need to fuck it all
           and walk away... if you wanted to.

                          ROBBY
           Do you want to walk away?

                          JACOB
           Not now. But one day... I don't know.
           When I have a family. It's just so
           consuming... so many marriages get

                          FUCKED UP--

                          ROBBY
           Wall Street divorce lawyers do great
           in any market.

                          JACOB
           Exactly.

                          (BEAT)
           I've thought about it. What I would
           need... to raise a family, live a good
           life, be secure. It's not as much as
           we would think if you move out of New
           York.
          And it dawns on Robby...

           11.

                         

                         

                          ROBBY
           Aha... when did you buy the ring?
          Jacob smiles at his friend's perception.

                          JACOB
           Last week.

                          ROBBY
           So when are you going to ask her?

                          JACOB
           I'm going to DC this weekend.

                          ROBBY
           Good. I like her for you. She's one
           of the good ones...

                          (BEAT)
           Did you hear what her father said on
           Charlie Rose?
          Jacob shakes his head.

                          ROBBY (CONT'D)
           Something about Bear Stearns being the
           first rain drop of the impending
           mother of all storms.

                          JACOB
           Sour grapes.

                          ROBBY
           He's speaking at Columbia on Friday.
           If it's slow enough, a few of us might
           play hookie and check it out... he's
           the best show in town.
          And they continue to walk, until...

                          JACOB
           Tell me what you hear.
          Robby slowly nods...

                          ROBBY
           I don't think you want to hear it,
           bro. You worship Zabel and it's not
           good.

                          JACOB
           I don't worship him. He's done a lot
           for me and I've known him a long time.
           But he's been acting strange lately.

                          (BEAT)
           Just tell me what you hear.

                          ROBBY
           That Keller Zabel is holding toxic
           waste they can't find a market for.

           12.

                         

                         
          Jacob shakes his head...

                          JACOB
           It's not true. It's rumors. There
           are hedge funds with huge short
           positions...

                          ROBBY
           Jacob, you know better. You know it
           doesn't matter if they're rumors or
           not.
          And Robby stops walking.

                          ROBBY (CONT'D)
           Senior year I couldn't get my mind
           around how all those dot coms with no
           earnings were worth billions of
           dollars and you were the one who said
           something that made it all clear for
           me.

                          JACOB
           I don't remember.
          Turning to Jacob with...

                          ROBBY
           "An asset's value can only be priced
           at its perception."

                          JACOB
           I said that?
          Robby confirms... then...

                          ROBBY
           So buddy -- it don't matter if the
           rumors are true or not. Because in
           this climate... if they exist at
           all... then most likely...
          Looking his friend head on...

                          ROBBY (CONT'D)
           ... you're going to cease to.

          EXT. 533 THIRD AVENUE - MORNING

          Jacob leaves his Murray Hill building apartment and nods to
          his doorman, DIEGO.

                          DIEGO
           J to the Acob -- morning to you,
           brother.
          Jacob smiles...

                          JACOB
           Diego...

           13.

                         

                         
          And Jacob waits for the morning joke.

                          DIEGO
           Okay, what's the best aphrodisiac on
           Wall Street?

                          JACOB
           I don't know.

                          DIEGO
           Jet fuel.
          Diego cracks up. Jacob just shakes his head and moves on.
          And Jacob walks uptown... deep in thought. It's a gorgeous
          June Friday.
          Suddenly, Jacob just stops walking and stands there for a
          long moment... coming to a decision.
          And as Jacob turns around and starts heading the other way...

          INT. 36 GRAMERCY PARK EAST/LOBBY - MORNING

          Jacob smiles to the doorman.

                          JACOB
           I'm here to see Andrew Zabel.

                          DOORMAN
           Is he expecting you?

                          JACOB
           No.

          INT. LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

          The elevator opens and Andrew Zabel appears with two adorable
          Bichon Frise puppies. Jacob stands.

                          ZABEL
           Jacob...

                          JACOB
           Andy. I'm sorry to come by like this
           but the rumors are now hitting a fever
           pitch and I wanted to make sure
           everything was okay.
          Zabel nods and heads for the door.

                          ZABEL
           Come on...

          EXT. GRAMERCY PARK - MORNING

          As they enter through the gates of the park and walk...

           14.

                         

                         

                          JACOB
           Is everything okay?
          And Andrew Zabel doesn't seem all there... introspective and
          blank.

                          ZABEL
           I remember when the starter gave me
           this bushy hair twelve year old kid
           and I said; "Donny, what the fuck --
           give me a real caddy." And he said;
           "This kid's the best."

                          JACOB

                          ANDY--

                          ZABEL
           And you were. You had the wind down,
           the grade of every green.

                          JACOB
           What's going on?

                          ZABEL
           But you wouldn't shut up about stocks.
           Twelve years old and you blabbed on
           and on about companies and sectors and
           earnings.

                          JACOB
           Andy, are we going under?

                          ZABEL
           What was that piece of shit you loved?
           That airline equipment supplier who
           was branching out into car airbags--

                          JACOB
           Flour Controls. Are you okay?
          Zabel laughs.

                          ZABEL
           Flour Controls... what a dog.

                          JACOB
           Why did you give me that bonus?
          Zabel stops walking and faces Jacob with...

                          ZABEL
           Because I know you, Jacob. And I know
           you've been holding off because you
           didn't think you had enough. We all
           do that... postpone life until we
           believe we have what it takes to
           actually live it.

           15.

                         

                         

                          JACOB
           There isn't a better money-runner on
           the street... we'll get through this.

                          ZABEL
           Marry her, Jacob. And have children
           with her and spend as much time as you
           can with them... and never forget that
           that's what's important.
          And Jacob L. Moore... looking his boss head on...

                          JACOB
           Andrew, if there's anyway I can help --
           give back the bonus -- whatever... all
           you have to do is say the word.
          And Zabel just looks away...

                          ZABEL
           There's just so much you don't know,
           Jacob.

          INT. KELLER, ZABEL INVESTMENTS/TRADING FLOOR - DAY

          The normally very loud and frenetic place is very quiet and
          sober today. They all watch Alexis Glick report...

           ALEXIS GLICK (ON THE TVS)
           Rumors of insolvency have hit the
           street concerning KZI's books and
           they're shooting first then asking
           questions later. The stock is now
           trading just a bit over thirty one
           dollars a share, down almost forty
           four percent on the session.
          And standing in the center of the floor, watching this...

                         JACOB
          Stunned... horrified... his universe becoming unglued.
          And he turns to Audry... helpless and in shock.

                          JACOB
           Who did this to us?
          She can only shrug... tears in her eyes.
          Jacob shifts his gaze over to the trading floor's electronic
          ticker on the wall... KZI $26.34... -$29.57.
          And he moves for the elevator banks... unable to take it
          anymore.

          EXT. MIDTOWN -DAY

          Furious, Jacob walks down 6th ave with his phone to his ear.

           16.

                         

                         

                          JACOB
           Andrew, call me back. I'm going to
           find out who did this to us. I swear
           to God... if it's the last thing I do.

                          (BEAT)
           We're going to bounce back from this.
           And we're going to find out who spread
           the rumor... and then we're going to
           destroy them.
          He disconnects the call and keeps walking.
          After a beat, with his anger brewing... Jacob SLAMS his phone
          down on the ground and it shatters.

          INT. JACOB'S APARTMENT - DAY

          Jacob lays on his couch vacantly pondering the ceiling.
          Fox Business plays on the new plasma tv on the wall...
          footage of THE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK, a tough looking man in
          his 40s, speaking to the press outside of The State Capitol.

                          GOVERNOR (FOOTAGE)
           I don't know anything about the
           solvency of Keller Zabel. I do know
           that what's bringing down the stock at
           this precise moment are rumors. And
           this practice of short selling
           American financial institutions then
           floating rumors in order to profit
           from them must be stopped. The uptick
           rule must be reinstated.
          Jacob glares over to the tv.

           GOVERNOR (FOOTAGE) (CONT'D)
           And once again, I will point to
           largely unregulated world of hedge
           funds... an ever-growing and
           increasing powerful area of the market
           that I repeatedly tried to regulate as
           Chairman of the SEC...
          And there's a loud knock on the door. Jacob ignores it.

           GOVERNOR (FOOTAGE) (CONT'D)
           And the collapse of this legendary New
           York financial institution is why I
           continue to fight that battle as
           Governor of this great state.
          Another knock... this time louder. Jacob mutes the tv.

                          JACOB
           What?
          From the door...

           17.

                         

                         

                          ROBBY

                          (SHOUTING)
           Jacob... answer the door.
          Jacob gets up, moves slowly and answers the door.

                          ROBBY (CONT'D)
           You weren't answering your phone.

                          JACOB
           It broke.
          Robby sharply nods.

                          ROBBY
           Dude...
          He stops short... swallows...

                          JACOB
           What?

                          ROBBY
           I just found this out and it hasn't
           hit the press yet.
          Once again... he stops short and looks away in frustration.

                          JACOB
           What? Robby, what are you trying to
           say?

                          ROBBY
           Andrew Zabel threw himself in front of
           the subway this morning.
          Jacob just stands in that doorway. No reaction at all.
          Absolutely frozen.

          INT. JACOB'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

          Jacob now stands in the center of his apartment. Completely
          in shock. As he looks to the plasma... Fox Business on mute.
          Brian Sullivan reporting under the graphic KZI $19.34... -

          $37.28.
          He glares at it for a long moment, then... almost calmly
          picks up a chair and throws it into the tv... which shatters.
          And Jacob... not sure what to do. Until... he turns and
          sees... on the dresser... a gorgeous engagement ring sitting
          in an open box... a fuck you ring.

          EXT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY/CAMPUS - DAY

          As Jacob bounds the steps of the Business School and heads
          into the old stone building.

           18.

                         

                         

          INT. COLUMBIA SCHOOL OF BUSINESS/URIS LECTURE HALL - DAY

          The lecture hall is packed with wall to wall students. Jacob
          stands at the back.
          A PROFESSOR is at the podium.

                          PROFESSOR
           Our speaker today has quite a
           checkered background in the world of
           finance.
          Some laughter from the room.

                          PROFESSOR (CONT'D)
           He graduated from City College in 1966
           and became a securities broker at
           Hudson River Bank then moved on to
           Smith Barney. In 1973 he went out on
           his own to establish a spectacular
           career as a independent trader then an
           active participant in the LBO craze of
           the 1980s.

                          (BEAT)
           In 1988, he was indicted for insider
           trading and then charged with other
           various forms of securities fraud and
           IRS violations. In one of the most
           harshest sentences ever given to a
           white collar criminal... he served
           fourteen years in a maximum security
           prison and he wants me to stress that
           it was not a country club.
          Again laughter from the floor.

                          PROFESSOR (CONT'D)
           Since his release in 2002, he has
           written and has spoken publicly about
           what he refers to as the current state
           of the world economy. He is not
           allowed to trade on the US exchanges.
           His new book "Moral Hazard! Why Wall
           Street Has Finally Gone Too Far."
           comes out in October.

                          (BEAT)
           Please welcome... Gordon Gekko!
          The room applauds... and out to the podium slowly walks...

                         GORDON GEKKO
          No swagger in his step... not in a suit... hair not slicked
          back... but still looks fucking good.
          As he waits for the applause to wind down... and even a
          little longer... surveying every corner of the large room...
          commanding its full attention... getting it... holding the
          silence... until finally... he leans into the mic and says...

           19.

                         

                         

                          GORDON GEKKO
           You're all pretty much fucked.
          The room breaks into laughter... Gordon smiles and waits for
          it to die down.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           What's not funny is what's happening
           out there. I don't think people get
           it. And I know the financial center
           of the world doesn't get it... which
           happens to be Washington DC now.
          As he takes to a pace...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           To understand where we are, we need to
           understand how we got here. No good
           deed goes unpunished, all fires start
           with a well meaning spark and we
           wanted Americans to be able to afford
           homes. Sounds nice enough... lets try
           to get the middle and lower classes
           into homes they can own. So we made
           money cheap and lowered restrictions
           on mortgage lending.
          As he takes a moment and looks over the room...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           Somebody reminded me the other night
           that I once said "greed is good." I
           swear I don't remember it but it
           sounds like something I would say in
           the Eighties.

                          (BEAT)
           And I was right then. Greed was good.
           America needed greed and risk-taking
           and leverage to get to become the
           superpower we are... or were. And
           capitalism needed greed and risk and
           leverage to become the economic
           platform it has become... but those
           same attributes that got us there are
           now the liabilities that threaten to
           destroy us.
          Jacob's blackberry vibrates and he checks it. He has a text.
          "KZI!!! -- wtf?"

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           So greed has been redefined. Who
           knows -- maybe it was always like this
           and like everything else in this
           world, it's good and it is evil.
          Taking a moment to survey the room...

           20.

                         

                         

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           Because people -- it's greed that
           caused someone who aspires to own a
           seven-hundred thousand dollar house
           they can't afford, to take on a loan
           they'll never be able to pay back...
           and it's greed that caused their
           mortgage lender to give them that loan
           then sell it right away... and it's
           greed that caused the buyer of that
           loan to slice it into a million little
           pieces then spit them all over the
           world... and it's greed that caused
           the rating agency to give that toxic
           loan a triple-A rating just because it
           was mixed in with some good loans...
           and it's greed that caused the
           insurance company to insure that loan.
          Jacob quickly glances down again at his blackberry and checks
          the quote, KZI $14.53.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           They were insuring the end of the
           world; "When the world explodes...
           just find us in the rubble and we'll
           be sure to pay your claim."
          Drawing in a deep breath...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           CMO's, CLO's, CBO's, CDO's, CDS's,
           SPE's, ABCP's,SIV's, REMIC's, CMBS's,
           toxic traunches, ninja loans, credit
           default swaps, affinity marketing,
           stapled financing, synthetic
           securitization.

                          (BEAT)
           Maybe I was in prison too long but I
           have no idea what half that shit
           means.
          The room laughs in agreement.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           And I'm considered a pretty smart guy
           when it comes to finance!
          And Jacob's blackberry vibrates again. This time he removes
          it from his pocket, doesn't check it and simply turns it off.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           And if I know our central bank --
           which I do -- I predict it's going to
           throw gasoline on this fire with more
           cheap money and federal bailouts and

                          HEAD-IN-THE-SAND MANIPULATED
           statistics on productivity and
           inflation.
          And Gordon stops pacing... takes a moment for effect.

           21.

                         

                         
          Then sums it all up with...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           So no good deed goes unpunished and
           all fires start with a well-meaning
           spark and when you take free money and
           no lending standards then add it with
           unaccountable risk and ungodly
           leverage and unbridled greed... what
           you end up with is cancer.
          And Gordon takes in a deep breath...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           Systemic, malignant and global.
          Now the room is completely silent.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           Do they still have the V&T restaurant
           on Amsterdam? Is that still there?
          A stunned girl in the front row shakes her head.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           (with a smile)
           God, I loved their pizza.

          INT. URIS HALLWAY - DAY

          Jacob looks on as Gordon is surrounded by professors and
          students alike...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           (announcing to the throng)
           I'll give you six minutes then I
           really have to go.

          EXT. URIS HALL - EXACTLY 6 MINUTES LATER

          Gordon quickly walks out with his PUBLISHER, a woman in her
          40s and heads into the quad. Jacob immediately matches their
          stride.

                          JACOB
           Mr. Gekko, can I speak to you for a
           moment?
          As he keeps walking...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           You're too late, Sport... Q&A's over.

                          JACOB
           My name is Jacob Moore and I'm dating
           your daughter.

                          (AND THEN)
           I'm going to ask her to marry me.
          And this makes Gordon stop and finally face Jacob with...

           22.

                         

                         

                          GORDON GEKKO
           I'll give you nine minutes.

          EXT. 112TH STREET - MOMENTS LATER

          As Gordon and Jacob leave the campus and take to the street.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Keller, Zabel? Then you have my
           apologies.

                          JACOB
           Yeah...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Stock's in a free fall. My guess is
           that it just lost its Bar Mitzvah...
          Jacob quickly takes out his blackberry, turns it on and
          checks to see Gordon's right... KZI... $12.54.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           By the end of the day it might not
           even be potty trained.
          And Jacob looks at him.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           I might not be allowed to trade, Jake,
           but I still love to watch from home.

                          JACOB
           Andrew Zabel took me under his wing
           when I was in high school. He
           basically got me my scholarship to
           Yale then hired me right out of
           business school.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Andrew's smart, he beats the
           benchmarks consistently. He'll land
           on his feet.

                          JACOB
           He's dead.
          And Gordon stops walking and regards Jacob. Who confirms...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           He killed himself this morning.
          As that registers...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           I'm sorry to hear that.

                          JACOB
           He was a father to me.

           23.

                         

                         
          And Jacob coldly shakes it off then sucks in a deep breath
          and looks into Gordon's eyes... genuine and lofty...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           I love your daughter very much and I
           would be honored if...
          And realizing what this is... Gordon starts to laugh... which
          throws Jacob off.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           ... you would bless-- I really don't
           understand what you find so funny.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           My daughter hasn't spoken to me for
           eleven years and you know it. She
           blames me for her brother's overdose
           and every other disaster that's fallen
           upon the world since the mid-nineties.

                          (BEAT)
           And by the way, isn't it strange that
           Winnie would date a guy from the
           street?

                          JACOB
           What?

                          GORDON GEKKO
           She hates me. And she hates Wall
           Street and everything it represents...
           so don't you find it curious that she
           would fall in love with you?
          And that slams into Jacob... who's frozen for a beat.
          Jacob finally snaps out of it then joins Gordon.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           So you want my blessing?

                          JACOB
           Yes.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           I guess I should know a little about
           you first. Where did you grow up?

                          JACOB
           Matinecock.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           I'm impressed.

                          JACOB
           It wasn't like that. I mean we didn't
           have much money. My mother was a
           tailor.

           24.

                         

                         

                          GORDON GEKKO
           And your father... what did he do?

                          JACOB
           Disappear.
          And Gordon regards Jacob for a long moment, taking him in,
          until...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Clever.
          Jacob looks down the street.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           What are you looking for?

                          JACOB
           Your town car.
          With a laugh...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Well, pal...
          As Gordon pats Jacob on the back...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           ... then you're going to be looking
           for quite awhile.
          ... and heads for the subway.

          INT. 110TH STREET SUBWAY STATION - DAY

          Gordon takes out his wallet and produces his metrocard.
          Jacob notices a picture of Winnie in the wallet.

                          JACOB

                          (RE PICTURE)
           Can I see that?
          Gordon shrugs and shows the picture to Jacob.
          It's of a young Winnie and younger Gordon on the back of a
          gorgeous white horse.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           She was eight in that one. It was
           taken in Egypt.

                          JACOB
           Can I... have it?

                          (EXPLAINING)
           She doesn't keep pictures from her
           childhood.
          Gordon slowly nods.

           25.

                         

                         

                          GORDON GEKKO
           What do I get in return?

                          JACOB
           You... wanna make a trade?
          And Gordon thinks about, then...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Yes. I'll give you this picture and
           in return... I'd like a picture of
           Winnie... taken recently... without
           you in it.

                          JACOB
           I don't have one on me.
          Gordon sighs, takes the picture out of his wallet and hands
          it to Jacob.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Then I'll give you this one on margin.

                         PLATFORM
          As they wait for the train...
          Jacob produces the ring box and opens it to show Gordon the
          ring.

                          JACOB
           I really did come to ask for your
           blessing.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           No, you didn't. Nice ring...
          As the train arrives...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           It's so typical.
           (inside of an ironic laugh)
           Levered to the hilt... and with the
           ship going down...
          As he gets on...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           ... they still gave you a bonus.

          INT. THE DOWNTOWN 3 TRAIN - DAY

          Gordon stares at a one sheet advertisement on the wall.
          And he doesn't look at Jacob when he says...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Don't play me, Jake. You don't think
           I can see it in your eyes? You don't
           think I know that look?

                          (BEAT)

                          (MORE)

           26.

                         

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           I know it by sight, Kid... because I
           lived it for years. Christ, I can
           even smell it on you.

                          JACOB
           Smell what on me?

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Revenge.
          Jacob just looks away.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           Some hedgehog said bad things about
           your company. It caused the stock to
           plummet and made those bad things
           become true.
          And Jacob now sees the poster that has Gordon's attention.
          It features a pile of money being blown out the window under
          the caption that reads... "If this looks familiar to you...
          it's because you're renting!"

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           The man you loved like a father threw
           himself in front of the uptown five
           this morning and you want to bring
           that hedgehog to their knees.

                          JACOB
           You knew he was dead?
          "Guardian Mortgage... Low down payments... Adjustable rates."

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Like I said -- I still love to watch
           from home.
          And now Gordon turns to face Jacob with...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           So don't insult me by pretending to
           ask for Winnifred's hand when what you
           really want to know is who to bring
           down to their knees and how to do it.
          And Jacob swallows that back... doesn't argue it.

                          JACOB
           I know who.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Really?

                          JACOB
           It was either Nassim Tariq from the
           Frontier Fund, Bretton Woods from
           Locust or Karen Molina from ESL.

           27.

                         

                         

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Does Winnie even know you came to see
           me?

                          JACOB
           Well, not exactly.

                          (THEN)
           But I'm going to tell her.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Not such a grand idea, Pal.
          Off Jacob's confusion...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           See, I have a feeling you're going to
           want to see me again. And if you tell
           her we had this little pow-wow...
           she's not going to let that happen.
          As Jacob considers that... the train slows to a stop.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           Look, you seem like a smart kid.

                          (BEAT)
           Walk away, dust off your resume and
           get another job...
          As he steals one last glance at that Guardian Mortgage ad...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           ... but do it quick.
          And with that, Gordon moves for the doors.
          But Jacob steps in front of him.

                          JACOB
           I'm going to bring them down. Whoever
           floated the rumor for a quick buck.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           It's not worth it. It's a waste of
           energy and time. See, Jacob, nobody
           gets it... they never did.
          As the subway doors open...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           If there's one thing I learned in
           prison it's that money is not the
           prime commodity in our lives... time
           is.

                          (BEAT)
           And your nine minutes are up.
          And Gordon Gekko gets off the subway... leaving Jacob on the
          train. But right before the doors close, Gordon stops and
          turns with...

           28.

                         

                         

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           There are worse ways to go than
           jumping in front of a train. For
           instance, could you imagine taking
           something for your diabetes...
          As the doors close...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           .. and end up having it cause you to
           die of acute pancreatitis?
          And as the subway pulls out of the station, Jacob Moore just
          stands there... holding the pole and wondering what the hell
          that was supposed to mean.

          EXT. ANDREW ZABEL'S MATINECOCK, LONG ISLAND HOME - DAY

          A Victorian Estate on a bluff. Zabel's funeral in progress.
          Hundreds of people made it out from the city. All types.

                          PRIEST
           Andrew didn't have children, so he
           made all you -- all of us -- his
           children.

                          (BEAT)
           And to list Andrew Zabel's many
           accomplishments would take me far too
           long to enumerate, but if you just
           look around you, you'll see those
           accomplishments in the faces of the
           many people gathered here today.
          And we pan the procession of mourners... past...

                          PRIEST (CONT'D)
           The alumni of the Morris High School
           class of 1997... who -- through the
           adopt a grade program -- Andrew
           pledged to pay the college educations
           of every member who graduated and got
           accepted into a University.
          ... past...

                          PRIEST (CONT'D)
           The members of the Saint Helena
           Symphony, who Andrew provided

           facing extinction.

                          (BEAT)
           And the many, many, other recipients
           of Andrew Zabel's generosity.
          ... and past...

                          PRIEST (CONT'D)
           Those who were left behind... those

           29.

                         

                         
          And we land on Jacob L. Moore...

           PRIEST (CONT'D)(O.S)
           Above being just a great financial

          He wears a dark suit... and a blank expression...

           ... or a great father... or a great

           PRIEST (CONT'D) (O.S.)
           ... Andrew Zabel was a great man.

          INT. POOL HOUSE - DAY

          Most of the guests across the pool eat and quietly mill about.
          We're with Jacob, Willy, Audry and another trader named

          DANIEL.

                          AUDRY
           Two dollars a share?

                          WILLY
           The Fed didn't give us a choice.
          Jacob walks around the room... taking in the pictures of
          Andrew Zabel's life...

                          AUDRY
           Does that include the building?

                          DANIEL
           What about the Zabel's institutional
           managed fund? How much is in that?

                          WILLY
           Eight billion.

                          AUDRY
           And that's all intact.

                          DANIEL
           Jesus, United Bancorp made out like a
           bandit.

                          WILLY
           We could've handled it at $60 a share
           or even $50.
          He just shakes his head...

                          WILLY (CONT'D)
           It was that fucking rumor. It was so
           well timed. And the market doesn't
           care... shoot first, ask later.

           30.

                         

                         

                          DANIEL
           Lemmings.

                          AUDRY

                          (OMINOUSLY)
           United has a huge trading desk.

                          DANIEL
           Yeah, we're all out of a job.
          Jacob pulls away from the wall of pictures...

                          JACOB
           My mother was a tailor.
          They all look at him.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           Out of our house less than five miles
           from here.

                          AUDRY
           You're from Matinecock? I thought you
           didn't grow up with mon--
          Jacob confirms...

                          JACOB
           We weren't rich. Everyone else was.

                          (BEAT)
           She altered their clothes and I
           carried their golf clubs.
          And Jacob looks at a picture of Andrew Zabel one more time...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           He gave me a seat at the table.
          ... and goes.

          EXT. ANDREW ZABEL'S HOME - DAY

          Jacob heads for the main house. He sees BARBARA ZABEL,
          Andrew's wife, sitting next to the some friends.
          Jacob slowly walks over and when she sees him... she
          stands... wobbly and full of tears.

                          BARBARA
           Jacob...
          Jacob takes her into his embrace...

                          BARBARA (CONT'D)
           (through her sobs)
           You were a son to him...
          Squeezing her tight... fighting back a rush of emotion.

           31.

                         

                         

                          JACOB
           I was a fucked up kid, I was angry, my
           mother couldn't control me. He was
           the only one who cared. I wouldn't be
           anywhere right now if it wasn't for...
          And Jacob Moore stops short... finally breaking down...
          allowing his own tears to stream down his face.
          He pulls away...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           If you need anything.
          She nods.
          And Jacob moves away from the people and moves across the
          lawn. But he stops when he sees a woman standing across the
          way... we've seen pictures of her.
          She's in her late-twenties with a natural beauty that might
          take two glances to notice. But after that second glance...
          it's unforgettable. She's WINNIE GEKKO.
          As she rushes to him...

                          WINNIE
           Jacob, I'm so sorry.

                          (BEAT)
           Why didn't you tell me?

                          JACOB
           Lehigh had the committee hearings and
           I knew he would need you and I didn't

                          WANT TO--

                          WINNIE
           That's not how this works.
          And she looks into his eyes.

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)
           Jacob, that's not how this works.
          He nods. Regards her for a beat, then...

                          JACOB
           Will you marry me?

                          WINNIE
           What?

                          JACOB
           I got a ring. Not on me, but--

                          WINNIE
           Are you proposing to me at a funeral?

                          JACOB
           Yeah.

           32.

                         

                         
          And then...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           I had a whole thing I was going to do
           in DC but seeing you... the words just
           kind of fell out of my mouth... I
           don't know.

                          WINNIE
           He would've loved you doing this here.
          Jacob agrees. And she softly kisses him and squeezes him
          tight... tears in her eyes.

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)
           Yes... I'll marry you, Jacob.
          Hugging her back.

                          JACOB
           By the way, I don't have a job
           anymore.

                          WINNIE
           Awesome.

          AND THAT FUCK YOU RING
          Glittering in all its glory. Pull back to be in...

                         JACOB'S APARTMENT
          Winnie looks up from the ring.

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)
           It's beautiful.

                          JACOB
           Yeah...

                          WINNIE
           It's too expensive. We'll return it.

                          JACOB
           No.

                          WINNIE
           Jacob I don't care about what ring you
           give me. You know that.

                          JACOB
           We're not taking it back. I worked
           hard for that ring and I want you to
           wear it.
          She regards him... he's serious.

                          WINNIE
           Okay.

           33.

                         

                         
          He moves to her... takes the ring and places it on her
          finger.
          Then Jacob pulls her into his kiss... it's almost violent.
          She's taken off guard.
          And as they fall into each other then back onto the bed...

          INT. KELLER, ZABEL INVESTMENTS/TRADING FLOOR - DAY

          The whole floor is dead. The tvs are off.
          Jacob cleans out his desk, Audry cleans hers out as well
          across the way.
          Jacob wipes his forehead and glances up at the large letters
          on the wall "Keller, Zabel Investments."
          And he shakes his head in anger and frustration...

                          JACOB
           Hey Audry.
          She looks up.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           You cover pharm and biotech.

                          AUDRY
           I did.

                          JACOB
           Who are the big players in diabetes
           treatments?

                          AUDRY
           Lilly, Abbot, OSI, Inverness.

                          JACOB
           Is anyone riding on something in phase
           three?

                          AUDRY
           Few midcaps maybe. You want me to
           check?
          He nods. She turns on her computer and takes a seat.

                          AUDRY (CONT'D)
           Oh, this takes me back to when I had a
           job...
          He stands over her shoulder.

                          AUDRY (CONT'D)
           Yeah, Amlyn pharmaceuticals has Byetta
           going in front of the FDA next month.
           I remember this...

           34.

                         

                          AUDRY (CONT'D)
           they pulled it during phase two
           because some of the test subjects died
           but they've obviously solved those
           problems now.

                          JACOB
           How did they die?

                          AUDRY
           I don't remember.

                          JACOB
           Pancreatitis?

                          AUDRY
           Yeah. That was it.
          Jacob shakes his head...

                          JACOB
           How did he know?

                          AUDRY
           Who?
          Without answering her...

                          JACOB
           Can you look up large institutional
           ownership?

                          AUDRY
           Mutual or hedge?

                          JACOB
           Hedge.

                          AUDRY
           Locust Fund owns a shitload.
          And she looks over to Jacob with...

                          AUDRY (CONT'D)
           Bretton Woods.
          As he takes in that information...

                          JACOB
           Want your severance, Audry?
          And he kisses her on the forehead...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           Short Amlyn pharmaceuticals.
          ... and goes.

           Your boy's coming up in the polls.
          Senator Lehigh nods.

                          SENATOR LEHIGH
           They're blaming this mess on the
           current administration... it's helping
           us. And some people say that the
           worst isn't over.

                          JACOB
           Her father. What's the word he
           uses... systemic.
          Winnie looks over to Jacob.

                          WINNIE
           When did he say that?
          And Jacob takes for an extra long moment... holding her

                          JACOB
           I'm here to see Bretton Woods.
          The butler nods then leads Jacob through the full floor unit
          and into the...

                         PARLOR

           40.

                         

                         
          A huge chandelier hangs over the all marble room. A
          fireplace on one wall and a twelve foot wall of glass
          featuring that park view on the other.
          And Jacob realizes that sonata is live. He's walked into a
          recital of some sort.
          About twenty people sit watching a YOUNG GIRL play on a very
          unique looking silver grand piano.
          The girl can't be a day over thirteen. She's playing
          Mozart's "Ronda Alla Turca"... her fingers gliding across the
          keyboard in precision, her eyes closed in inspiration. It's
          as spectacular as it is moving.
          Jacob takes it in for a moment then looks over the room. All
          ethnicities and types...
          The AFRICAN LEADER in full tribal gear, the DISHEVELED ARTIST
          with his GAY NOVELIST LOVER, the NEW YORK KNICK with his
          MODEL WIFE, the MOVIE STAR with her TEENAGE SON.
          And BRETTON WOODS...
          Mid 40s, slicing jawline, deep set eyes, in great shape,
          refined, composed and masculine.
          He's the owner of this penthouse and he's looking right at
          Jacob. Jacob looks away.
          And the young girl finishes the last movement of the sonata
          to applause.
          The guests all stand, some go talk with the girl. Bretton
          heads over to Jacob.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           As you can see, I'm having a little
           dinner party here but I thought it was
           important we speak right away.
          He speaks with a British accent.. Jacob nods.
          Bretton looks over the room for a moment, scans his guests
          then back at Jacob...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           Please... if you don't mind waiting in
           my office, I'll be in a minute.
          And the butler is already at Jacob's side, motioning him to
          follow him.

          INT. BRETTON WOODS'S OFFICE - NIGHT

          Jacob waits for Bretton. He looks over the place. The view
          of the park. The classic furniture.

          AND THE HUGE PAINTING ON THE WALL

           41.

                         

                         
          Of a giant man-like monster eating a much smaller naked
          human. The smaller man's head's been bitten off and blood
          drips down the body.
          Jacob holds on the painting.

           BRETTON WOODS (O.S.)
           Saturno devorando a sus hijos.
          As Jacob turns to see Bretton standing in the doorway.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           Saturn devouring his son. Francisco
           Goya.
          Bretton heads in and closes the door behind him.

                          JACOB
           Do you collect?

                          BRETTON WOODS
           No.
          Sitting behind his desk...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           Only the obsessive compulsive or the
           insecure egotistical feel the need to
           collect things.
          Jacob nods. Bretton just looks at him... making him nervous.

                          JACOB
           Your daughter's an amazing piano
           player. That was quite a show.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           That wasn't my daughter. That was
           Isabel Patrovsky, she's the world's
           greatest living piano prodigy.

                          (BEAT)
           And that wasn't a show... that was a
           very expensive private recital.
          There's a long beat of silence with Jacob just looking at
          Bretton... taking him in.
          And it's unmistakable -- the one thing that this man exudes
          above all else... is composure.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           You cost my fund three hundred and
           forty million dollars today.
          Off of Jacob's slight smile...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           Yeah, kills my year, pushes my
           watermark higher and might cause
           redemptions.

                          (MORE)

           42.

                         

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

                          (BEAT)
           I hope you're happy. My fund's in
           trouble now.
          Jacob just shrugs.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           You don't want to deny it?

                          JACOB
           No.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Who told you?

                          JACOB
           A doctor I know.
          Bretton nods... regards him.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           I checked with all the desks in
           town... you didn't make money off it.

                          JACOB
           That's right.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Then why did you do it?

                          JACOB
           You destroyed my firm.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Your firm destroyed itself.

                          JACOB
           You killed Andrew Zabel.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Andrew Zabel killed himself.
          And Bretton sighs...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           The rumors were true.

                          JACOB
           You made them true.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           No, Jacob, being levered thirty-eight
           to one in toxic debt made them true.

                          (BEAT)
           Institutional money-running was
           Zabel's talent... he didn't have a
           down year in the last twenty.
          Jacob just glares at him.

           43.

                         

                         

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           His fatal flaw was allowing the
           children on his mortgage security desk
           to talk him into the deadly game of
           hot potato everybody's been so fond of
           playing recently.
          And Jacob holds Bretton's look for a moment, then... heads
          for the door without saying a thing...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           Come work for me.
          Jacob stops and turns...

                          JACOB
           What?

                          BRETTON WOODS
           I run three billion dollars. Come
           help me run it.
          And Jacob takes a beat... processing this...

                          JACOB
           Why me?

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Because your loyalty desired revenge,
           your balls actually attempted it and
           your skills pulled it off.
          As he stands...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           And as for Andrew Zabel... there
           really is no telling why he did what
           he did.

                          (BEAT)
           As far as I'm concerned, it was just a
           bit of money... and there are surely
           more important things in the world.
          And Jacob sucks in a deep breath -- containing his anger.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           Now I'm going on Safari with my
           family. Think about the offer and get
           in touch after the July 4th holiday.
          ... heading for the door...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           You got my attention, Jacob... and
           that's one of the rarest commodities
           out there.
          And Jacob just regards him, then...

           44.

                         

                         

                          JACOB
           You can have my answer now, Bretton...
           I have no interest in working for a
           fund that's in trouble.
          Bretton smiles...

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Touche.
          Jacob nods... holding Bretton's look. Then...

                          JACOB
           What's your number?

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Excuse me?

                          JACOB
           The amount of money you would need to
           be able to walk away from it all and
           just live happily-ever-after.

                          (BEAT)
           Everybody has one -- it's an exact
           number -- what's yours?
          And Bretton takes a moment to think about that, then simply
          says...

                          BRETTON WOODS
           More.
          ... and disappears into his penthouse.

          EXT. 533 THIRD AVENUE - MORNING

          Jacob heads out of his building to be greeted by...

                          DIEGO
           You know what I overheard a guy say
           yesterday?

                          JACOB
           I know you're going to tell me...
          Diego smiles...

                          DIEGO
           "This market's just like a divorce.
           I've lost half my money... only I
           still have my wife!"
          As he goes into the hot summer day...

                          JACOB
           Not bad...

           45.

                         

                         

          EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE/ATLANTIC GRILL - DAY

          Jacob heads up to the restaurant to find Gordon Gekko waiting
          outside.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           There's a wait.

                          JACOB
           Oh...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Fifteen minutes she said.

                          JACOB
           Okay.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           No, that's not okay. Because it means
           they're crowded so every tier in the
           service chain will be extended. The
           sixteen minutes we would normally wait
           to order will now be twenty six, the
           standard twenty four minutes waiting
           for our food to arrive will turn into
           thirty nine, the eight minutes to get
           the check will become seventeen and
           the four minutes to process the credit
           card will take nine.

                          (BEAT)
           I told you I'd have lunch with you...
           not give you a hundred and six minutes
           of my time.
          Jacob just stands there.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           Let's go to Whole Foods.

          INT. WHOLE FOODS - DAY

          Gordon and Jacob share a little table out front of the market.
          Gordon enjoys a turkey burger from the deli while Jacob doesn't
          eat.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Did you eat before?

                          JACOB
           Just not hungry.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Yeah... I used to not eat lunch too.
          Jacob nods and slides something across the table. The
          picture of Winnie in workout gear, flipping the finger.
          Gordon looks at it and laughs.

           46.

                         

                         

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           Fitting.
          As he places it in his pocket...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           That'll make it a round trade for us.

                          JACOB
           I actually owe you one now.
          Off Gordon's look...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           I crushed him.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Did you?

                          JACOB
           His fund is bleeding. I wouldn't be
           surprised if the redemptions finish
           the job.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Well, Chief... you seem awfully proud
           of yourself.

                          JACOB
           How'd you know about Amlyn?
          Gordon shrugs.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           It's amazing what information you can
           find out when people know you're not
           going to trade on it.

                          JACOB
           So, you didn't use me to make a little
           money?
          And never to look up from his lunch...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Naw. I prefer to write about the
           action now than be apart of it.

                          JACOB
           Why'd you give it to me?

                          GORDON GEKKO
           You're out of a job and most likely
           going to marry my daughter... I
           figured you could use the money.

                          JACOB
           I didn't make any money off of it.

           47.

                         

                         

                          GORDON GEKKO
           You didn't trade it?
          With a smile in and over-the-top faux innocence.

                          JACOB
           That would've been insider trading,
           Mr. Gekko.
          Gordon just shakes his head.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           And not "most likely."

                          (BEAT)
           Winnie and I are engaged.
          As Gordon finally looks up from his burger... impressed.

          EXT. PARK AVENUE - DAY

          As they walk up Park Avenue...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           So did you take my advice and not tell
           your new fiance about our little
           friendship.
          Jacob doesn't say anything. And Gordon doesn't press.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           So, I'm guessing she's not going to
           take your last name.

                          JACOB
           Good guess.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           That's my Winnie. I knew she was a
           feminist when she was five and furious
           that Mrs. Claus didn't get enough
           credit.
          And this makes Jacob smile... then...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           My brother has two daughters. I had
           Winnie and Rudy.
           (sucking in a deep breath)
           And since Rudy... you know... well,
           I've worried about the name. It's
           something you don't really think about
           until you hit sixty or so but it's
           important.
          As they walk some more in silence, until...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           I want you to get my daughter to
           accept me back into her life again,
           Jacob.

           48.

                         

                         
          Jacob slowly nods... not surprised.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           Because save for the extremely
           precious and depreciating asset of
           time... she's all I have.
          As Gordon stops in front of a Georgian-style, pre-war
          building and turns to Jacob...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           C'mon, I'll show you some more
           pictures of your fiancee that she
           doesn't want you to see.

          INT. 655 PARK AVENUE/ELEVATOR - DAY

          Gordon and Jacob get into the elevator, Gordon pushes "4."
          The doors begin to close but someone gets on at the last
          moment.
          He's a hedge fund type, real SLICK, reminds us of Gekko
          twenty years ago. Oh... and he's about 29 years old.

                          SLICK
           Gordon...
          Gekko nods. Slick hits his floor... "PH."

                          SLICK (CONT'D)
           Sky still falling?

                          GORDON GEKKO
           You know it.

                          SLICK
           (inside of a derisive sigh)
           Sells books I guess.

          INT. GEKKO'S APARTMENT/LIVING ROOM - DAY

          No doubt about it, this is a nice place. Worth three million
          dollars, maybe four at the beginning of the year.
          Sparsely decorated. Large framed photographs line the walls.
          Gordon shows Jacob pictures of Winnie's childhood.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           She refused to take that cowboy hat
           off. She actually slept in it.
          Smitten, Jacob looks at some more of the pictures then
          stands... taking in the large framed pictures on the wall.
          As Jacob checks out a framed chart for "Gouda Tulip Bulbs Dec
          1 1634 to Feb 5 1637." The chart goes straight up and to the
          right then straight down in a single line.

           49.

                         

                         

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           Tulip mania... the art of a bubble.

                          JACOB
           Bretton offered to hire me.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           And did you accept?
          As Jacob moves over to an another piece.

                          JACOB
           Fuck no.
          Jacob now finds himself looking at a political cartoon from
          the early 1900s.
          It's of two men rowing a boat in a lake of dollars. One of
          the men is Uncle Sam dressed in US flag colors. But Sam's
          very small in this cartoon... can't really row the boat.
          The other man is much bigger and clearly doing the heavy
          rowing. He is...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           JP Morgan... he single-handedly
           stopped the Panic of 1907 by stepping
           in and buying up shares in all the
           companies that were crashing.
           Everyone else quickly followed like
           lemmings.
           (re political cartoon)
           See -- people had stopped looking to
           their government or trusted advisors.
           They looked to JP Morgan. It was all
           about simple psychology -- every crash
           should have a JP Morgan to step in and
           save it.
          As they walk the hardwood floor...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           See Jacob... the best opportunities
           are found where angels fear to tread.
          And they arrive at the next piece on the wall... a small
          framed bond.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           That's a bond issued by the Central
           American country of Poyais. Gregor
           McGregor made a fortune dealing these
           to the British elite in 1820.

                          (BEAT)
           The country didn't exist.
          And now Jacob notices a very strange picture across the
          room... he goes over to look at it.

           50.

                         

                         
          It's very old... black and white... of a woman filling her
          stove with money.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           Weimer Republic of Germany 1922.
           Inflation turned to hyper-inflation
           and it was more efficient to burn the
           money for heat than spend it.

                          JACOB
           That's horrifying.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           I know.
          As they both hold on the picture...

                          JACOB
           What caused it?

                          GORDON GEKKO
           A country in debt... that took on even
           more debt to fund a war... then
           printed mountains of money to avoid a
           depression and other financial
           imbalances...
          As he turns to face Jacob...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           ... sound familiar?

                          JACOB
           And you honestly think this is where
           we're heading?
          Looking Jacob head on... deadly serious...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           If we don't take our heads out of the
           sand... yes. It's going to get bad
           out there, Champ, I'm not going to
           lie. Even the small regional bank I
           started out at might go under.

                          JACOB
           Hudson River Bank...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           That's right.
          And then...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           And I've got some news for you... he
           ain't bleeding. He's not even cut.

                          JACOB
           What are you talking about?

           51.

                         

                         

                          GORDON GEKKO
           What I'm talking about, Jake... is
           that I'd bet dollars to donuts that
           Bretton Woods unwound most of his
           position in Amlyn last week. That he
           knew about the pancreatitis.
          Off of Jacob's confusion...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           The only reason you think you hurt him
           is because he wanted you to think
           that.

                          JACOB
           How do you know that?

                          GORDON GEKKO
           I don't. But it's not Bretton's first
           rodeo... and my instincts for this
           sort of thing don't often disappoint.
          Jacob can't believe it. And with each passing moment of
          realization... shock turns into rage.

                          JACOB
           I can't believe it.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Believe it, Princess... he's beating
           your ass all over the court.
          As Jacob tries to calm himself.

                          JACOB
           And you think I should take the job --
           bring him down from the inside?
          Gordon confirms that with a simple shake of the head and...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           I don't know, Jake... what you kids
           think is pay-back these days is really
           incredible. When I was coming up, we
           slaughtered men.

                          (BEAT)
           There are guys still working at penny
           ante brokerages in the Poughkeepsie's
           of this country because they crossed
           me.
          While Jacob processes that...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           So I'll make you another trade, Jake.
           I'll help you bring him down, if you
           help me get her back.
          As Jacob just looks away... non committal.

           52.

                         

                         

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           ... then you both can have a father.

          EXT. PARK AVENUE - NIGHT

          As Jacob walks... on the phone with...

                          ROBBY
           Jacob, I could lose my job.
          ... who holds his sleeping infant in his hands.

                          JACOB
           Robby, I need to know. Now nobody
           moves size in this town without using
           your desk.

                          (BEAT)
           We'll play twenty questions only it'll
           be two questions and all you have to
           do is say "yes or no."
          Capitulating with a sigh...

                          ROBBY
           Fire away...

                          JACOB
           Bretton Woods... The Locust Fund...
           did they make any major moves in the
           last few weeks?

                          ROBBY
           Yes.

                          JACOB
           Was it unloading Amlyn
           pharmaceuticals?

                          ROBBY

                          (NERVOUS)
           Jacob...

                          JACOB
           Robby, I got you the fucking the job!
          And after a long moment.

                          ROBBY
           Yes.
          Jacob stops walking... sucks in a deep breath...

                          JACOB
           I'm sorry to make you do that.
          With that, he disconnects and shakes his head in frustration.
          And after a moment, Jacob sucks in a deep breath then makes
          another call.

           53.

                         

                         

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           (into the phone)
           Okay Gordon... you've got yourself a
           trade.

          AND WERE BACK ON THE CHART
          As a circle forms on June 19th then travels down the trend
          line to early July and stops.
          And as a circle is formed around July 4th, we...

                          CUT TO:

                         FIREWORKS
          Exploding over the Capitol building.

          EXT. SENATOR LEHIGH'S GEORGETOWN HOME - NIGHT

          A BBQ for the political set and their families. Paper plates
          and plastic cups are being thrown away by HELP Children and
          parents lay on blankets watching the fireworks.
          Jacob holds Winnie as they look up at the sky...

                          WINNIE
           My parents would always throw this
           huge party in the Hamptons on the
           fourth. The city of South Hampton
           would have its firework show at 8pm
           then my father would wait until it was
           over then put on his... which, of
           course, was always twice as
           spectacular.
          She leans up, sips her wine, then...

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)
           Then one year the city passed an
           ordinance that their firework show had
           to be the last of the night... they
           were sick of getting shown up by
           Gordon Gekko.
          Jacob laughs...

                          JACOB
           What'd he do?

                          WINNIE
           He rented a barge and shot the
           fireworks off of it a mile off the
           coast... out of jurisdiction.
           (then... almost to herself)
           The show was even more amazing over
           the water.
          And Jacob looks at her.

           54.

                         

                         

                          JACOB
           I think he should be invited to the
           wedding.

                          WINNIE
           No.

                          JACOB
           Winnie, he's your father...
          As the fireworks explode into their finale...

                          WINNIE
           You don't know him.

                          JACOB
           I know he's unhappy. Look at him out
           there... trying to scare everybody.
           He's desperate for attention.

                          WINNIE
           This is none of your business.

                          JACOB
           "That's not how this works."
           Remember?
          She just looks away...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           He's got nothing.
          The firework show ends and everyone applauds...

                          WINNIE
           And that's what he deserves.
          Suddenly, everyone begins to look over to the house where
          something is happening...

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)
           The things that came out after he was
           convicted. The affairs... the things
           he was recorded saying...
          SECRET SERVICE PERSONNEL, wearing ear pieces, start walking
          the lawn.

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)
           This wasn't the man we knew, Jacob.
           It was... sociopathic.
          She stands up and looks across the lawn to where all the
          action is.

                          JACOB
           It was a long time ago.
          He stands and kisses her...

           55.

                         

                         

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           Just consider it, okay? That's all
           I'm asking.
          She holds his look for a long moment, then... nodding over to
          all the excitement...

                          WINNIE
           C'mon, you can meet the next President
           of the United States.

          INT. THE LOCUST FUND FOYER - DAY

          A massive foyer of black marble with wall to wall views of
          Manhattan. There's much more space than furniture here.
          Jacob waits patiently in a white suede chair... he checks his
          watch and sighs. He's been sitting here quite awhile.
          Finally, the SIX FOOT TALL RECEPTIONIST, leaves her desk...
          her heels clicking as she walks over.

                          SIX FOOT
           Jacob... are you ready?
          Jacob stands and she leads him toward a bank of elevators.
          The doors open and Jacob gets on.

          INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

          Jacob stands there with Six Foot.

                          SIX FOOT
           Do you have everything they said you'd
           need?
          Jacob nods... holding a folder of his previous tax forms, his
          passport and other documents obviously needed for the job.
          And the elevator doors open... but not to an office...
          Jacob shields his eyes to the wash of daylight... then looks
          to realize that he's on the roof of the building.
          And in front of him is... An Augusta A109E Helicopter with
          "The Locust Fund" written on the side.

          INT. AUGUSTA HELICOPTER - DAY

          As Jacob looks down to the city below, wondering where the
          hell they're going...

          EXT. TETERBORO AIRPORT - DAY

          Jacob emerges from the Augusta and looks across the tarmac to
          see a Boeing 727 with "The Locust Fund" written on the side.
          And now Jacob knows why he needed his passport.

           56.

                         

                         

          EXT. LONDON - NIGHT

          As the 727 dives down toward Biggin Hill airfield... the
          lights of London twinkling to the north.

          EXT. CHELSEA - NIGHT

          The Black Maybach limousine pulls up out front of a 19,000-
          square-foot Victorian home with the perfectly restored brick
          exterior.
          As Jacob gets out of the car and sizes down this incredible
          home...

          INT. BRETTON WOODS'S CHELSEA HOME/THE BLACK SWAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          The design is much different that Woods's New York CPW
          penthouse. It's more classical... with dark woods and worn
          leathers and thick rugs and commanding views along the River
          Thames.
          And Jacob is lead into the...

                         DINING ROOM
          Where Bretton eats alone at the head of the long table.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Jacob.
          As Jacob walks through the expansive space...

                          JACOB
           Mr. Woods.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           (Call me...)
           Bretton.
          ... and sits.

                          JACOB
           Okay... Bretton. I thought we were
           going to meet in New York.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           And I thought you had no interest in
           working for a fund that was in
           trouble.

                          JACOB
           I was emotional. I was angry.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           And what changed?

                          JACOB
           I caught a glance of my portfolio.

           57.

                         

                         
          And Bretton laughs.
          Jacob notices two huge chocolate brown French Mastiffs
          sitting at Bretton's feet.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           Cute dogs.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Dogue de Bordeaux... bred to kill.
           But Contango and Backwardation here
           are socialized since birth so they're
           harmless.
          Jacob laughs...

                          JACOB
           You named your dogs after technical
           futures market terms?
          And Bretton stands...

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Of course not...
           (with a wink)
           My children did.
          As he heads into...

          THE LIVING ROOM
          A fire burning in the fireplace. Jacob follows Bretton in...

                          JACOB
           And where are your children?
          Bretton moves toward a table with a classic phonograph player
          on it.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Greece with my wife. My boys are
           studying The Iliad now.
          While Bretton looks through the various sleeves of records,
          Contango and Backwardation slowly find their way into the
          room and sit by the fire.
          Bretton finds what he's looking for... removing the record
          from its sleeve.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           Here it is... one of the most
           beautiful pieces of music you'll ever
           hear.
          Bretton places the record on the phonograph and The Rolling
          Stones "Let It Loose" rings out...

           58.

                         

                         

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           "Exile On Main Street," without a
           doubt The Stones greatest album.
          Jacob laughs. He was expecting Beethoven.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           It was all outtakes. Throwaway
           tracks. And the critics hated it.
           And it didn't sell well at first.

                          (BEAT)
           But now it's universally known as
           their best release. I asked Mick once
           how he thought that happened. How
           something could go from so worthless
           to so valuable. He just looked at me
           and said... "it never went from
           worthless to valuable... just the
           opinions of it did."
          Taking a seat...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           And that was the greatest lesson I
           ever learned about investing.

                          JACOB
           An asset's value can only be priced at
           its perception.

                          BRETTON WOODS

                          (IMPRESSED)
           Exactly. There is no intrinsic.
          Then... simply...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           You'll work out of the New York
           office. I wouldn't want to pull you
           away from your fiancee in Washington.

                          JACOB
           Thank you.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           She's Gordon Gekko's daughter.

                          JACOB
           That's right.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           He was a legend at one time. It's
           quite sad how he publicly cries out
           wolf now.
          Bretton stands and stretches.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           You see, for a legend...

           59.

                         

                         
          Inside of a tired sigh...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           ... the only thing worse than death is
           becoming irrelevant.
          And Bretton just sits there... enjoying his scotch while
          taking in the Stones tune...

          INT. LONDON/SAVOY HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

          Jacob stands at the window of his suite... looking out onto
          the Victoria embankment and on the phone with...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Good work, kid -- you're on the inside
           now.

                          JACOB
           He's going to Dubai to raise some
           money then meeting me in New York to
           set me up.
          Gordon sits at the dining room table at his apartment.
          Papers scattered about and his EDITOR waiting patiently.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           No.

                          JACOB
           What?

                          GORDON GEKKO
           He's not meeting you in New York.

                          JACOB
           Why not?

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Because you need to go to Dubai with
           him.

                          JACOB
           I don't understand.

          EXT. LONDON - DAY

          As the 727 takes off ...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.)
           You need to do something that will
           earn his trust... you need to make
           yourself a hero...

          INT. 727 - DAY

          Jacob sits across from Bretton who enjoys a slice of Pizza
          and a Coke.

           60.

                         

                         

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.)
           Jacob... you need to help him get this
           money.
          And Jacob glares at Bretton like he might kill him.

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           But be cautious. Your relationship
           with Bretton is still fragile -- you
           fuck it up here and you're done.
          Bretton looks up and Jacob immediately replaces his glare
          with a smile.

                          JACOB
           Looks better than meals I get on
           United.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           John's Pizza on Bleeker. It crossed
           the Atlantic with you yesterday.
           Would you like a slice?
          Jacob declines... then...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           I appreciate you wanting to help with
           this part of the business even though
           it's not your expertise.

                          JACOB
           Well -- there's a lot I can learn from
           you.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           For this trip just stay in the
           background and observe.
          As Bretton tosses some pizza to Contango and Backwardation...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           We're going to meet with Oleg Bakunin.
           He's a Russian oligarch on the run
           because Putin wanted to steal
           everything he owns. He already has a
           few hundred million with us but I'm
           looking to get half a billion more.
           Our maintenance fee on that alone
           would be ten million a year.

                          (BEAT)
           My father didn't make half of that in
           his twenty-six year career.
          And he looks out the window...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           He worked in a mid-level job for
           United Bancorp actually...

           61.

                         

                         
          Never to look from the window... with just a trace of
          disdain...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           Got a fishing kit when he retired.

          EXT. DUBAI/AERIAL VIEW - DAY

          The most bizarre, stunning city in the world -- outlandish
          skyscrapers, marinas, archipelagos...
          And the 727 is now flying over...

          THE WORLD OF ISLANDS
          A collection of man-made islands that make out a one-
          dimensional map-like depiction of Earth.
          As we fly over this archipelago...

           BRETTON WOODS (V.O.)
           Richard Branson purchased Great
           Britain, Rod Stewart bought Germany,
           Tommy Lee bought Greece.

          BECKER JETVAN LUXURY COACH
          It's custom outfitted Mercedes-Benz van that's completely
          decked out like the inside of a private jet. Full
          entertainment system, recessed LED lighting, tray tables,
          fine leather, blacked out windows that "defog" with the push
          of a button, designed by Phillipe Starck and made custom for
          $450,000 (once you get to the top of the waiting list.)
          Jacob and Bretton ride into the city. Bretton takes a call
          on his Vertu.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

                          (INTO PHONE)
           Yes... you have to be kidding me.
          He disconnects the call with a mischievous smile and turns to
          Jacob.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           Looks like a bit of news broke while
           we were in the air...
          And Bretton turns on Fox Business to see footage of... The
          Governor of New York standing at a podium next to his WIFE.
          He doesn't look happy as he says...

           GOVERNOR (ON THE TV)
           The remorse I feel will always be with
           me. Words cannot describe how
           grateful I am for the love and
           compassion they have shown me. From
           those to whom much is given, much is
           expected..

           62.

                         

                         
          Jacob's confused... Bretton's enjoying every second of
          this...

                          BRETTON WOODS
           He's been after us for years...

           GOVERNOR (ON THE TV)
           I have been given much -- the love of
           my family, the faith and trust of the
           people of New York, and the chance to
           lead this state
          Laughing with delight...

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Oh Jacob... you don't want to live in
           a glass house if you're gonna play
           this game.

                          JACOB
           I don't understand. Is he resigning?

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Yes sir.

                          JACOB
           What'd he do?
          And Bretton simply turns to him and says...

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Outsourced.

          EXT. BURJ AL ARAB HOTEL - DAY

          1,000-foot-tall feat of modern design, perched on the edge of
          the Persian Gulf.
          As the Jetvan pulls out front...

           BRETTON WOODS (V.O.)
           There's a big party for Oleg tonight
           at a club called The Left Bank. It's
           Roaring 20s themed so I've had
           original suits from that era delivered
           to our rooms.

          INT. BURJ AL ARAB/LOBBY - DAY

          As Jacob and Bretton walk through the ridiculously opulent
          lobby plated in gold leaf.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Remember. Hedge funds are not banking
           and this isn't Ivy-league-geography-
           ninth-hole deal making.

           63.

                         

                         

          INT. HALLWAY - DAY

          As they walk down the hall to their suites... Contango and
          Backwardation tagging along.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Oleg's a brute, he's has A.D.D. and he
           likes to party.
          As they stop in front of large double doors... the BELLMAN
          opens the doors to reveal...

          THE BURJ AL ARAB PREMIERE SUITE
          Makes the Rainman Suite at Caesar's look like a standard room
          at a Motel 6. 7000 square feet, 360 degree view, 70 inch
          plasmas share the walls with Picassos and Monets.
          Bretton nods over to the double doors across the hall...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           I'm just down the hall.
           (with a smile)
           I hope you don't mind I took the nicer
           one.

          INT. JACOB'S SUITE/BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Now dressed in a tightly-fitting suit over a white shirt with
          wing collars and stove-pipe skinny trousers, Jacob stands in
          front of the mirror.
          As Jacob throws on a top hat and admires the 1928 version of
          himself....

          INT. THE LEFT BANK - NIGHT

          A Roaring 20's party is taking place... it's full-on
          speakeasy vibe. It's right out of 1928, only with Europeans,
          Russians and Middle-Easterners.
          Smoke fills the room. A jazz band roars. Drinks flow.
          As Jacob and Bretton head in...

                          BRETTON WOODS
           If he offers you a drink -- take it.
          And with that, Bretton points across the room where OLEG
          BAKUNIN sits.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           If he offers you a line of coke --
           snort it.
          He's in his mid-40s, overweight, sweaty, draped in tight
          black Prada and smoking a cigarette.

           64.

                         

                         

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           If he offers you a child -- raise it.
          And it seems A MODEL BOMB has recently exploded at Oleg's
          table... leaving the skinny shards everywhere.
          Oleg sees them, stands and opens his arms.

                          OLEG
           Bretton Woods has arrived.
          Bretton smiles. They head over. Oleg turns to one of the
          MODEL GIRLS next to him.

                          OLEG (CONT'D)
           I want you to meet one of the only men
           in the world who might be as rich as I
           am. Wait a minute... Bretton what did
           oil close at today?

                          BRETTON WOODS
           A hundred and twenty-nine dollars a
           barrel.

                          OLEG
           (to Model Girl)
           Forget what I said -- I'm much richer
           than him.
          Oleg then looks at Jacob.

                          OLEG (CONT'D)
           Who the fuck is this?

                          JACOB
           Oleg, I'm Jacob Moore. It's nice to
           meet you.
          Oleg regards Jacob for a beat, then back to Bretton and asks
          again...

                          OLEG
           Who the fuck is this?
          Bretton smiles...

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Jacob has recently come over from KZI
           to work with me.
          And now Oleg turns to Jacob.

                          OLEG
           KZI? You worked with Andrew Zabel?
          Jacob takes a beat. Then...

                          JACOB
           That's right.

           65.

                         

                         

                          OLEG
           He was a legend.
          Jacob just nods, not showing any emotion. Oleg motions for
          the girls to make room and they all sit...

                          OLEG (CONT'D)
           It was that mortgage shit. He
           should've just focused on managing
           money and not fuck around with that
           crazy mortgage shit.
          Bretton just looks away. Jacob stays cool.

                          OLEG (CONT'D)
           It was a shame his fund was only for
           institutions... I would've liked to
           have invested.
          Oleg motions to a WAITRESS who immediately pours vintage
          champagne.

                          OLEG (CONT'D)
           In honor of the theme tonight, have a
           glass of 1927 Heidsiek champagne...
          Oleg hands Jacob a flute before he can decline.

                          OLEG (CONT'D)
           This is one of two hundred bottles
           discovered on a shipwreck off the
           coast of Finland... thirty grand a
           bottle.
          And Oleg aggressively puts his arm around Jacob, bringing him
          into a drunken half-bear hug and spilling most of the
          champagne out of Jacob's flute.

          EXT. DUBAI HARBOR - NIGHT

          Oleg and some of his crew lead Jacob, Bretton and three
          beautiful, giggling model girls down a trail to a secluded
          mooring.
          Fishing boats bob violently in the water -- and next to them
          is Oleg's Phoenix 1000, his personal, 65-meter SUBMARINE.
          As a boatman helps them all climb aboard:

                          OLEG
           Phoenix 1000.

          INT. SUBMARINE - NIGHT

          As they walk through the ornate deck saloon:
          Oleg beckons Jasper toward a huge panoramic window looking
          out at the city of Dubai.

           66.

                         

                         
          And then the view starts to MOVE. The surface of the water
          RISES before them, Dubai recedes and the submarine descends
          spectacularly into the depths.

                          OLEG
           5000 square feet, 30 days of oxygen
           capacity.

          INT. THE DECK SALOON - NIGHT

          Lights illuminate the dark waters as curious fish flit past.
          Jacob, Bretton and Oleg are on divans, the girls undulating
          around them.

                          OLEG
           Bretton, I have... what?... two
           hundred million with you.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           And hopefully that's just a start.
           Oleg, there are so many opportunities
           out there right now I feel like a kid
           in the candy store.
          Oleg waves him off.

                          OLEG
           You know I like to spread it around...
           I'm like my own fund of funds. I
           don't like to have too much with one
           manager.
          As Oleg shakes cocaine out of an envelope...

                          OLEG (CONT'D)
           You never really know who to trust in
           this world.
          Jacob takes a beat, swallows nervously, then...

                          JACOB
           I couldn't agree more, Oleg. It's one
           of the first things that Andrew Zabel
           taught me. I worked very closely with
           him. It's why Bretton hired me. To
           get behind the Andrew Zabel curtain.
          Bretton flashes Jacob a look... "What the hell are you
          doing?" Jacob swallows back some nerves then continues...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           You said before that you always wanted
           to invest with Zabel but couldn't
           because he only handled institutional
           money. Well here's your chance.
           Zabel taught me everything he knew.
          Oleg looks up to Jacob from the line of coke with interest.

           67.

                         

                         

                          OLEG
           Such as... ?

                          JACOB
           Well, I'm not going to give you the
           whole cake, Oleg...
          He looks over to Bretton who still glares at Jacob...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           But I can give you a little bite...

                          (BEAT)
           It involves building positions in high
           yielding stocks new to volatility then
           writing calls with split strike
           prices.
          And Oleg regards Jacob for a long moment, a jury determining
          the verdict... Jacob holding on to that sly smile... Bretton
          looking away... playing it cool.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           It's complicated but like Bretton said
           -- right now there are more
           opportunities than ever.
          Oleg simply nods... with a simple...

                          OLEG
           Interesting.
          ... then does another line.

          INT. JACOB'S SUITE - NIGHT

          Jacob sleeps. There's a knock on his door. He stirs. The
          knock's louder. Then... Jacob finally wakes, moves to the
          door and opens it to see...
          TWO BEAUTIFUL RUSSIAN WOMEN, PAULINA and NADIA

                          NADIA
           We're here for the party.
          Confused...

                          JACOB
           What party?

                          PAULINA
           Oleg said you needed a party...
          Cozying up to her friend with a smile...

                          NADIA
           ... and we're it.
          Jacob nervously thinks, then...

           68.

                         

                         

                          JACOB
           Come in.

          INT. JACOB'S SUITE - LATER

          We pan across the suite... past the roaring fire...

           PAULINA (O.S.)
           Right there... ?
          ... past the empty bottle of champagne...

           JACOB (O.S.)
           No... not there...

           NADIA (O.S.)
           How about there? I bet you want me to
           do it there.
          ... past the plate of half-eaten chocolate strawberries...

           JACOB (O.S.)
           No... I want you to hold it.
          And find the three of them...

           NADIA (O.S.)
           But it's gone up so much.
          ... sitting at Jacob's computer... looking over a chart for a
          Russian oil company.

                          JACOB
           I know... but if you're going to
           correctly utilize this technical head
           and shoulders strategy, you need to
           hold the stock until...
           (pointing on the chart)
           ... right here.

                          PAULINA
           I always sell too soon.

                          JACOB
           Very common mistake. You need to cut
           your losers short and let your winners
           run.
          She looks to her friend with a smile...

                          NADIA
           Good advice for everything... no?
          Her friend agrees with a laugh. And Jacob checks the clock.

                          JACOB
           Okay. I think enough time has passed.
           I appreciate you guys keeping our
           little secret.

           69.

                         

                         
          As he walks them to the door...

                          NADIA
           You must love her very much.

                          JACOB
           I do.
          Jacob opens the door to let them go but he hears a door open
          across the hall... Bretton's.
          And they all witness a YOUNGER AMERICAN WOMAN leave Bretton's
          room then head down the hall right by them.
          Jacob's stunned.

                          PAULINA
           The most famous hooker in the world.
          Off Jacob's confusion...

          THE YOUNGER AMERICAN WOMAN
          that had just left Bretton's room looks right at us under the
          caption "The Governor's $5000 Mistake"
          Pull back to be on Perezhilton.com
          Jacob Moore sits in front of his computer. And he turns to
          Paulina.

                          JACOB
           Is she a gift from Oleg?

                          PAULINA
           No. She's Bretton's go-to.

                          NADIA
           He flies her in wherever he's at.
          And Jacob slowly takes that in... absolutely floored.

          INT. BURJ AL ARAB/LOBBY - MORNING

          Wearing sunglasses, Jacob greets Bretton at the elevators.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           You look like crap.
          They walk for the exit.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           Let me ask you something... was that
           speech about split strike prices and
           stocks new to volatility for real?

                          JACOB
           No Bretton. That was all bullshit.

           70.

                         

                         
          Bretton smiles.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Well, it worked. Oleg's wiring us
           five hundred million dollars today.
          And Bretton turns to Jacob... impressed.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           Good job, Jacob...
          And as they head out into the Dubai heat...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.)(PRE-LAP)
           So he trust you now.

          EXT. BOWLING GREEN PARK - DAY

          The iconic charging bull of Wall Street.

           JACOB (V.O.)
           I think so.
          Travel the park to find... Jacob and Gordon stopping at the
          food vendors.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Well, I'm happy to help.

                          (AND THEN)
           What about your end of the trade,
           Sport?

                          JACOB
           Oh... I'm still working on it.

                          (BEAT)
           I'll talk to her. I promise.

                          GORDON GEKKO

                          (TO VENDOR)
           Hot dog.

                          (TO JACOB)
           What do you want?

                          JACOB

                          (TO VENDOR)
           I'll take a pretzel.
          As they get their food and walk...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           So you're a hedge fund cowboy now?
          Shaking his head...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           Goddamn hedge funds -- what a racket.
           Playing the world casino, betting
           other people's money with leverage.
           And it's completely legal and
           completely unregulated.

                          (MORE)

           71.

                         

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           The hustles they get away with make
           insider trading seem like a parking
           ticket.

          SLAM INTO THE FRONTIER FUND/TRADING PIT
          Rows and rows of computers in a large dark room....

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Nassim Tariq and his Frontier Fund.
           With their slews of MIT grads who
           become glorified millionaire robots
           pushing buttons...
          ... with casually dressed ASIANS and INDIANS in their 20s
          working the keyboards like zombies.

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           ... slaves to top-secret propriety
           elegant algorithms that work until
           they don't.

          AND SLAM INTO ESSEX CAPITAL ADVISERS/CONFERENCE ROOM
          A stuffy conference room half-filled with bored MEN in their
          40s watching a presentation...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Or the baby cub funds like Sammy
           Rosen's Essex Advisers... filled with
           Goldman Sachs and Julian Robertson
           pedigree.
          Most of the men type on their blackberrys... one is actually
          asleep.

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Men who are way too rich, lazy and
           tired to run money properly anymore.

          THEN SLAM INTO THE DANIELS ACTIVIST FUND/ALLAN DANIELS'S

                         OFFICE
          A small cluttered office with papers strewn about...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Or Allan Daniel's and his bully
           operation.
          ALLAN DANIELS, a small bull-dog of a man, paces back and
          forth... dictating in anger. His SECRETARY types down every
          word he's shouting.

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           ... with his angry letters to company
           boards that are nothing but veiled
           threats in the name of activism.

          AND RIGHT BACK TO BOWLING GREEN PARK
          Where Gordon stops walking...

           72.

                         

                         

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           So you're inside... you have his
           trust... and now you want to know
           what's next.
          And Jacob's look over to Gekko confirms this.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           Here's the thing about Bretton. He
           puts all of his money into his own
           fund which makes him stupid,
           egotistical, and most importantly...
           vulnerable.

                          (BEAT)
           And he chases. He doesn't take losses
           well and he chases with leverage. He
           thinks he's a trader, he thinks he's
           an investor but he's not. He's a
           gambler.
          Regarding Jacob...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           That pretzel looks good.
          Jacob just shrugs.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           Care to make a trade?

                          JACOB
           Whatever.
          And they trade. The hotdog for the pretzel.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           As for your end of our trade.

                          (BEAT)
           Find a way for me to reunite with my
           daughter, Jake. Because we both know
           how she would react to the fact that
           you've been lying to her about bonding
           with your future father-in-law.
          Just standing there... holding that hot dog...

                          JACOB
           Is that a threat?
          Looking Jacob dead on...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Absolutely.
          Jacob just shakes his head with a laugh... now realizing that
          Gekko talked him into this position for this exact leverage.

                          JACOB
           You're priceless, Gordon.

           73.

                         

                         
          With a smile...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Just be happy I'm on your team.

                          (AND THEN)
           Get him into a bad position and watch
           him chase it.

                          JACOB
           What bad position?

                          GORDON GEKKO
           What have I been saying all along,
           Kid?

                          JACOB
           Financials.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           They're a death trap -- mark my words.

          INT. THE LOCUST FUND/JACOB'S OFFICE - DAY

          As Jacob takes in his new view... it's spectacular.

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.)
           But he won't fall for a brokerage or
           bank play this late in the game.
           Everyone knows they're poison.

          AND TIME LAPSE
          As the office grows furniture... a plasma on the wall...
          a computer on the desk...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Sell him on insurance. There's a case
           to be made for those stocks... ill-
           fated as they may be.
          ... books on the shelves... pictures on the walls...
          a couch and table... a paper shredder and waste baskets...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           But take your time... make him think
           you've been doing your due diligence.
          Find Jacob at his desk... working away at his computer...
          it's late at night.

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Make it look like you're working your
           ass off to find him this genius
           trade... come in early, leave late and
           don't bring up the idea for at least a
           few weeks.
          And Jacob finally gets up from his desk... goes to the
          window... looking across midtown Manhattan...

           74.

                         

                         

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           And then Jacob...
          ... eyes pasted on a building made of glass and steel... a
          building he once called home...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           ... sell him hard... then watch him
           bite... then watch him chase...
          ... KZI Investments.

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           ... then watch him come undone.

          EXT. 533 THIRD AVENUE - DAY

          Holding his suitcase, Jacob emerges from the elevator and
          heads for a waiting town car.
          Jacob sees Diego...

                          JACOB
           Bring it.
          Diego smiles... loves this new one...

                          DIEGO
           What's the most dangerous question on
           Wall Street?

                          JACOB
           Tell me.

                          DIEGO
           "How are you?"
          And Jacob agrees whole-heartedly as he heads on his way.

          EXT. WASHINGTON DC - MORNING

          As the sun rises over our nation's capital.

          EXT. ROCK CREEK PARK - MORNING

          Winnie and Jacob jog the park through the humid July haze.
          It's very early.
          And Jacob stops jogging. Catches his breath. She keeps
          running.

                          JACOB
           Why are you with me?
          She stops and turns back to him.

                          WINNIE
           What?

           75.

                         

                         

                          JACOB
           You hate finance. You hate Wall
           Street. Why are you with me?
          Winnie nods. It's a valid question. And she thinks about it
          for a moment, then...

                          WINNIE
           Repetition compulsion.

                          JACOB
           Huh?

                          WINNIE
           It's Freud.

                          JACOB
           And what does it mean, psych major?

                          WINNIE
           Well, it's when people repeat the same
           dysfunctional relationships from
           childhood in their adult life in hopes
           of trying to master them.

                          JACOB
           Like when children of alcoholics fall
           in love with alcoholics.

                          WINNIE
           Yeah.
          He turns away... upset.

                          JACOB
           That's great, Winnie.

                          WINNIE
           Jacob, that might be why I was
           initially attracted to you... but it's
           not why I love you.
          She moves to him.

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)
           I love you because you're
           compassionate and you care so deeply
           about what you do and you have like no
           ego, it's crazy.
          She reaches to him... turning his face to meet hers.

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)
           And you're the smartest person I've
           ever met... and there's nobody I trust
           more in the world.
          Jacob looks away... almost ashamed. And Winnie can sense
          something's not right.

           76.

                         

                         

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)
           What's wrong?

                          JACOB
           Nothing...
          As Jacob draws in a deep breath, collects himself and finally
          turns back to her with...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           I just wish you would master that
           relationship from childhood so you can
           move forward with this one.

          AND WERE BACK ON THE CHART
          As a circle forms on July 20th then travels down the trend
          and stops.
          And as a circle is formed around August 11th, we...

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. WESTSIDE HIGHWAY- DAY

          And Manhattan... as it sweats through the heart of summer.
          Two jetvans ride uptown...

          INT. JETVAN - DAY

          As Jacob rides with Bretton...

                          JACOB
           Bretton... I found something I like.
          Bretton looks over to him.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           I've been wondering when my new
           portfolio manager was going to come to
           me with something special.

                          JACOB
           I just wanted to make sure I would be
           bringing you the smartest idea
           possible. I know you don't go light.
          Confirming...

                          BRETTON WOODS
           That's right. If I commit to this...
           we go large and we don't back down.

                          JACOB
           It might be better to do this in the
           office. I have color and support to

                          PRESENT--
          Waving him off...

           77.

                         

                         

                          BRETTON WOODS
           C'mon Jacob, you know that's not how
           we do.

          EXT. ADIRONDACK FOREST PRESERVE - DAY

          2.7 million acres of State protected majestic land. All
          nature... rivers and lakes... cypresses and maples. Clean
          air. And trails. Many trails that go on for miles.
          As the two Becker jetvans arrive at a restricted area, a
          STATE RANGER opens the gate and allows them to drive through
          then park.
          Jacob and Bretton emerge from the jetvan.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           This is how we do.
          And with a nod, the DRIVER of the other jetvan opens it to
          reveal two motorcycles inside. Bretton's MTT Turbine
          Superbike and an Agusta, these bikes are handcrafted works of
          art as much as they are demons of speed.
          Jacob laughs in disbelief and excitement.

                          JACOB
           And we're allowed to ride these
           through here?
          Sucking in the fresh summer air...

                          BRETTON WOODS
           No.

          AND JACOB AND BRETTON
          Now decked out in leather riding gear... on the bikes... at
          the mouth of the trail... revving the engines...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           Follow me...
          And with that, shoots into the forest. Jacob quickly
          follows.

          AND THEY RIDE
          Winding through the trees... along the side of a river...
          Bretton riding extremely fast with Jacob trying to keep up.
          Bretton reaches a clearing and waits for Jacob to catch up.
          Once he does...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           You're going to have to keep up.

                          JACOB
           Okay. I'm just getting used to it.

           78.

                         

                         

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Tell me your idea.

                          JACOB
           Here?

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Where else?

                          JACOB
           Right. Okay.

                          (COLLECTING HIMSELF)
           Are you still short any of the
           financials?

                          BRETTON WOODS
           No. After KZI, I took profits.

                          JACOB
           I think it's time to go the other way.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Banks?

                          JACOB
           Insurance companies. I'm talking the
           old school insurers that have become
           the babies thrown out with the bath
           water.
          Jacob waits for a reaction from Bretton. But all he gets
          is...

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Keep up!
          And with that, Bretton rips into the clearing. Jacob rides
          just as fast. They're neck and neck... it's definitely a
          race.
          Bretton pulls ahead but Jacob doesn't give up.
          As they move quickly toward a patch of forest with a only
          narrow trail entering it, Jacob focuses on the horizon and
          revs the bike into more speed. He pulls up next to Bretton
          as they approach the trail.
          If Jacob doesn't slow down, and fall in line behind Bretton,
          he's going to hit the trees. But he doesn't.
          Instead, Jacob blasts the bike into its final dose of speed,
          narrowly avoiding impact by zipping into the trail... pulling
          ahead of Bretton and taking the lead.

          A TRANQUIL LAKE
          As it sits still in the setting sun. Untouched by man.
          Bretton and Jacob get off the bikes and walk to the shore.
          As they catch their breaths and enjoy the beauty...

           79.

                         

                         

                          JACOB
           The basket of stocks I'm putting
           together focuses on reinsurance
           brokering and management services for
           businesses. They're trading below
           book and have large dividends.

                          (BEAT)
           I say we buy them here.
          Bretton thinks about it. He's not sure.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Financials are a falling knife.
          Jacob nods...

                          JACOB
           I'm not arguing that... but the best
           opportunities are found where angels
           fear to tread.
          Jacob can see... he has Bretton on the hook.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           So yeah -- they are falling knives.
           But Bretton...
          And with confidence... driving it home...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           ... what's life without a little blood
           on your hands?

          INT. JACOB'S OFFICE - DAY

          As WORKERS install an electronic ticker that wraps around the
          top circumference of the whole office... similar to the one
          Andrew Zabel had.

           BRETTON WOODS (V.O.)
           Okay. Then I want you to build
           positions in your favorite three
           names.
          Jacob picks up the phone and...

          THE SCREEN SPLITS IN TWO
          With Jacob on top and Robby on the bottom.
          As Robby takes the order and starts typing into his
          Bloomberg...

           BRETTON WOODS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           I want you stealth. Use all six
           trading desks we're in business with.

          NOW ROBBY'S HALF OF THE SCREEN SPLITS INTO 6 SMALL BOXES

           80.

                         

                         
          Six different trading desks... six different BROKERS taking
          calls from Jacob who still owns the whole top half of the
          screen.

           BRETTON WOODS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           And if they go down... we increase our
           size.

          AND BACK TO JACOB
          Leaning back... feet on desk... staring at the ticker...
          which only has three stocks on it...

           BRETTON WOODS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           See Jacob -- I don't believe in
           "wrong."
          MCC at $21.65, ACN at $16.24 and ISS at $7.23.

           BRETTON WOODS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           I only believe in "not right yet."

          EXT. UPPER WEST SIDE - NIGHT

          A rainstorm takes over the city. A cab pulls out front of
          Shun Lee Cafe.

          INT. TAXI - NIGHT

          Winnie sucks in a deep breath.

                          WINNIE
           He chose this restaurant.
          Jacob confirms.

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)
           We used to come here every Sunday
           night.
          He takes her hand.

                          JACOB
           You're going to be fine.

                          WINNIE
           I'm only doing this for you.

                          JACOB
           No. You're doing this for you.
          She just glares at him.

                          WINNIE
           We're never having sex again.

                          JACOB
           Then what my friends say about
           marriage will be true.

           81.

                         

                         
          And she nervously fights back a smile...

                          WINNIE
           Oh, shut up.

          INT. SHUN LEE CAFE - NIGHT

          The HOST leads Winnie and Jacob through the grand dining
          room. Gordon sees them and stands up. We can tell he's
          anxious as well.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Hi.
          Fighting back the nerves...

                          WINNIE
           Hey.
          They just stand there. Jacob holds out his hand.

                          JACOB
           Mr. Gekko, I'm Jacob Moore, we spoke
           on the phone. Nice to finally meet in
           person.
          Gekko just looks at him for an extra long beat, then...
          shakes his hand.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Yes.
          They all sit.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           Jacob, shall we get some wine?

                          JACOB
           I don't drink.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Oh... okay.
          Then Gordon attempts a smile over to his daughter.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           Let me guess... the ginger garlic
           lobster.

                          WINNIE

                          (TO JACOB)
           I used to order that every time.
          She closes her menu.

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)
           I'm not really hungry.

           82.

                         

                         

                          GORDON GEKKO
           I've been following your career,
           Winnie. Senator Lehigh said some very
           nice things about you in The American
           Prospect interview.

                          WINNIE
           Yeah. She's really been... very...
           supportive of my...
          And it trails off... as she just glares at Gordon.

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)
           I can't do this.
          She exhales, stands and looks down to Jacob.

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)
           I'm sorry. I can't do this.
          And she quickly walks off. Jacob frozen. Until Gordon looks
          over to him with...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           It's okay. This is a long term
           investment.

                          (BEAT)
           Go after her. She needs you.
          And Jacob does. As Gordon looks down... disappointed.

          INT. WEST 65TH - NIGHT

          Pouring rain. Jacob runs after her.

                          JACOB
           Winnie... Winnie...
          He turns her around.

                          WINNIE
           You don't understand.
          Her tears being washed away by the rain.

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)
           My mother couldn't handle Rudy. He
           was so out of control. I couldn't
           help him.
          Jacob takes her into his hold...

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)

                          (RE GEKKO)
           If he wasn't in prison... if he had
           been there. I know it would've been
           different.

                          JACOB
           Your brother's dead, Winnie.

           83.

                         

                         
          Squeezing her tight...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           Your father isn't.

                          WINNIE
           He's not the person people think he
           is.

                          JACOB
           It was a long time ago.
          She pulls out of his embrace...

                          WINNIE
           He'll hurt us. Can't we just go home?
           Please... Jacob. It's raining.
          And he just looks at her for a long moment... soaking wet and
          shivering... crying and exposed.

                          JACOB
           (what am I doing?)
           I love you. You don't have to do
           this.

                          (AND THEN)
           Let's just go home.

          INT. JACOB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Darkness. The phone rings. Jacob answers it.

                          JACOB
           Yes.

          INTERCUT WITH...

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Your insurance companies are down.
          He's working a coffee in the master suite of The Black Swan
          Home...

                          JACOB
           Bretton.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           I want to increase our size.
          Glancing at the LCD, 12:23am...

                          JACOB
           Okay. Good. It's just a matter of
           time before they turn. I'll call the

                          DESKS TOMORROW--

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Jacob, I want you to triple our
           positions on all three.

           84.

                         

                         
          Jacob takes a beat.

                          JACOB
           Okay.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           And they better fucking go up.
          Click. And as Jacob just looks at the phone...

           GORDON GEKKO (PRELAP)
           The instant you know you're in trouble
           is the exact moment when a sound
           investment thesis turns into blind
           hope.

          INT. NORMA'S - MORNING

          Jacob sits across from Gordon at this well-known breakfast
          spot in the Parker Meridian hotel.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Tripling the size... that's a very
           aggressive move.
          Jacob nods.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           And I promise you he's using leverage
           to do this.

                          JACOB
           He's chasing.
          Suddenly, a MAN approaches the table. He's in his thirties.

                          TOM
           Mr Gekko, I'm Tom Sanders. I write
           for Barrons.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           I've heard of it.
          Letting out a little laugh...

                          TOM
           I'm sure you have.

                          (BEAT)
           Well, I'm doing a piece of Wall Street
           moguls who ended up going to prison.
           I've already talked to Boesky and
           Milken and would love to sit down with
           you.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Can you give me the cover?
          Tom isn't sure if Gordon's serious. Either is Jacob.

           85.

                         

                         

                          TOM
           Well, I... um... don't make those
           decisions.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Get me the cover and I'll give you
           seventy minutes.
          Tom politely smiles.

                          TOM
           I'll... take that as a no.
          ... and goes. Gordon looks down to his breakfast and quietly
          asserts...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           (almost to himself)
           Both those assholes got the cover when
           they were convicted.
          And after a moment...

                          JACOB
           How do we know the insurance companies
           are going to continue going down?
          As he casually places his egg on a piece of toast...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           It's all going down.
          ... and takes a bite.

          AND THREE CHARTS NOW FILL THE SCREEN
          Side by side... above the charts are written respectively
          MCC, ACN and ISS.
          And we follow all the three trend lines from Aug 17th forward
          to the right... and they all move down.

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Just wait.
          And we stop in September. And as a blue circle is formed
          over Sept 13th on all three charts, we...

                          CUT TO:

          TIME WARNER CENTER/BALLROOM
          This is The Financial Follies... an annual event held by the
          financial writers association.
          500 people sit at tables, enjoying this dinner and live show
          that pokes fun at people in the world of finance.
          Everyone who's anyone in high finance is here.

           86.

                         

                         
          On the stage, the spotlight finds BILL MAHER and the applause
          breaks out...

                          BILL MAHER
           Welcome to the 2008 Financial Follies!

                          (APPLAUDS)
           I'm Bill Maher and I'm getting paid in
           Euros.
          Jacob shares a table with Bretton, Bretton's wife and a few
          other FINANCIAL PLAYERS. Winnie is not here.

           BILL MAHER (CONT'D)
           When The Financial Writers Association
           asked me to host an event for the
           world of finance, I was shocked. I'm
           known in Washington not Wall Street...

                          (BEAT)
           ... but then they informed me that
           Washington is actually in the process
           of buying Wall Street, so it all makes
           sense.
          Laughter...

           BILL MAHER (CONT'D)
           I asked them if anything's off limits.
           And they said to stay away from the
           brokerages, banks and insurers...
           (pause for effect, then...)
           ... where the fuck was that advice
           five months ago?
          More laughter.

           BILL MAHER (CONT'D)
           I see Sammy Rosen's here.
          The spotlight finds SAMMY ROSEN, billionaire hedge funder.

           BILL MAHER (CONT'D)
           Sammy, how are you?
          From his table...

                          SAMMY ROSEN
           Doing well.

                          BILL MAHER
           (to the room)
           Of course he is... in the amount of
           time it took for us to have that
           exchange, he made three hundred and
           nine thousand dollars.
           (back to Sammy)
           Sammy, let me give you some free
           advice, the next time someone with bad
           eyesight wants to sell you a hundred
           and fifty million dollar painting...
           don't let them personally deliver it.

           87.

                         

                         
          It's an inside joke that this room gets...

           BILL MAHER (CONT'D)
           Somebody told me Gordon Gekko is here.
           Gordon... ?
          Across the room, a spotlight finds Gordon...

           BILL MAHER (CONT'D)
           There you are. I have some inside
           information for you, Gekko... sex
           sells books, not bread lines.
          Gordon smiles and raises his glass up to Bill.

           BILL MAHER (CONT'D)
           Talk about your sour grapes.
           Seriously Gordon -- just because the
           SEC doesn't let you make obscene
           amounts of money by being wrong and
           nefarious doesn't mean you have to
           ruin it for all of these hard working
           people.
          The room applauds...

           BILL MAHER (CONT'D)
           Okay, we have a video to show now.
           It's a very detailed and academic
           account of the current mortgage
           crises. Let `er rip!
          And the room goes dark... and on the screen plays a childlike
          roughly illustrated stick-figure skit being narrated by
          children.

                         FIRST FRAME
          Under the caption "Main Street National Bank" is a drawing of
          a Poor Man sitting across from a Banker Man behind his desk.

                          POOR MAN
           I'd like a mortgage... I don't really
           have any money though... is that cool?

                          BANKER MAN
           Totally cool. Since housing prices
           are always going up it won't be a
           problem.

                          POOR MAN
           You guys are awesome!

                         NEXT FRAME
          Under the caption "A few weeks later at the bank..."
          Banker Man now stands over a pile of steaming shit.

           88.

                         

                         

                          BANKER MAN
           Wow, these mortgages are really
           beginning to smell. I better sell
           them to smart people.

                         NEXT FRAME
          Under the caption of "Smart People Investment Bank" Smart Man
          stands over the same steaming pile of shit.

                          SMART MAN
           Wow, these mortgages we just bought
           really smell. I better sell them to
           foreigners.

                         NEXT FRAME
          Under the caption of "The CDO Factory" our smart man oversees
          an assembly line of stick figure workers.

           SMART MAN (CONT'D)
           Mix those crappy mortgages in real
           good with the clean ones so the rating
           agencies won't smell them.

                         NEXT FRAME
          Under the caption of "Rich Man Hedge Fund" a stick figure
          named Rich Man sits behind his desk and holds a phone to his
          ear.

                          RICH MAN
           Good news, Smart Man, not only did
           foreigners buy those traunches, but so
           did school boards and charities and
           big pensions.

                          (BEAT)
           Why did they buy them you ask? Well,
           they were looking for a really secure
           risk-free investment and they were all
           triple A, so...

                         NEXT FRAME
          Under the caption "Norwegian Village Pension Fund" a
          Norwegian Man sits behind his desk and shouts into his phone.

                          NORWEGIAN MAN
           Hey man! What the fuck? We're not
           receiving our monthly payments!

                         NEXT FRAME
          Under the caption "Rich Man Hedge Fund," Rich Man at his desk
          on the phone.

                          RICH MAN
           Yeah, we fucked up.

           89.

                         

                         
          And it now shuffles between the last two frames... the
          Norwegian Man and Rich Man.

                          NORWEGIAN MAN
           What about the rating agencies?

                          RICH MAN
           Yeah, they fucked up too.

                          NORWEGIAN MAN
           What about the investment bank that
           put these CDO's together?

                          RICH MAN
           Fucked up.

                          NORWEGIAN MAN
           What about the bank that made the
           original loan?

                          RICH MAN
           Totally fucked up.

                          NORWEGIAN MAN
           What am I supposed to tell my
           villagers?

                          RICH MAN
           That you fucked up.
          The final frame
          Just the rendering of that steaming pile of shit under the
          caption... "The End."
          And the lights go on to a some subdued laughter and a
          smattering of applause.

                          BILL MAHER
           What a year -- enjoy the night!

          INT. FINANCIAL FOLLIES - LATER

          Desert is served. Jackets are off, cigars are lit, Bretton's
          wife has gone home. The group at the table is a little drunk
          and having a good time.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           It's a good question... what do you
           think, George?
          GEORGE, an investment banker at the table, thinks about it.

                          GEORGE
           The definition of rich... flying
           private.
          The table reacts... some agree, other don't. George turns to
          Jacob.

           90.

                         

                         

                          GEORGE (CONT'D)
           Jacob... ? What do you think?

                          JACOB
           To be rich... is to have the love of a
           good woman.
          They all boo...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           (with a smile)
           For real... I truly believe that.
          And Jacob turns to Bretton...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           Bretton... what's your definition of
           rich?
          An approaching voice answers it for him.

           VOICE (O.S.)
           To have twice as much money as you
           currently do.
          As he takes a seat...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Isn't that what you always say,
           Bretton?
          Then... announcing to the table...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           He brings up the question, runs it
           round the table then finishes with
           that. It's an old bit.
          Also announcing to the table...

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Be careful Gordon...
           (looking at Jacob)
           ... your daughter's financial health
           is in my hands now.
          Jacob loses his smile... suddenly becoming uncomfortable.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           That's right.

                          (BEAT)
           And the way The Locust Fund has been
           buying up the insurance companies
           lately makes me worried about my
           future grandchildren's college
           educations.

                          JACOB

                          (TO BRETTON)
           I didn't tell him.

           91.

                         

                         

                          BRETTON WOODS
           No, I don't suppose you did.
          Bretton looks over to Jacob.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           Go ahead, Jacob, preach your book...
           defend your names.
          And Jacob turns to Gordon...

                          JACOB
           We have a proactive central bank, the
           charts show a clear bottom on July
           15th and these companies are trading
           at half of what they were six months
           ago.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Just cause it's low don't make it
           cheap, Sport.

                          JACOB
           I read your book.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           It's not out yet.

                          JACOB
           I have a friend in publishing.

                          (BEAT)
           25% unemployment... stagflation...
           bread lines... Martial law...
           government seizures of assets and
           gold... end of democracy...
          Bretton leans back... taking in this sparring match.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           Really Gordon? Do you really need
           attention that badly?

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Since I have forty-four seconds to
           spare, I'm going to tell you a story.
           It's about a guy named Sam.
          And we go close on Gekko...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           Sam used to work a job, he made things
           and he grew things and he sold those
           things. Until one day Sam got a
           credit card and was amazed how easy it
           was to buy things with it. So Sam got
           another card and then another. Then
           he used the credit card money to make
           it look like he had an income... and
           he used that "income" to secure a
           loan.

                          (MORE)

           92.

                         

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           And with that loan Sam bought a fancy
           BMW car and rented a fancy penthouse
           apartment.

                          (BEAT)
           Now, the credit cards hit their limit
           and the bank needed him to service
           that loan, so Sam went to his friends.
           His Chinese friend... and his Japanese
           friend... and his British friend and
           so on. And his friends loaned Sam
           money.

                          (ANOTHER BEAT)
           And that brings us to today... where
           Sam owes the credit cards and Sam owes
           the banks and Sam owes his friends and
           eventually they're going to take away
           Sam's fancy BMW car and his fancy
           penthouse apartment.
          And Jacob can now see... in Gordon Gekko's eyes... he truly
          believes every word he's saying.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           And Sam doesn't make anything anymore
           and Sam doesn't grow anything anymore
           so Sam doesn't sell anything anymore.
          As he stands...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           Our favorite Uncle Sam's desperate,
           Jake... and he just found a printing
           press in his basement.

                          (BEAT)
           So you tell me -- where do we go from
           here?
          And with that, Gordon Gekko goes.

                          BRETTON WOODS

                          (RE GEKKO)
           It is sad isn't it? That he can't
           just take his ball and go home.

                          (BEAT)
           That he has to piss on the whole game.

          EXT. 533 THIRD AVENUE - MORNING

          Rushed, Jacob heads through the lobby of his building. Diego
          catches his stride.

                          DIEGO
           (doing his best Howard

                          COSELL)
           Down goes Lehman! Down goes Lehman!
           Down goes Lehman!
          And Jacob just keeps walking...

           93.

                         

                         

          INT. THE LOCUST FUND/JACOB'S OFFICE - MORNING

          Jacob heads into the office to find Bretton sitting behind
          his desk.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           They're not going to save it. They're
           just going to let it bloody die!
          And sure enough... on the tv... Fox Business runs footage of
          Lehman Brother's demise. On the screen, the chyron screams:

          $700 BILLION GOVERNMENT BAILOUT TO THE BANKS!

           ALEXIS GLICK (ON TV)
           And as another US banking institution
           collapses, Congress is working quickly
           on a bailout package that will
           distribute over three hundred billion
           dollars to other banks in trouble.
          Bretton turns off the tv and looks to Jacob with...

                          BRETTON WOODS
           We're getting fucking killed.
          And Jacob looks up to his electronic ticker...

          MCC $18.53 -2.34, ACN $12.04 -1.35, ISS $7.03 -.65.

                          JACOB
           It's capitulation.
          Bretton holds Jacob's look... fighting to keep his composure.
          Until... he simply stands and offers Jacob his desk back.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Then buy more.
          Jacob takes his chair and reaches for the phone.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           Cost us down to current levels.
          Jacob looks up, surprised.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           It's just a question of time before
           this turns around... right?
          And he glares at Jacob.

                          JACOB
           Right.
          Bretton just stares nervously at the electronic ticker... a
          frazzled gambler talking himself into his bet.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Fuck it.

           94.

                         

                         
          As he goes...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           Leverage is sexy.

          AND WERE BACK ON THE CHART
          As a circle forms on Sept 16th then travels down the trend
          line and stops.
          And as a circle is formed around the Sept 24th, we...

                          CUT TO:

          INT. JACOB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          LCD reads 4:43 am. Jacob lays awake... staring at the
          ceiling.

           WINNIE (O.S.)
           I would hear him in the kitchen.
          Jacob turns to see she's awake.

                          JACOB
           I'm sorry, you have an early train.
           I'm going to just go to the office
           now.
          She leans up.

                          WINNIE
           He didn't want to keep my mother awake
           so he'd go into the kitchen and sit
           there. I could hear him because my
           room was right up the back stairs.
           I'd go and sit with him sometimes.
           We'd eat ice cream.
          Jacob gets out of bed and throws on his robe.

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)
           I was only eight but I could tell he
           was worried about something and that
           made me worried.
           (softly, almost to herself)
           Then the market would go back up and
           he would sleep through the night
           again.

                          JACOB
           It's not the market, Winnie.
          As he sits on the edge of the bed...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           It's just that I haven't been able to
           sleep through the night since...
          The thought trails off... she leans up and kisses him.

           95.

                         

                         

                          WINNIE
           I wish I could tell you something was
           going to come along that would make it
           better but I can't. It's just going
           to take time, Jacob. A lot of time.
          And she looks into his eyes...

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)
           Have you been counting Fridays?
          He slowly nods.

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)
           I still count Tuesdays.

                          (BEAT)
           All seven hundred and twenty eight of
           them.
          He leans over and kisses her forehead.

                          JACOB
           Go back to sleep.
          And he goes...
          After a beat, she sees Jacob's wallet.

                          WINNIE
           (calling out after him)
           Jacob, you forgot...
          She jumps out of bed, grabs the wallet and goes after him,
          but... it opens up and Winnie notices the picture inside.
          And she stops, staring at that picture.
          Her and her father on that white horse... taken years ago.
          A picture she knows she never gave to Jacob.

          INT. THE LOCUST FUND/JACOB'S OFFICE - MORNING

          Jacob heads in and turns on Fox Business...

           BRIAN SULLIVAN (ON TV)
           It's a complete unmitigated bloodbath
           out there. The S&P tried to rally at
           about 10am but it was met with yet
           another brutal wave of selling and
           people... we're now at our lows for
           the day, the week, the month and the
           year.
          Jacob looks up at ticker on the wall.

          MCC $15.13 -3.40, ACN $10.10 -1.96, ISS $5.14 -1.89.

           96.

                         

                         
          And he stares at that ticker... at the The Locust Fund's
          methodical death.
          Suddenly...

           BRETTON WOODS (O.S.)
           Are you happy?
          He stands in the doorway holding a drink.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           We're done.
          And Bretton CHUCKS the drink against the wall and the glass
          shatters. Jacob takes a step back.
          Bretton's in a complete state as he walks over to Jacob's
          desk and SWIPES it clean... papers flying about.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           Finished...
          Now he picks up the chair...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           Bank notices...
          ... throws it against the window... which cracks.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           Margin calls...
          As he punches the monitor of Jacob's Bloomberg...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           Redemptions...
          And Jacob just stands there... wide-eyed. Just looking at...

                         BRETTON WOODS
          Face full of sweat... blood all over his hand... hair strewn
          about... completely out of breath... bloodshot red eyes... a
          beaten down mess of a man.

                          JACOB
           What happened to composure, Bretton?

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Well, I suppose it went to hell with
           your fucking insurance stocks.
          And Bretton calms down, walks to the window.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           It's not making sense to me anymore.
           The market always made sense to me and
           for the most part... I was better than
           it... quicker than it.

                          (MORE)

           97.

                         

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

                          (BEAT)
           But it's moving too fast now and it
           looks like the world is going to shit
           anyway.
          And he faces Jacob Moore.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           If I unwind the fund now I'll still
           walk with six hundred million or so.
          And Jacob's face falls... this is news to him.

                          JACOB
           What?

                          BRETTON WOODS
           It's time to call it a day. Spend
           more time with my family. I suppose
           this moment comes for all of us.

                          JACOB
           You still have six hundred million?
          Bretton vacantly nods.
          And Jacob Moore... trying his best to hide his
          disappointment...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           (almost to himself)
           That's a fortune.
          With a shrug...

                          BRETTON WOODS
           I guess it's all relative.
          Bretton then takes a moment... confirming to himself that
          this is the right decision... then finally looks over to
          Jacob with...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           And Jacob -- you're the worst
           portfolio manager I've ever seen.

          INT. CENTRAL PARK - DUSK

          Sheep's meadow... painted in the soft light of sunset. Fresh
          off his morning run, Gordon wears a sweat suit and works a
          vitamin water. Jacob approaches in his suit.

                          JACOB
           He wants to close the fund... he wants
           to ride off into the fucking sunset...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Okay...

           98.

                         

                         

                          JACOB
           No, it's not okay... because we're so
           fucking close... and he's going to
           walk with six hundred million dollars
           and that's unacceptable.
          And Gordon sighs in defeat...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           I don't know what to tell you, Pal.
           You wanted to make him bleed, I wanted
           my daughter back...
          As he walks...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           ... looks like life brings
           disappointment to us all.
          And Jacob... as he matches Gordon's stride... in a complete
          state.

                          JACOB
           What happened to slaughtering men,
           Gordon? What happened to turning them
           into penny-ante brokers in
           Poughkeepsie?
          Gordon stops walking.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Look at you. This can't possibly be
           the man my daughter fell in love with.
          Jacob turns away.

                          JACOB
           I want to finish the job.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Why?

                          JACOB
           Because nobody gave a shit about me
           before Andrew Zabel came along.
           Because he didn't deserve what he got.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           The universe is an efficient market,
           Kid... we all get what we deserve.

                          JACOB
           Did you?
          Now it's Gordon who looks away.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           I know you cared about him... and I
           know how that motivates. But Jacob...
           he wasn't such a Saint.

           99.

                         

                         
          And with that, Gordon Gekko heads on his way...

                          JACOB
           What's that supposed to mean?

                          GORDON GEKKO
           You don't want to know.
          Jacob steps forward... shouting out after him...

                          JACOB
           I'm sorry she doesn't want anything to
           do with you, Gordon -- I'm sorry she
           doesn't love you!
          Gordon stops walking. Turns...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Okay Jake... you want to know.
          Jacob sharply nods.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           Did you ever think about it? I mean
           really think about it? How someone
           could make money year after year...
           even through bear markets?
          Jacob just stands there... listening...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           On November 15th, 1903 an Italian man
           arrived aboard the S.S. Vancouver in
           Boston. He had two dollars and fifty
           cents to his name. Yet just a few
           years later he was millionaire. You
           wanna know how? He had invented a
           scheme... it was quite simple
           actually.
          And Jacob now steps forward... piecing it together...

                          JACOB
           No...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           He would get people to invest with him
           by offering larger than normal returns
           then pay the old investors with the
           new investors money. As long as there
           was fresh money, he could keep going.
           Do you know what his name was, Jacob?
           It was Charles...

                          (BEAT)
           Charles Ponzi.

          FLASH TO AN OLD BRICK BUILDING
          "Jenkov Foundation For Brain Research" above the door...
          RESEARCHERS in lab coats coming in and out of it.

           100.

                         

                         

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Research facilities...

          THEN TO A COLLEGE CAMPUS
          STUDENTS walking the quad... wearing backpacks and
          socializing...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           And scholarships...

          THEN TO A BIKE PATH
          Somewhere in Florida. A COUPLE in their 70s enjoying a
          beautiful day... riding bicycles side by side...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           And retirees...

          AND RIGHT BACK TO CENTRAL PARK
          Gordon steps forward...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           All of them went to bed thinking they
           were perfectly fine... are going to
           wake up to find they're completely
           wiped out...

                          JACOB
           You're lying.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           I'm not, Son. I wish I were.
          Jacob just stands there... stunned with what he's hearing.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           See Jacob, you knew how to get that
           out of me. By playing me off of what
           I really want... my daughter back.

                          (BEAT)
           So you need get Bretton back in the
           game... play him off of what he really
           wants.
          And off Jacob's reaction...

          INT. 15TH STREET DINER - NIGHT

          Jacob shares a table with our Morgan Stanley Portfolio
          Manager.

           MORGAN PORTFOLIO MANAGER
           It's ugly out there dude. I wake up
           everyday wondering if today's the day
           we're going under.

           101.

                         

                         

                          JACOB
           I know. But I do have something for
           you...
          And as Morgan Portfolio Manager leans forward in
          anticipation...

          INT. TOYOTA DEALERSHIP - DAY

          As Jacob and Hedge Fund PM walk the floor... checking out the
          new 2009 Prius.

           HEDGE FUND PM
           I was going to get the new Maserati,
           but... you know...
          Jacob slowly nods. Then...

                          JACOB
           So I heard something earlier today...

          EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - DAY

          As Jacob jogs with our blogger from Streetaccount.com.

                          BLOGGER
           It's so much better working out
           outdoors... that gym was so stuffy.

                          JACOB
           Not to mention expensive.

                          BLOGGER
           Right.

                          JACOB
           So, you've obviously heard the rumor?
          And Blogger looks over to Jacob... he hasn't.

          INT. STREETACCOUNT.COM OFFICES - MORNING

          As our blogger from the gym sips his coffee, fires up his
          computer and starts to type...

          INT. THE CAPITAL FUND/NEW YORK OFFICES - MORNING

          As Hedge Fund PM stands up to present to the team with a

          As the cab stops outside of the building...

          INT. BRETTON WOODS'S OFFICE - NIGHT

          As the thunder claps outside. Jacob stares at the Goya
          painting... Saturno Devorando a sus hijos Saturn. The man
          being eaten alive.

           BRETTON WOODS (O.S.)
           I don't like unannounced visits.

                          JACOB
           United Bancorp is going under. Wells
           Fargo has stepped up but the offer is
           insanely low.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           I know all this.

                          JACOB
           You still have the fund and you still
           have the leverage that comes with it.
           You want out of the game... buy a
           bank.
          Bretton skeptically regards Jacob.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Why are you doing this?

                          JACOB
           Because I got you into those insurance
           companies... because I let you down...
          And Bretton... biting his lip in thought...

                          BRETTON WOODS
           I don't like the mortgage toxic waste.
           It can't be quantified... and it
           spreads...

                          JACOB
           I worked it out already. You wouldn't
           have to take it.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           How'd you do that?

                          JACOB
           Well, Wells won't insure the Zabel
           institutional money. It's against
           their policy.
          And then...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           I told them you would.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Then who would take on the mortgage
           securities?

           103.

                         

                         

                          JACOB
           Uncle Sam.
          Bretton slowly nods... taking all this in...

                          BRETTON WOODS
           So, I'd get the bank, the KZI assets
           including the institutional fund yet
           none of the mortgage securities.
          As Jacob leans forward... going in for the kill...

                          JACOB
           You could actually own the bank your
           father toiled away at his whole
           career. Think about that, Bretton.
          Bretton just shakes his head.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           We're going to lose our credit. I'm
           facing margin calls.

                          JACOB
           So in order to stay in the game... we
           need fresh money.
          Bretton nods...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

                          OLEG--

                          BRETTON WOODS
           (not going to work)
           Oil's crashing.
          Jacob thinks for a moment, then...

                          JACOB
           And how much do we need?

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Fifty, sixty million minimum... and
           that's just to hold off the current
           margin calls.
          And Bretton just sighs...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           God, de-leveraging is a bitch.
          Standing...

                          JACOB
           Sit tight. I'm going to get us the
           money.
          And Jacob goes... Bretton calling out after him...

           104.

                         

                         

                          BRETTON WOODS
           From who... ?

          EXT. UNION SQUARE BORDERS BOOKS - DAY

          "Moral Hazard! Why Wall Street Has Finally Gone Too Far" is
          now everywhere.
          In large cut outs and piles on tables and in the store's
          windows.
          Jacob arrives at the end of the line... New York's newest
          best selling author is having a book signing.

          AND GORDON GEKKO
          Signs a book and looks up at the LADY who gave it to him.

                          LADY
           I have a question... what exactly is
           "moral hazard?"
          With a smile...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Short version -- taking risks you're
           not accountable for with other
           people's money.
          And the next person steps up and hands Gordon a copy.

                          JACOB
           He's going for it. We're almost home.
          As he signs it...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           There you go.

                          JACOB
           But he needs fresh money to serve the
           leverage. A hundred million.
          Gordon just shrugs.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           I'm a writer now. We don't make that
           much.
          As the line of people holding their new books start to get
          impatient...

                          JACOB
           I know that, but I figured you might
           know how to get it.
          Handing Jacob back the signed copy...

           105.

                         

                         

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Well, if you need money that badly,
           Jake... you might want to check closer
           to home.
          Off Jacob's confused reaction...

          EXT. THE MALL/WASHINGTON DC - DAY

          As they walk the mall... the Nation's Capitol behind them...

                          WINNIE
           It's a lot.

                          JACOB
           How much?

                          WINNIE
           I don't know, Jacob. I never really
           considered it mine.

                          JACOB
           But it is... right? It's your money?
          And she faces him... regarding his urgency...

                          WINNIE
           (glaring at him)
           You might want to wipe some of the
           drool off your face...

                          JACOB
           I'm not kidding. This is important.
          As they continue to walk...

                          WINNIE
           Yes, it's mine. When he went to
           prison, my father put a lot of money
           in our names. And when Rudy died it
           all became mine.

                          (BEAT)
           But it's in a trust. I can't get to
           it until I'm thirty-five and even then
           I was planning on giving it to
           charity.

                          JACOB
           Let's say I can figure out a way for
           you to get it. Take a loan against it
           -- something like that. Will you do
           that for me?

                          WINNIE
           Why are you doing this, Jacob?
          Jacob takes a moment... looking away with...

           106.

                         

                         

                          JACOB
           This is my only chance to make things
           right, Winnie.
          And she just regards him... not sure...

          INT. MILBANK,TWEED,HADLEY & MCCLOY LAW OFFICES - DAY

          As Jacob walks down the hall with KEN HADLEY, estate lawyer
          to Manhattan's elite.

                          HADLEY
           Gordon couldn't invest any of his
           money so he put most of it into the
           children's names with directions on
           how it was to be invested.

                          (BEAT)
           He definitely knew what he was
           doing...

                          JACOB
           And how could Winnie get it now?
          Hadley stops walking and thinks about it.

                          HADLEY
           Well, she'd have to sign a reversion
           of trust document. That way the funds
           would revert back to their pre-trust
           posture and regulations.

                          JACOB
           So all she has to do is sign a piece
           of paper?

                          HADLEY
           Basically.
          As that registers...

                          JACOB
           How much is in there?

                          HADLEY
           It's complicated. There's private
           equity ownership, real estate, a very
           large position in a bank... all sorts
           of investment vehicles.

                          JACOB
           Ballpark it for me.

                          HADLEY
           I don't know. Assuming immediate
           liquidity... over three hundred
           million.
          And with that, Jacob sets to go. But...

           107.

                         

                         

                          HADLEY (CONT'D)
           Of course... Gordon would have to sign
           the document as well.

          AND GORDON GEKKO
          In the make-up chair of the Fox Business channel green room,
          speaks into his phone.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           You also would need the trust's
           executor to sign it.

          INTERCUT WITH...
          Jacob as he walks down 5th avenue...

                          JACOB
           Who is that?

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Sammy Redding. He's a lifelong
           friend. It won't be a problem.

                          JACOB
           What about you?

                          GORDON GEKKO
           I would love to sign it, Jacob.
           Consider it done.
          Walking down 5th avenue...

                          JACOB
           Thank you. Thank you, Gordon.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Just after you agree to two things.

                          JACOB
           Anything.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Before Bretton buys the bank, he must
           use all of Winnie's money and all the
           Locust Fund's leverage to go against
           the market. They're about to pass
           this bailout and I want to be on the
           other side of it.

                          (BEAT)
           This thing's going to hell in a bucket
           and I'm sick of being on sidelines,
           Pal.

                          JACOB
           But what about--

                          GORDON GEKKO
           It's just for a few weeks then it's
           right back to our plan.

           108.

                         

                         
          Accepting that...

                          JACOB
           Okay.

                          (AND THEN)
           What's the second thing... ?
          And as that hangs...

                         WINNIE GEKKO
          As she starts to sign the forms... we're in...

          INT. MILBANK, TWEED, HADLEY & MCCLOY/CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          Silence. A clock ticks. A large table. Three LAWYERS sit
          on one side. Winnie and Jacob on the other and Gordon at the
          head.
          Winnie finishes signing the forms then slides them back to
          Hadley who hands them to Gordon.
          Jacob takes her hand but she pulls it away.
          And after Gordon signs the papers, they all stand.
          Gordon just looks at Winnie, who's now looking back at him.
          Tears beginning to well.
          And he slowly opens his arms...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Winnie... come here... you're all I
           have left now.
          And she slowly walks over to him... to his embrace...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           He was my only son. And I messed that
           up. I messed it all up, I know that.
          She's now crying.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           But please... forgive me...
          And confirming through her tears...

                          WINNIE
           You always get what you want, Dad.
          And Jacob Moore... witnessing this strange reunion...
          realizing how right she is...

          INT. JACOB'S OFFICE - DAY

          Jacob's on the phone in his office, watching coverage of a
          vote on the Senate floor...

           109.

                         

                         

                          JACOB
           (into his phone)
           Okay, it looks like this bailout's
           going to pass...

          SPLIT THE SCREEN
          Robby, with a phone to his ear...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           (into his phone)
           ... there's going to be an initial
           bounce...

          SPLIT THE SCREEN AGAIN... AND AGAIN... AND AGAIN...
          Each time to another broker with a phone to their ear... our
          six brokers from before...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           (into his phone)
           We're going to sell that bounce.

          AND THEN FOX BUSINESS NEWS COVERAGE
          Day by day... Alexis Glick starting off the day's coverage.
          And each new day finds Alexis in a different outfit with a
          different headline above her head.
          We don't hear her, it moves quickly and it's ugly.

          "BAILOUT PASSED -- MARKET RALLIES"

           JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           First we're going to unload all of our
           positions in the insurers.

          "DOW REVERSES COURSE TRADES BELOW 10,000"

           JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Then we're going to go the other
           way... we're going to bet against this
           market... aggressively.

           JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           ... the brokerages that are still

          As a circle forms on October 10th then travels the trend line
          down even further to late October and stops.

           JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Gentlemen, anything that can be
           sold... we're going to sell.
          And as a circle is formed around the date of October 27th,
          we...

                          CUT TO:

          INT. 533 THIRD AVENUE/LOBBY- MORNING

          Jacob gets off the elevator and sees Diego who doesn't say
          anything.

                          JACOB
           What? No market joke today?
          Diego just shrugs...

                          DIEGO
           It stopped being funny.
          Jacob softly nods and heads on his way.

          INT. JACOB'S OFFICE - DAY

          Jacob heads in to find Bretton waiting for him.

                          JACOB
           I thought you were in London.
          Jacob nods.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           The United Bancorp deal is going to go
           through. I've begun unwinding all our
           positions.

                          JACOB
           But our deal with Gordon was that we
           have to stay short until November 5th.
          Bretton just looks at him.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           What?

           111.

                         

                         

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Jacob, Gordon redeemed all his money
           yesterday. We're clean with him.
          And this hits Jacob like a ton of bricks...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           Is something wrong?

                          JACOB
           No. No, everything's great.
          Forcing out a smile...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           Let's go buy a bank.

          INT. 655 PARK AVENUE/HALLWAY - NIGHT

          As the LANDLORD walks down the hall with Jacob and Winnie.

                          JACOB
           Thank you, he hasn't answered his
           phone and we're very worried.
          The landlord nods and unlocks the apartment door for them...

          INT. GEKKO'S APARTMENT - DAY

          And they walk in to find the place completely empty.
          Everything's gone save for one thing... that framed picture
          of the woman filling her stove with money.
          Jacob slowly walks over to the it and stares it down...

                          JACOB
           He played me...
          She joins his side...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           He played us.

                          WINNIE
           I don't give a shit about the money.
          And she turns to face him.

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)
           This is who he is.
          He sucks in a deep breath, then...

                          JACOB
           I lied to you. I contacted him. I
           spent time with him. Without you
           knowing.

           112.

                         

                         

                          WINNIE
           I knew.

                          JACOB
           You knew?

                          WINNIE
           I saw the picture in your wallet.

                          JACOB
           Then why didn't you say anything?

                          WINNIE
           Because I wanted to give you a chance
           to say something first.

                          (BEAT)
           Because I love you, I really do.
          She takes off the "fuck you" ring...

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)
           And because I desperately wanted to
           find something in you to believe in.
           (shaking her head in

                          DISAPPOINTMENT)
           But Jacob... you've become that exact
           thing I've been trying to master...
          ... and places it into his palm.

                          WINNIE (CONT'D)
           ... you've become him.

          INT. MILBANK, TWEED, HADLEY & MCCLOY OFFICES - MORNING

          Hadley sits behind his desk.

                          HADLEY
           It's completely legal, Jacob. The
           funds reverted back to the pre-trust
           posture... that means the money was
           technically Gordon's again.
          Hadley just shrugs...

                          JACOB
           But he's not allowed to trade.

                          HADLEY
           He didn't trade.

                          JACOB
           He put the money into the hedge fund,
           that's considered capital investment.

                          HADLEY
           Jacob, Gordon never put the money into
           a hedge fund. He simply took control
           of the bank.

           113.

                         

                         

                          JACOB
           Bank? What bank?

                          HADLEY
           Hudson River. I told you about the
           position in the bank.
          Jacob's stunned...

                          JACOB
           Hudson River... ? I don't understand.

          SLAM INTO/BUCHANAN NEW YORK
          A sleepy town...

           HADLEY (V.O.)
           Well, Gordon had placed his Hudson
           River shares into the trust before he
           was convicted. You do know he started
           out there?
          A rental car parks out front of a small bank. Jacob emerges
          and heads for the bank...

           HADLEY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Okay, then the trust aggressively
           acquired more shares about two years
           ago... enough to have a controlling
           position in the bank.
          And Jacob stops walking when he sees... a group of angry
          depositors forming outside and a sign hanging in the
          doorway... "Closed."

          AND RIGHT BACK TO
          Jacob and Hadley...

                          JACOB
           But how? Gordon wasn't allowed to
           control the trust.

                          HADLEY
           That's right. All of the trust's
           moves were made by its executor.

                          JACOB
           Sammy Redding?
          Confused...

                          HADLEY
           Sammy Redding? Who the hell is Sammy
           Redding?

                          (BEAT)
           Jacob, the executor of Winnie's trust
           has always been Bretton Woods.
          And as that slams into Jacob Moore...

           114.

                         

                         

          INT. BOEING 767 - NIGHT

          As Jacob takes his seat and settles in for the long flight.
          He's flying commercial... and in coach.

          EXT. LONDON - DAY

          It's raining and gray.

          INT. REDMAYNE AND BENTLEY BROKERAGE - DAY

          As Jacob walks the hallowed halls of this old school stock
          brokerage with the MANAGER...

                          JACOB
           So we're throwing Bretton's birthday
           party at Balmoral.

                          MANAGER
           Well, we're very proud to have such a
           resounding success hail from these
           hallowed halls I assure you.

                          (BEAT)
           We've been trying to get Bretton to
           come back and speak to our younger
           brokers, but... he's a hard man to
           reach.

                          JACOB
           That's funny because he often speaks
           about his days here at Redmayne and
           Bentley... anyway, what I'm hoping you
           can help me with were records of his
           early trades. Years ago.

                          (BEAT)
           We think it'll be fun to bring up some
           of Bretton's real losers from when he
           was starting out... you know we all
           have dogs.

                          MANAGER
           Of course... but it is against policy
           to allow just anyone to see those
           records.

                          JACOB
           I completely understand. How about
           this? I'll make you a trade.

                          (BEAT)
           You let me see the records for
           Bretton's party...
          And with a killer smile...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           ... and I'll make sure Bretton gives
           your young brokers a speech that will
           blow them away.

           115.

                         

                         

          INT. REDMAYNE AND BENTLEY BROKERAGE/RECORDS HALL - LATER

          As Jacob looks over the old documents... trading ledgers from
          twenty-five years ago.
          Down the list we see him circle all the unusually large
          successful trades. And then follow them to the client # on
          the right side of the ledger.
          And Jacob realizes it's the same client # every time. Client

          #41.

                          JACOB
           Wow, Bretton -- you really kicked some
           ass for client forty one.
          Finally Jacob turns to the back of the ledger, to the client
          key, where he moves the pencil down to client #41 and it
          says... Gordon Gekko.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           (all making sense now)
           Bud Fox wasn't the only one.

          INT. IMPRESSIVE TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

          Jacob waits in the large entry hall... holding a cheap
          umbrella he bought at Heathrow.
          And down from the stairs walks...

                          OLEG
           It's been a bitch of a month, my
           friend... tell me this visit does not
           bring bad news.

          INT. OLEG'S LIBRARY - NIGHT

          Oleg sips his vodka and looks at Jacob.

                          OLEG
           You want me to audit The Locust Fund?

                          JACOB
           That's right. I want you to tell
           Bretton you need the official records
           of all the fund's activity starting
           with when you gave him the original
           two hundred million. You need this
           because The Russian Federal Tax
           Service is up your ass and you have to
           play ball with them.

                          OLEG
           And if he declines... ?

                          JACOB
           You'll have no choice but to pull your
           money.

           116.

                         

                         
          Oleg lights a cigarette... exhaling the smoke with...

                          OLEG
           And why would I do that?
          And Jacob leans forward...

                          JACOB
           Because if you do this for me, Oleg,
           I'll teach you the Andrew Zabel magic.
           I'll explain to you, in detail, all of
           his techniques... I'll give you all
           his secrets... it's less complicated
           than you might think.

          INT. LONDON MOTEL ROOM - DAY

          Darkness, until... a phone rings. Jacob wakes up and takes
          it.

                          JACOB
           Hello... Okay, thank you.
          He moves to the curtains then opens them.
          And the daylight spills in.

          INT. OLEG'S LIBRARY - DAY

          Oleg slides four encyclopedia-sized bounded stacks of
          printouts across his desk.

                          OLEG
           All the Locust Fund's trades for the
           last two years.
          Jacob nods, placing them into his bag.
          And Oleg lights a cigarette... looks right at us...
          excited... leaning forward with...

                          OLEG (CONT'D)
           Now give it to me. Let me behind the
           Andrew Zabel curtain...

          INT. 767 - DAY

          As Jacob flies back to New York. He flips through the Locust
          Fund trading ledgers, shaking his head in disbelief.

          INT. WINNIE'S APARTMENT - MORNING

          Winnie answers the door to find...

                          JACOB
           They were working together. Your
           father and Bretton.
          Walking back into the apartment...

           117.

                         

                         

                          WINNIE
           Jacob, what are you doing here?
          Following her in...

                          JACOB
           Gordon wanted the trust the whole
           time. And when I came to him seeking
           revenge... he saw his window.
          Upset, she looks for her keys.

                          WINNIE
           I have to go to work.

                          JACOB
           Bretton owed him a favor because he
           fed your father information twenty
           three years ago when he was a young
           broker in London and your father never
           ratted him out.
          She just looks at him... shaking her head... and not in
          disapproval... but in pity. But he keeps going.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           And he never put the money into
           Bretton's fund. Turns out your trust
           had built up a controlling position in
           Hudson River Bank.

                          WINNIE
           That's the bank he worked at when I
           was born.

                          JACOB
           Well, now he owns it. Or shall I say
           pilfered it before he went AWOL.

                          (BEAT)
           And that money wasn't even the
           bank's... it was taxpayers'... bailout
           money.
          As this washes over a stunned Winnie Gekko...

                          WINNIE
           Jesus...
          And Jacob confirms...

                          JACOB
           He saw this coming years ago... from
           his cell. I'm guessing he made off
           with billions.
          And he throws something on the table.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           And now look?

           118.

                         

                         
          It's a copy of Portfolio Magazine with a picture of Gordon on
          cover under the headline... "Guess Who's Back and Getting
          Rich Betting Against You?"

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           He's in London... giving interviews
           and being hailed as a genius.
           Everyone's buying his book and waiting
           to see his next move.
          Desperately trying to get her mind around this...

                          WINNIE
           But what about the SEC, the regulatory
           agencies-- ?

                          JACOB
           The government is flying this 700
           billion dollar airplane by the seat of
           it's pants. They don't know where
           half of the fucking money is going.
           And even if they did, do you think
           they want this out there?
          As this all washes over her...

                          WINNIE
           This is his revenge.

                          JACOB
           Yup... sure beats the hell out of
           insider trading, doesn't it?
          And Winnie finds her keys and heads for the door...

                          WINNIE
           I can't hear anymore of this.
          ... but Jacob steps in front of her.

                          JACOB
           I'm done. I sold everything. The
           ring. Everything. I gave back the
           KZI bonus. I'm out and I'm broke and
           I deserve it.
          And she just looks at him...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           But Winnie, the one thing I can't
           accept -- is losing you.
          And before she reacts...

          WERE BACK ON THE CHART
          As a circle forms on Nov 6th then travels quite a ways then
          finally stops. Unfortunately, this slope down the S&P
          trendline is quite pronounced.

           119.

                         

                         
          And as a circle is formed around Jan 24th 2009, we...

                          CUT TO:

          THE CABIN OF A BOEING 777
          As Jacob opens up a copy of Barron's... Gekko on the cover
          under the caption "What's His Next Move?"

          AND BRETTON WOODS
          In an official office of our Federal Reserve Bank, proudly
          signing the documents...

          AND ALONG THE BANKS OF THE PERSIAN GULF
          Dubai in the background. Jacob waits against a bench.
          And across the way he sees... approaching him... Gordon
          Gekko.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Did you see Barrons?

                          JACOB
           You finally got the cover.
          Gordon nods.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           Everybody thinks you got rich of
           betting against the system. If they
           only knew...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           The powers that be will never let that
           happen.
          Jacob's not arguing it...

                          JACOB
           How much is enough, Gordon?
          Gordon laughs with a shake of the head.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           I've been asked that before...

                          (AND THEN)
           They took a hundred, twenty two
           thousand, six hundred and forty hours
           from me... for a goddamn victimless
           crime. All the while I sit in my 8 by
           12 and watch real crooks by the
           thousands give out mortgages like
           candy, package them into unexplainable
           derivatives and spit the cancer out
           into the world.
          And he just shakes his head...

           120.

                         

                         

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           And when I get out... who's there
           waiting for me? Nobody.

                          (BEAT)
           You better believe I'm going to get
           mine.

                          JACOB
           You're not going to miss America?

                          GORDON GEKKO
           I'll always have America... it's why
           I'm here. I'm buying the island.

                          (BEAT)
           I know it's kitschy but it's fun and
           good for business.
          Looking over the water...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           I have a lot business abroad now.
           Interests in an Australian copper
           mine, a German solar company, some
           Russian oil pipelines, a casino in
           Macau... see Jake, America just isn't
           where the action is anymore.

                          JACOB
           What happened to the precious
           depreciating asset of time?

                          GORDON GEKKO
           It still trades...
          And he turns to Jacob with a smile...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           ... but I'm a billionaire now, Pal.

                          JACOB
           I'm out, Gordon, I'm done trading.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           I don't know why. You pulled it off,
           Kid, you took him down -- granted with
           my help -- but you atoned for Zabel's
           sins with Bretton's money.

                          (BEAT)
           As I see it, you're just getting
           started.
          And Jacob stops walking then slowly turns to Gordon with...

                          JACOB
           Did you ever really want to reconcile
           with her?

                          GORDON GEKKO
           (of course I did)
           I'm human.

           121.

                         

                         
          Glaring at him...

                          JACOB
           Then why did you do it?
          And Gordon... strongly holding Jacob's glare... simply
          replies...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Same answer.

                          JACOB
           But it didn't work.
          Gordon sadly shrugs...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           I've been trying to wire two hundred
           million into her bank account but she
           won't accept it.

                          JACOB
           I know. She doesn't want it... we
           don't want it.

                          (BEAT)
           Because it's not about what you
           have... it's about what you do. And
           Gordon -- it's never about the money.
          Gordon shakes his head.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           That sounds good. I bet you can even
           wrap it in a pretty red bow. But
           Champ, it's idealistic... and idealism
           kills every trade.

                          (BEAT)
           Winnie will realize that at some
           point... and then we'll be fine.
          And Jacob finally looks away... in pity.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           See Jacob -- the hustle we all fall
           for is actually thinking we can fight
           what's inherent, what's inevitable...
           that we can somehow undo what
           genetics, or God, or whatever name you
           wanna tag it, has placed deep inside
           of us. Because whether it's greed or
           revenge or the compulsion to chase...
           it all amounts to the same thing...
           loss of control. And it's always
           going to be there and it's always
           going to be stronger than you, Pal.
          Now walking again...

           122.

                         

                         

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           It's why bubbles will always exist and
           it's why we're all currently in this
           mess.
          Joining Gordon's stride...

                          JACOB
           Winnie's pregnant.
          And Gordon stops walking.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           It's going to be a boy.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           What do you want?

                          JACOB
           It's bad out there, Gordon, people are
           panicked. They're not looking to
           their government. They're not looking
           to their trusted advisors. They're
           looking to you.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           You want me to buy?
          And Jacob Moore... slowly confirming...

                          JACOB
           Publicly and aggressively.
          Gordon just looks at him.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           But they're all lemmings. Simple
           psychology. You once said every crash
           should have a JP Morgan to step in and
           save it.

                          (BEAT)
           Well Gordon -- this is your chance to
           be JP Morgan.
          And now Gordon shakes his head...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           We're far from the bottom. It'll be a
           dead cat bounce.

                          JACOB
           It'll buy us time. That's all I'm
           asking for... time.

                          (BEAT)
           Time for the new administration to put
           their plan into action.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           What do I get in return?

           123.

                         

                         
          As Gordon turns... takes in the city of Dubai... in all of
          its ridiculous splendor...

                          JACOB
           Full clemency.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           You can offer that?

                          JACOB
           Your daughter can. She works with the
           new Secretary of Treasury now.
          Considering that...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           What else?

                          JACOB
           Winnie. Me. Your grandson.
           Something money can't buy... a family.
          And Gordon looks at him for the longest moments, allowing it
          all to register, then...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Sorry son -- that's simply a trade I
           cannot make.
          And as Gordon Gekko walks off... leaving Jacob Moore
          behind...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           You wanna know what the mother of all
           bubbles was? Us. The human race.
           Scientists call it the Cambrian
           Explosion, from the Cambrian fauna.

          AND RONALD REAGAN NATIONAL AIRPORT
          As Jacob heads into the baggage claim area to see Winnie
          waiting for him...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           It happened 530 million years ago...
           when all of the sudden, there was the
           seemingly rapid appearance of most
           major groups of complex animals.
          And as they embrace...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           And from it was born humanity.

          AND GORDON GEKKO
          Being led through a massive empty space... office space...

           124.

                         

                         

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           It was an explosion of life.
           Scientists will tell you it was
           unprecedented, excessive and by the
           standards of evolution-time...
           happened in a flash.
          The City of London outside the large windows...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           Suddenly the world had millions of new
           species... just like that.
          This will be the home of his new international empire.

          AND BRETTON WOODS
          At his desk in his 15 CPW penthouse...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           See -- bubbles are the purest form of
           Darwinism.
          ... looking over pages and pages of destruction... Andrew
          Zabel's legacy that he now has to pay for...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           They teach us what we didn't know and
           they remind us of what we forgot...
          And Bretton completely loses it... just starts ripping out
          the pages then tearing them in two...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           They kill excess and they lean out the
           herd.
          ... methodically... page by page... over and over again...

          AND GORDON GEKKO
          Sitting in his massive London office.
          It's empty. It's night. He's completely alone.
          He looks up at the wall... at the framed picture of JP Morgan
          and Uncle Sam rowing that boat.
          Then he looks down at an old picture of Winnie... she's
          probably three or four years old... and lovingly holding her
          baby brother, Rudy.

          And Gordon holds on this picture for a long moment, before
          finally...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           They actually bring us back to the
           necessary simple...

           125.

                         

                         
          ... picking up the phone.

          AND GORDON GEKKO
          Now in the back of a Town Car... we don't know where...

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Because Jacob...
          As the door opens, daylight spills in and we see the charging
          bull of Bowling Green Park across the way...
          Gordon is escorted out of the car and led to the doors of the
          New York stock exchange.
          And Gordon stops at the famed doors, takes a moment to regard
          the exchange, sucks in a deep breath, readies for his hero's
          welcome and finally... opens the doors then disappears
          inside.

          AND WINNIE AND JACOB
          Greet the morning in their small Washington DC apartment.
          Winnie pouring coffee, Jacob turning on the TV.
          And on the screen is a picture of Gordon Gekko walking the
          floor of the New York stock exchange under the graphic...
          "Gekko Now Betting On A Recovery."

           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           ... you'd be amazed what can rise from
           the ashes.

          Sam Cooke's "A Change Is Gonna Come" kicks in.
          And we go close on the Fox Business Channel's coverage of the
          market's huge rally of an opening... with Gordon Gekko
          ringing the bell... until the channel suddenly changes... to
          the cartoon network... while we...

           FADE OUT.
