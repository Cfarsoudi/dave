              EXT. JUNGLE VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS

              A relatively modern village... for a remote jungle. Dawn is
              JUST barely beginning to break. The morning mist persists as
              we see FOUR FEDERALES with machine guns surrounding a group
              of VILLAGERS.

              O
               N GROUND - A WOMAN VILLAGER is thrown down. Her SON, 8, runs

          1
              to her side. She's mad. Her son cries.

          

                                                                          2.

          

          

          

                                  WOMAN VILLAGER
                        You monsters!
              UP ANGLE - As we see the THREE FEDERALES, greasy men, holding
              AK-47's, and looking down with hardened indifference. OS, we
              hear an EVIL CHUCKLE. The men part as we see-
              - COL. PANTERA. A bottom-heavy disgusting pig of a man walks
              up between them. Pantera leans down, face to face with her.

                                  PANTERA
                        We appreciate the generous donation
                        for the continued protection of
                        your village.
              ANGLE ON - Their jeep, overflowing with the Village's
              precious crops.
              WIDER - A tiny group (10) of other villagers stand at a safe
              distance. The Woman's HUSBAND runs forward. He immediately
              LUNGES at Pantera, just as-
              -SHIKA-SHIKA - Pantera is flanked by 3 MACHINE GUNS pointed
              at the Husband's chest. Pantera slothfully grins. He leans
              forward and yanks an HEIRLOOM NECKLACE from her neck.

                                  PANTERA
                        After all, the jungle can be a very
                        dangerous place. BAH-HAHAHAHA.
              They jump into the Jeep and tear into the jungle LAUGHING.

          

          

              EXT. JUNGLE ROAD - MOMENTS LATER


          4                                                                    4
              The jeep clamors down the bumpy makeshift path. Pantera sits
              in the passenger seat as the others are crammed in around the
              food. The Jungle looms ominous around them.

              H
               IGH ANGLE - As we watch the jeep from the jungle ceiling
              high above... as if from someone's POV.
              ON DRIVER - He suddenly reacts to a fallen tree on the road
              ahead. Slams on the brakes. Pantera is thrown around.

                                  PANTERA
                        Idiota! Watch where you're going!

                                  DRIVER SOLIDER
                        There's a log on the road, senor.
                            (quietly to himself)
                        ...that wasn't there an hour ago.

                                   PANTERA
                        Well, what are you waiting for?!

                        REMOVE IT!
                            (to soldiers behind)
                        Cortez! Andelay!

          CORTEZ leaps out. Grabs the winch from the front of the jeep
          and pulls it to the log, roughly 15 feet away.
           EEP POV - Pantera and Driver barely notice the out-of-focus
          bg Cortez get suddenly YANKED out of scene!

                               CORTEZ (O.S.)
                    ...yirk!
          ON DRIVER - His eyes go wide. Trying to see in the dark.

                              DRIVER SOLIDER
                        (softly, nervous)
                    D-d-dios mio.
          ON LOG - Cortez is gone. Pantera wakes up.

                              PANTERA
                    What?! WHAT IS IT?!
          OS - Hear the sound of a CHAIN clinking. Then WHOOSHING as
          the chain winch suddenly FLIES IN, and CRACKS the BURLY
          SOLDIER across the jaw! It wraps itself around his neck.
          Before he can react...
          - YOINK! He gets pulled over the hood of the jeep, landing on
          the ground HARD.

                                URLY SOLDIER

                    OOF!
          Burly gets pulled backward... away from the Jeep and into...
          the darkness. He SCREAMS the entire way, clawing the ground.
          ON JEEP - Driver is freaking out now. Last Soldier is in the
          back. Pantera stands up in the jeep. "Last" jumps out and
          readies his machine gun.

                              PANTERA
                        (to Jungle)

                    WHO ARE YOU?! SHOW YOURSELF!!

                        (WHISPER)
                    ...The Ghost of the Jungle.

                               PANTERA
                    What?!

                              DRIVER SOLDIER

                           (
                         shaking/nervous)
                    The jungle god that punishes those
                    who prey upon the weak.
                        (looks scared to Pantera)
                    He's coming... for us.

              OS NOISE - Suddenly hear the whooshing of 4 quick punches,
              kicks, a short machine gun burst and a WHUMP. Pantera and
              Driver look to the ground.
              ON GROUND - Last Soldier lays beaten on the jungle floor.

                                  DRIVER SOLIDER
                        I'm sorry, senor.
              Driver bounds out of the Jeep and runs SCREAMING into the
              jungle. CAM PULLS BACK with him as Pantera shrinks in bg.

                                  PANTERA

                        COWARD!! GET BACK HERE!!
              Something suddenly skitters behind Pantera! He turns to look.
              Nothing. He reaches down and pulls up... a MACHETE.

                                  PANTERA

                        SHOW YOURSELF! DO YOU REALIZE WHO

                        YOU'RE DEALING WITH?!
              ON PANTERA - He circles backs against the Jungle wall, trying
              to find him. Tense. Suddenly-
              -a PAIR OF WHITE EYES open in the blackness behind him!
               n a quick series of shots we see Pantera getting the raw end
              of a flurry of fist and foot attacks. His attacker is moving
              way too fast for the camera to keep up.
              Pantera falls back, panting heavily. Panicked. He tears off
              into the dense Jungle!
              ON PANTERA RUNNING THROUGH JUNGLE - Thick foliage. Panicked.

              An oasis of calm, violated by this sweating, machete-
              clutching brute. He stumbles, then stands in the middle.

                                    ANTERA
                        I am not afraid of a myth!
                            (eyes darting)

                        Actually... it's "Turtle", pal.
              Pantera swings around. Eyes wide.
               N ATTACKER - We pan up the thick green legs. Muscular and
              strong. Further up. Arms to match. Rough skin. It wears a
              shorn HOODED PONCHO. Inside are two white eyes and gritted
              smiling teeth.
              The poncho falls to the ground.

          

                                                                       5.

          

          

          
              ON ATTACKER - It's LEONARDO! Beaten blue bandana blowing in
              the breeze. Total hero shot. He pulls out a SINGLE KATANA
              SWORD, poised for battle. Pantera's backed into a corner.

                                  PANTERA
                        Let's see if a ghost can die, then.
              Pantera SCREAMS and runs to Leo and starts swinging! At the
              CLASH of sword and machete, we-

              EXT. JUNGLE VILLAGE - MOMENTS LATER

              The Boy is still at the Village Clearing. Suddenly -
              - the sound of the JEEP begins to rumble in the distance! The
              villagers panic and scatter. VROOM! The Jeep flies out of the
              jungle and bounce-slows into the FG!
              Only there is no one driving it... and it still has the
              stolen food in it. And the stolen medallion dangles from the
              rear view mirror.

                                  WOMAN VILLAGER
                        It's a miracle!
              The village rejoices. The Boy steps aside for a beat, looks
              back at the Jungle. Something catches his eye.
              ...a small crouched figure on a tree branch. Barely
              silhouetted. His white eyes lit in the darkness. One of them
              WINKS as the boy smiles.

              Leo leaps into frame. He takes out his katanas and lays them
              carefully on the ground. He KNEELS, head bowed, eyes closed.

              The music is in full tilt as the camera travels through
              seemingly miles of underground pipes of all types and design.
               he camera comes to the end of line. It rises up through
          9   STEAM... then through a metal grate, as we find ourselves in-

          

          

              EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - NIGHT                             9

              A mouse-level shot of the spectacular city that never sleeps.
              It's oddly hypnotic. Still. Until...
              - BAM! A pair of sneakers land barely in front of the camera,
              tearing off into the distance.

                                  NYPD #1 (O.S.)

                        FREEEZE! STOP OR WE'LL SHOOT!
              Shoes belong to a panicked MUGGER, early 20's, as THREE NYPD
              OFFICERS clamor after him. The Mugger is a jackrabbit -
              hopping newspaper machines, rolling under passing trucks and
              doing anything he can to avoid arrest.
               ventually the NYPD peter out. The mugger looks back. Smiles.

                                  MUGGER
                        Heh, heh... suckers.
              ON MUGGER - His eyes suddenly go wide as - VROOOOOM! - we see
              a jet-black tweaked out motorcycle fly over the cops' heads,
              aiming directly for Mugger!

                                   MUGGER
                        Whaaa!!!
              The Mugger runs, but can't escape. The Driver is dressed in
              all-black motorcycle leathers and black-visored helmet. Scary
              and faceless. He quickly gains on the Mugger and GRABS him by
              the collar in mid-stride!

                                  MUGGER
                        You crazy?! Put me down, man!
              But Driver doesn't. Instead, he holds him lower without
              stopping the bike... and proceeds to plow Mugger's head into
              every trash can and garbage bin along 9th Avenue!

                                  MUGGER

                        OW! HEY! WHAT'RE YOU-OW!! OOF!
              Just as it looks like he'll hit a telephone pole... Driver
              veers left! He drags the Mugger into...

               EXT. DEAD END ALLEYWAY - CONTINUOUS

               Driver tosses him onto the ground at full speed. Mugger
               SLIDES down the alley and collides with a pile of garbage
               like he's a human bowling ball.
               ON HEAD OF ALLEY - The Driver guns the bike and kicks up a
               ton of dust and racket, peeling donuts at mouth of the alley.
               And then he stops. Dust slowly settles and smoke dissipates.

                                   MUGGER
                         Wh-wh-what kinda freak are you?!
               The Driver gets off the bike. Silence. Backlit by headlight.
               He walks directly to the Mugger with purpose. Mugger starts
               to really freak out. Driver picks him up by the collar and
               SLAMS him to the back WOODEN FENCE WALL.

                                   MUGGER
                         P-p-please. Don't kill me, man.
               Driver just cocks his head. Mugger can see his own terrified
               reflection his Driver's black visor. Driver reaches behind
               his back and pulls out a COMBAT KNIFE! He reels back and...

                                   MUGGER
                         Wh-wha-wha-WHAT ARE YOU DOI- AAAGH!

               W
                HAM! - Driver nails the dagger through the Mugger's JACKET,
               PINNING HIM TO THE WALL. Driver turns around to gather the
               purse's belongings at the mouth of the alley.
                fter he stops cringing, the Mugger wriggles the blade out of
               the wall. Driver doesn't notice as - THWIP-IP-IP! - he hurls
               the knife at the Driver!
               THUNK! It sticks in the DRIVER'S BACK!
                N MUGGER - His grinning eyes suddenly GO WIDE as Driver
               slowly turns around, UNHURT! The Mugger is trapped as Driver
               moves toward him... and a BOLO CHAIN drops to his side.
               ON WALL SHADOW - as we see a flurry of punches, kicks and
               throws as Driver lays a beating on the criminal who needs to
               be taught a lesson. An OS Police Siren chirps.
               MOUTH OF ALLEY - The police suddenly show up, cherries
               flashing. They run to FG, mouths drop.

                                    NYPD #1

               ON MUGGER - Hung upside down by a chain. Purse hangs from his
               neck. He'll live, but never commit another crime again...

               WIDER - A quieter area of the city. Broken by the squealing
               of the bike as Driver (Nightwatcher) roars in to a stop.
               Nightwatcher drives underneath a TRAIN BRIDGE. He takes off
               his helmet. Red cloth spills out. He turns around as we see-

               - RAPHAEL, THE RED-MASKED NINJA TURTLE!
               He reaches back and pulls out the KNIFE from his SHELL. Looks
               at it, shaking his head and grinning. He sheathes it.

                                    R

               QUICK SHOTS - Ignites and revs engine. Straps helmet back on.
               Headlight comes to life. Lets the clutch out.
               VROOOOM! - CAM STARTS TIGHT ON bike as Raphael tears away.

                         Dude... I'm scared!

               CLOSE ON - A PAIR OF TURTLE EYES... MICHAELANGELO'S! They're
               wide with FEAR. Nervously darting around, unable to keep up
               with the surrounding danger.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Dude! They're all around me! What
                         do I do? WHAT DO I DO?!
               Mikey's eyes continue to panic. DONATELLO's voice comes in
               over a RADIO. Calming.

                                   DONATELLO (O.S.)

               INT. UPTOWN APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

               The cam pulls out of a LARGE MASCOT HEAD - looks like a big
               goofy Turtle head with googly eyes and dumb smile. WIDER we
               see a fake ZIPPER spirit-glued onto Mikey's plastron. In his
               hands, he holds two nerf-styled NUNCHUCKS.

                                   MICHAELANGELO

                         Okay - waita-WHOA-WHOA-WHOA-WHOA!!
               Suddenly TEN KIDS WITH BIRTHDAY HATS AND FOAM NUNCHUCKS run
               in SCREAMING and start beating on Mikey... a little too hard.

                                   SCREAMING KIDS
                         Get him! Yeah! You suck! Hey!
                         Awright! Take that, Turtle-dork!

               End WIDER with the kids all walking away from Mikey, now on
               the floor doubled over from the "playing". A beat, then-
               -one more kid runs back and kicks Mikey.

                         as the rugrats you got here.
               ON KIDS - They look tough, brandishing their nerf weapons - a
               toddler street gang. One of the kids does a finger-point-then-
               throat-slit gesture. The mom looks and beams. The kids
               quickly smile to cover.

               Mikey looks to the side, and sees the still piled-high stack
               of PIZZA BOXES through the fake head POV.

               Mikey opens the van's rear doors. He PULLS OFF the fake
               zipper on his chest and then pulls off his fake turtle head.
               His trademark orange bandana spills out.
               He turns, breathing in the fresh surface air. A quiet beat
               until - A POLICE SIREN approaches, faint, in the distance.
               Mikey jumps in the van, slams the door shut as the car
               whizzes by.

               light. Don monitors from a small dashboard cam. Man looks OS
               Left. Reacts.
               OFF HIS LOOK - We see Mikey beside him in the van. He's
               behind the wheel - face FROZEN in a goofy SMILE like a
               ventriloquist to "hide" his identity. Don follows on a small
               surveillance cam under the rearview mirror.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Yes... sir.

                                   DONATELLO (O.S.)
                         That's a good boy.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         All's I'm saying Donnie is that no
                         one would notice if YOU did one of
                         these gigs every now and again.

                                    DONATELLO (O.S.)
                         But you add such... panache to the
                         character.
               Mikey, emotional, pops into "fully animated" facial mode. He
               rubs his sore neck.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Well, if panache is French for
                         "punching bag", I'd have to agree
                         with ya.

               A darkened room lit only by the lights of dozens of tv's,
               monitors and TV tubes. Cables run everywhere. In front of
               them is DONATELLO - our resident tech-head turtle.

               ON MONITOR - Don watches Mikey through a TRAFFIC CAM in front

               ON CAR - The Man is still looking - only now really freaked
               out - at the fully animated Mikey head.

                                    MICHAELANGELO
                         Aw nuts.
               Mikey suddenly grips his face back into a tight SMILE,
               frozen. He looks over and waves at the man who confusingly
               waves back.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                             (ventriloquist style)
                         Just get me outta here, dude.
               ON DON - He hits some switches. Monitors change.

                         Traffic's clear eastbound for two
                         blocks. Then hook up with route J.
               BACK WITH MIKEY - He's still waving with a frozen smile.

                                    ICHAELANGELO
                             (ventriloquist style)
                         Righteous.
               Mikey immediately "unfreezes" and sticks his tongue out and
               antics at the Man! Before the man can react, Mikey TEARS OUT
               and zips across traffic down a deserted side-street.
               ...as we notice the annoying ice cream style music tinkering

                                    M
               along with his gaining speed.

               The van parks in a long-forgotten alleyway. A dummy gate
               closes behind it, obscuring it from view.
               UNDER THE VAN - We see it's parked over a manhole cover. It
               slowly slides shut.

               The dripping concrete and metal maze explodes with the
               cacophony of Mikey riding his skateboard, backpack in tow.

                                   MICHAELANGELO

                         YEEEEEHAAAAAAWWWW!!

               But this isn't just any half-pipe - it tests all of Mikey's
               skills in ninjitsu, extreme sports and cross-training. He
               jumps on and off the board to occasionally tackle obstacles
               with all four limbs. A fun rock n' roll sequence.
               Feels like Mikey is miles away from the surface world when he
               arrives at a seemingly DEAD END. He smiles as he reveals a
               BRICK DUMMY WALL that brings him to...

               Mikey lands in the "foyer" of sorts. Atop entrance stairs. He
               kicks the double doors open.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Honeeeeey! I'm hooome!
               As Mikey slides down the banister, the cam dollies around

               I
               behind him revealing the LAIR. Breathtaking to fresh eyes.
                t has a wonderful lived-in feel - they're not squatters...
               they've made this their HOME. Furniture is jury-rigged and
               the place is custom lit to provide the right kind of
               atmosphere. If we looked behind the surface detail, we'd see
               a mesh of wires and circuitry powering the entire lair.
               Donatello runs up to Mikey. Mikey robotically hands him the
               wad of money from the party.

                                   DONATELLO
                         Moneymoneymoneymoney.
               As Donnie walks away, Mikey LOUDLY CLEARS HIS THROAT. Don
               stops as Mikey holds out his hand. Don's busted - he peels
               off a few bills and hands Mikey his share.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Domo arigato, dude.
               Mikey walks into the room and plops down on a sofa. Hits a
               remote as a BIG SCREEN lights up in front of him. Suddenly-

                                   SPLINTER (O.S.)

                         MICHAELANGELO!
               Mikey springs from the couch. Snaps to obedience.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Yes, sensei.
               ANGLE ON - SPLINTER the Japanese rodent master and father of
               the TMNT. He is well-kempt, still walks with a cane, and has
               the same sparkle in his eye. He approaches Mikey. Silent.

                                   SPLINTER
                             (a beat)

                         Oh! Here ya go, Master Splinter.
               Mikey reaches into his bag and removes a foil-wrapped piece
               of BIRTHDAY CAKE. Splinter lights up.

                                   SPLINTER
                         Ahh! Butter creme frosting!
               Donatello walks to Splinter. Holds his hand out, judgmental.

                                   DONATELLO
                         Master. No cake. You remember your
                         last cholesterol tests.

                                   SPLINTER
                         But I-
                             (changes attitude)
                         -Donatello! I am your Master!

                                   DONATELLO
                         Nice try, sensei. But you can still
                         be my Master... with low
                         cholesterol.
               Splinter surrenders the cake. As Don walks away,
               Michaelangelo reaches into his bag and secretly passes
               Splinter a smaller wrapped piece.

                                   SPLINTER
                         He-heh. You have done well, my son.
               Donatello walks to the fridge and opens it - FILLED with
               dozens of other pieces of Birthday Cake leftovers. He tosses
               it with the rest.                                  C

               The street noise below is barely audible. Camera creeps along
               the edge of the building, reaching a row of GARGOYLES.

               She takes off her sunglasses and admires the crate.
               ON BOX - Labelled "O'Neil Cargo". Something ominous about the
               crate. PUSH IN on it as April steps in front. Admires it with

               Casey rubs his face, tries to orient himself. Looks at watch.

                         to you after being in a deadly
                         jungle for almost a month.

                         Forget it. I'll take a cab.
               A long pause on the phone. Casey knows he's busted.

                                   CASEY
                         I missed you?
               April doesn't answer. She closes the phone. Casey slumps in
               his chair, shaking his head.

                                   CASEY
                         Good goin', Case.
               Back at the dock, April is back to business.

                                   APRIL
                         Howie! Get this on the truck for
                         delivery! Let's go!
               P.O.V. INSIDE BOX - See April through the wood slats. We'd
               swear we almost hear... LOW GROWLING.

                                                                 CUT TO:

          

          

               INT. MIKEY'S BEDROOM - LATER


          25                                                                25
               Mikey is on his bed. His thumbs pound away at a video game on
               TV - bored. He puts down the controller and yells to the
               ceiling.

                                   MICHAELANGELO

                         I'M! BORED!!!!!
               He stands up and walks to DON'S ROOM. He opens it. It takes
               only one foot until the door is pushed up against piles of
               TECH JUNK. Mikey uses his shoulder and pushes it open.
                N DON - He's hunched over a work table, back to Mikey.
               Tinkering as always. Wild inventions line the walls, some
               finished, some not. Some pay tribute to past TMNT adventures.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Don, y'ever feel like you were
                         meant for more? To DO more? Like, I
                         mean, sometimes I feel like...

                              MICHAELANGELO(cont'd)
                    like we never really left that
                    glass turtle bowl when we were
                    little dudes.
          REVERSE ANGLE - Don lifts his head up, eyes MAGNIFIED in some
          bizarre head contraption. He flips up side panels,
          ELECTRONICA MUSIC blares out.

                               ONATELLO
                    Oh, hi Mikey. You say something?

                              MICHAELANGELO
                        (sighs - to himself)
                    Every day it's the same thing. Wake
                    up. Birthday party gig. Drive home.
                    Watch TV. Train... Rinse. Repeat.

                              DONATELLO
                    I know. Isn't it great?
          A beat. Mikey sighs, then walks back downstairs to the LIVING
          ROOM SOFA. He and the camera think he's alone, but before he
          knows it, Splinter is sitting next to him, cross legged,
          still, and sipping tea.

                              MICHAELANGELO

                    WAH!!

                              SPLINTER
                    Michaelangelo. Boredom is never an
                    indicator of your surroundings. It
                    is a reflection of your inner
                    heart. Fill yourself with
                    excitement on the inside... and
                    you'll live the most rewarding life
                    of all.
          Mikey stares at Splinter, dead pan. A beat. Then returns to
          flipping channels. He stops on a NEWS program - "NYC DIRT".

                              NYC DIRT REPORTER (O.S.)
                    And so yet again, police officials
                    are baffled at a crime of
                    retribution that can only be
                    attributed to the mysterious figure
          M         known as "The Nightwatcher".
           ikey lights up. On TV is a flashy well-coifed, know-nothing
          REPORTER. Beside him is a news photo of the tied up MUGGER
          from our second scene.

                              NYC DIRT REPORTER
                    This is the latest in a string of
                    vigilante acts that have been
                    plaguing the city for the past
                    year.

                              NYC DIRT REPORTER(cont'd)
                    Although the victims have been
                    criminals themselves, the
                    Nightwatcher's actions have been
                    identified as destructive and
                    overly-violent... verging on the
                    edge of lethal.
          ON MIKEY - Can't smile wide enough. He runs to his room,
          returns with a POLAROID CAMERA. He snaps a picture of the TV.
          He pulls it out, placing it in his NIGHTWATCHER SCRAPBOOK,
          overflowing with paper clippings and articles on the
          vigilante.

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    Now THAT'S what I'm talking about!
                    Cruising the streets, busting those
                    who hold themselves above the law.
                        (movie announcer voice)
                    But they aren't above HIS.
          Don walks in, holding an in-process invention. He looks up.

                              DONATELLO
                    Mikey, the man's practically a
                    criminal himself. Anyone who
                    operates without boundary or rule
                    of law cannot be legislated and
                    needs to be reigned in.

                              RAPHAEL (O.S.)
                    Sounds like four turtles I used ta
                    know.
          ON DOOR - Raphael walks in, his Nightwatcher costume no where
          in sight.

                               RAPHAEL
                    Whatta we talkin' about, boys?
                    Soundin' a little too egghead fer
                    my tastes.

                               PLINTER
                    Ah, Raphael. Your brothers and I
                    were just discussing the vigilante
                    Nightwatcher once again.
                        (beat - concerned)
                    Where have you been? You've been
                    spending so much time away from
                    home lately...
          Raphael's on edge from the mention of Nightwatcher already.
          His attention doesn't break from Donatello.

                              RAPHAEL

          Splinter watches the growing tension with concern.

                              DONATELLO
                    I have no problem with the
                    incarceration of those who deserve
                    it, but if someone like
                    Nightwatcher has ultimate power...
                    then who makes sure he doesn't
                    cross the line?
          Mikey picks up two NINJA BLADE RINGS, twirling them around
          aggressively in mock battle.

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    I think he's COOL.

                              DONATELLO
                    Of course you would.

                    Keeya! HATCHAAAAAA!!

                              RAPHAEL
                    Sometimes there are lines that even
                    the police can't cross. Someone has
                    to be willing to do what needs to
                    be done. And to do that, fear
                    becomes a weapon.

                              DONATELLO
                    You are such a Neanderthal.
          Raphael does the bully FAKE LUNGE at Don. Don reacts quick
          and startled, eyes wide.

                                APHAEL
                    I rest my case.

                    Raphael! If bullying is the only
                    way to argue your point, then
                    perhaps you do not have much of a
                    point to begin with.

                               APHAEL
                        (gritted teeth)
                    Yes, sensei.
                        (to Mikey)
                    And quit touchin' my stuff.
          Raph yanks the Ring Blades out of Mikey's hands and storms
          out of the room by flipping up a series of cables to the
          second floor.

          

                                                                          20.

                         That was just a startle response
                         and isn't really an indication of
                         fear!
               Raph does the "blah blah" hand gesture from above. Enters his
               room, slams the door and immediately BLASTS MUSIC...
               ...and it's some annoying pop HIP-HOP song.

                                   RAPHAEL (O.S.)

                         AAAARGH! AND STOP TOUCHING MY

                         STEREO TOO, MIKEY!!!
               Then HEAVY ROCK starts playing to drown out his family. A
               silence sits in the room as a CD flies out of Raph's room.
               Tense in the room for a bit. Don looks at the other two.

               A large JET LINER flies into the city. Lowering. The wheels

               All is peaceful in the lair. The big screen TV is the only
               light source. Mikey snores and drools on the couch, covered
               in junk food wrappers. Donnie sleeps with an "TECH HEAD"
               magazine over his face... gadget-in-process in his lap.
               ON ENTRANCE - Leo walks in and places his bag on the floor.
               The place feels different... but still feels like home.

               He tiptoes with ninjitsu precision across the floor, avoiding
               the potential noise-making mess below him. He sneaks to-

               Leo peers in cautiously. Splinter is still awake. Expecting
               him. Kneeling on the floor. Very serious.

                                    SPLINTER
                         Enter.
               Leo walks in and kneels in front of Splinter.

                         I have completed my training,

                plinter reaches out and hands Leonardo an ANCIENT MEDALLION.
               Leo is touched.
               CLOSE ON SHADOWS OUTSIDE OF ROOM - We see a pair of EYES,

                                   SPLINTER
                         I've missed you, Leonardo.

                eo hugs Splinter.

                                   LEONARDO
                         I've missed you too, father.

                                   SPLINTER
                         I'm afraid much has changed in your
                         brothers' spirits since you have
                         left. But now that you are home,
                         they will finally have the ethical
                         and warrior leadership they have
                         been lacking. The family needs you.
               ON LEO - He swallows that big pill very hard.

                                   LEONARDO
                         Heh. Yeah... I mean, yes sensei.

          ON OUTSIDE OF ROOM - Raphael walks out of the shadows. He's
          good... but not too good for Splinter. Splinter and Leo break
          and face the doorway. An awkward silence.

                                  LEONARDO

                                 RAPHAEL
                       So... congratulations.

                       Well, I'm goin' to bed.
          He leaves.
          TV ROOM - Raph walks through the room, cuffs Don on the back
          of the head, and keeps on walking.

               It was all a nightmare. We go WIDER as we take in the
               ostentatious bedroom of MAXIMILIAN WINTERS, a young mid-40's.
               Famous NYC entrepreneur.
                inters is large, handsome, built and powerful in every
               sense. His bedroom reflects it as well - large simple shapes,
               decorated with a modern-day tribal/tech appeal. This guy is
               filled with adrenaline, power and machismo.

               Rock/hip-hop music crashes in as we see Winters' morning
               workout - a combination of weaponry work (martial arts and
               others), floor routines and bag work. He takes it all very
               seriously.
               Sequence ends with him smashing the top off of a Mook Jung
               training block with his bare fist. He walks out of the room,
               grabbing a towel from a blonde assistant.

               Winters walks in his crisp suit. His office is large and
               austere. Two levels of history in books, artifacts, warrior
               themed curios and power.

               He slowly LOWERS OUT OF FRAME. CAM PULLS OUT WIDER REVEALING -
                 Winters Office is an "elevator" of sorts that can ride up
               and down the front of the building, allowing him access to
               any floor of his Tower without leaving his desk.
               WIDER - see the Tower is a monolith in the middle of
               Manhattan - complete with it's own front Central Park-ish
               gated entry. A true work of modern architecture.

               We see the wonder of everything Winters - mixing of old
               artifacts with modern day aesthetic and implementation. The

               CLOSE ON - A familiar-looking white HOCKEY MASK. Eyes blink
               behind it.

                         Yo, Case? Wanna be goalie?
               The mask is pushed aside by Casey - Kid 1 was holding it.

                                   CASEY
                         Nah, you know I work for a livin'.

          WIDER - Casey is with 5 other KIDS prepping for a game of
          STREET HOCKEY, using tennis balls and trash cans. Chubbier
          KID 2 walks by and grabs the mask himself.

                              KID 2
                    Whatever! Let's get it on!
          They begin a boisterous round of hockey. Trash talk, gentle
          checking and all the requisite boy things. We see that the
          kids love Casey. And vice versa. Suddenly-

                              BROOKLYN MOM (O.S.)

                    TOMMY!! IT'S TIME FOR DINNER!

                              TOMMY (KID 1)

                    BUT MA! WE JUST STARTED!

                        (snapping back)

                    THOMAS!
          Tommy's defeated. Looks at the disappointed boys.

                              TOMMY
                    Sorry dudes.

                              CASEY

                        (face falls, disappointed)
                    ...oh no.
          OFF HIS LOOK - We see APRIL, dressed stunning in a dark
          business suit at the other side of the street. She's dangling
          a WHITE SHIRT and a TIE from her other hand.

                               ASEY
                    Aw, c'mon April! We just started!
          April just gives him "the look" with an eyebrow cock. Casey
          knows he can't win.

                              KID 2
                    Can't Casey stay and play for just
                    five more minutes, Miss O'Neil?
                    Pleeeeeeease?

                    to pretend to be an adult for a few
                    hours.

                    Awwwww! Man! Baaah!
          Casey hands his stick, then quickly turns with a grin.

                              CASEY
                    Later boys!

               CAM FOLLOWS April and Casey as they walk down the street.
               April's not really a hard-ass - she's just forced to be the
               "responsible one" in A
                                    the relationship.

                         Heh-heh... yeah.
               Casey awkwardly places his arm over her shoulder as the cam
               rests and they walk into the distance. He pulls it back down.
               CAM ANGLES ON WALL - As we notice CLAW MARKS sliced into the
               concrete exterior of a building.

               The doors open in Winters Lobby. April struts in, owning the
               place. Casey struggles pulling the pallet holding the LARGE
               CRATE behind them. As she passes reception-

               INT. WINTERS OFFICE

               His darkened office is especially alpha-male - BIG GAME HUNT
               trophies adorn the walls, as do SUITS OF ARMOR from all time
               periods and random strange ARTIFACTS spanning history in
               glass cases.
               Winters sits at his large desk as the large doors open and
               April and Casey spill in.

                                   WINTERS
                         Miss O'Neil. You are a vision.
                         Thirty days in a jungle, and
                         beautiful as ever.
               He shakes her hand and double-cheek kisses her. Casey's eyes
               widen - is THIS what his girlfriend does?

                                    APRIL
                         Hello Max.

                    Actually, It's Ca-

                        (ignoring, back to April)
                    So how was your trip?

                              APRIL
                    You know, the typical - corrupt
                    government officials, double
                    crossed by a jungle guide, all
                    ending in a heart-pounding chase.
          Winters and April chuckle. Cam adjusts to show Casey between
          them in the bg, looking uncomfortable and out of place.

                              APRIL

          Winters BEAMS, way too excited as well. April holds out her
          hand to Casey, who doesn't know what she wants. He awkwardly
          HIGH FIVES her.

                              CASEY
                    Yeah-ha! The fourth General.

                    Oh.
          He hands it to April as she twirls up a CROW-BAR and cracks
          open the front panel.
          INSIDE BOX POV - The light gradually breaks in, until - CREAK
          - the front panel falls to the floor.
          CLOSE ON - Winters' look. Pure wonder and admiration. He
          walks up to it slowly. April and Casey cautiously stay back.

          foot towering wall of granite and obsidian. Eagle warrior
          armor reflecting a South American design... though not from a
          specific time period. Winters rubs his hand over the stone.

                         opportunities you've given me
                         lately. I'd probably be still
                         selling antique curios if you
                         hadn't visited my shop that day.

                         But I have to ask... why the
                         fascination with these particular
                         works of art? I'd never even heard
                         of the Legend of Yaotl until we
                         met.

               EXT. FLASHBACK BATTLEFIELD - 3000 YEARS AGO

               -the armor becomes the back of a HELMET. Camera dollies
               around the helmet until we're looking at a dark and imposing
               figure. YAOTL. His helmet is impenetrable, with eye slits.
               Note - the flashback is dark, shadowed and monochromed.
               Detail is hinted at instead of shown. Very stylized.

                         It was a time long before the
                         Mayans, April. Long before the
                         Aztecs and even the Olmecs. It was
                         a time of legends. A time of
                         greatness. The true mother culture
                         of Central America.
               Cool shots of Yaotl. His armor, his stance, etc.

                         There was a man named Yaotl. More a
                         force of nature than man. And
                         together with his Four Warrior-
                         Priest Generals, they pillaged
                         every culture in their path.
               QUICK SHOTS OF EACH GENERAL. The walk along side Yoatl.
               Possibly slo-mo. We will come to recognize them through their
               distinct armor as the Four Stone Generals - in human form.

                         And for every culture they
                         destroyed, they drank in all the
                         magic and knowledge known to them.

                    They became a warring hurricane,
                    gathering more power and knowledge
                    with each conquest.
          GROUP SHOT - Of five Warriors. High atop a hillside, finally
          stopped. Ready for battle. Their character-specific weapons
          are drawn. Around them is a small army of MINIONS.

                    Then they came across a culture
                    rich with science, magic and their
                    own technology. A South American
                    version of "Atlantis".

                          BEAT)
                    It was like blood in the water for
                    a predator like Yaotl.
          CLOSE ON - Yaotl. As he raises his sword in the air. CAM
          DOLLIES AROUND HIS HEAD REVEALING their opposing forces. An
          army of THOUSANDS. Waving their weapons in the air.
          The opposing army CHARGES. Yaotl's men pull out   a large
          ORNAMENTAL STAND - a "stargate" of sorts. Yaotl   and his men
          are unmoving... as they begin a ceremony. Yaotl   looks to the
          heavens above - as we see a CLUSTER OF SPECIFIC   STARS move
          into place.

                              WINTERS (V.O.)
                    As the army approached, Yaotl used
                    the knowledge they'd gained in
                    black magic and sorcery. Timing
                    their attack with the alignment of
                    the Stars of Kikin, they opened a
                    portal to another world.
          ON CHARGING ARMY - they stop dead in their tracks. Front-lit
          by the OS portal. Don't know what to expect -
          ON PORTAL - A crackling electric circle opens to another
          dimension. Suddenly - DOZENS OF MONSTERS EXPLODE OUT!
          Creatures of all varieties. Gnashing Fangs. Swiping claws.

                              WINTERS (V.O.)
                    They unleashed an army of monsters.
           N BATTLEFIELD - men getting slaughtered (in a nice PG sort
          of way). Quick shots. Intense.

                              WINTERS (V.O.)

                    destroyed the enemy... as   well as
                    Yaotl's own army. Men who   swore to
                    spill their blood for his   cause.
                    Yaotl had to do something   to stop
                    more from coming through.

                         In the end, there were no victors.
                         And they were responsible for the
                         eradication of the greatest culture
                         that will never be known. The

               Casey has fallen asleep, sitting to the side, head in his
               hand. A line of DROOL hangs from his mouth. April is
               fascinated by the story. She nudges Casey who does the

               Casey stops next to a PODIUM holding a priceless-looking

               dangerously close to the vase.

               Winters is still alone in his office. Still studying the
               statue. A beat. He turns his head to the side.

               the Japanese Foot Clan, flanked by three, FOOT NINJAS.

               Winters walks over to his desk. The Statue looms behind them.

               A MAN walks down the sidewalk. As he passes a DARKENED

               Another place that isn't the TMNT lair. Dark and mysterious.
               Don't know where we are. Feels ceremonial. We see close up

               A DEEP VOICE chants OS in a South American tongue as HIGH-
               TECH GEAR is placed on the rock. It becomes powered,
               triggering a reaction in the stone itself.
               Music builds as we see quick shots of the granite cracks

                         -does the other team's chores for a
                         week.
               Leo and Raph glare at each other.

                                   LEONARDO/RAPHAEL
                         Deal.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         I'm with Leo!

                                   DONATELLO
                         Actually, I think you and I should
                         pair up, Mikey.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         You kiddin' me?! I mean, no offense
                         Donnie, but you ain't exactly the
                         biggest hitter on the bench.

          Don is grinning. Observing the subtle tension.

                              DONATELLO
                    Just trust me on this one.
          Music builds to a fun number as the two teams run parallel on
          buildings. The course requires them to work as a TEAM,
          throwing, catching and propelling one another from obstacle
          to obstacle.
          Leo accidentally slips, PLOWING Raph face-first into a brick
          wall. Raph, convinced Leo did it on purpose, uses his next
          opportunity to hurl Leo dangerously high and far over a
          billboard. The situation escalates at each juncture.

                              LEONARDO
                    Have you been avoiding me? Barely
                    seen you since I got home.

                              RAPHAEL
                    I been busy.

                              LEONARDO

                        (SARCASTIC)
                    I see. So... you're definitely not
                    upset at me or anything, right?

                              RAPHAEL
                    Why'd you think that?

                              LEONARDO
                    I don't know... your brother gets
                    to go on a world-wide training
                    mission and you have to stay home.
                    Might upset me too.

                              RAPHAEL
                    Are you trying to make me mad?

                              LEONARDO
                    I'm just saying, I'd understand if
                    you were upset.
          Their intensity ESCALATES.

                              RAPHAEL
                    You wouldn't understand the first
                    thing about me, daddy's boy - OOF!.
           hey both trip over a duct, tumbling in a ball. They stop
          rolling, continue fighting.

                              LEONARDO
                    Is that what this is about? You
                    think Splinter likes me best?

                              RAPHAEL
                    You'd love that, wouldn't you?

               WIDER - Don and Mikey are already sitting there.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         So nice of you to join us,
                         gentledudes.

                                    DONATELLO
                         And by the way, I prefer the
                         classic military corner tuck for my
                         bedsheets.

               M
                ikey and Don high five. Leo and Raph aren't amused. They
               stare down. Raph does his BULLY FLINCH fake-lunge... only Leo
               doesn't twitch. Suddenly-

                                   MICHAELANGELO (O.S.)
                         Whoa! Whawazzat?!
               The others rush over to the edge with Mikey.

                                    ICHAELANGELO
                         You dudes see that up there?
               OFF HIS LOOK - We see LARGE SHADOWS moving with in a large I-
               BEAM CONSTRUCTION SITE. The movement is coming from one of
               the higher floors.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         So what now, captain?

                                   LEONARDO
                         We need to come up with a plan.

                                   RAPHAEL
                         Later!
               Raph RUNS OFF toward the action.

                                   LEONARDO

                         RAPH!!!
               But Raph doesn't stop. All three look at each other. Then-

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Welcome home.

          

          

               EXT. I-BEAM HIGHRISE CONSTRUCTION


          48                                                                48
               The boys cross over on a large CONSTRUCTION CRANE and scale
               up the few more stories to the top. They stand on a scaffold
               underneath the floor of the activity.
               ON WALL - Deep CLAW MARKS are carved into the steel, much
               like by April and Casey's loft. Don notices.

                                   DONATELLO
                         Guys, I've got a bad feeling...

                              RAPHAEL
                    Ahh, let's take a tiny peek.
          They scale to the top floor. Peering over the edge.

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    Well, there's a good/bad news
                    scenario for ya.
          CAM BEGINS TO CRANE UP from Turtles to activity on the floor.

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    Good news is that there are a
                    buncha Foot Ninja gettin' the snot
                    kicked out of `em.
          CAM FINISHES ON FLOOR - Showing SIX FOOT NINJAS and KARAI
          squaring off against a LARGE BIGFOOT-LIKE MONSTER! It tosses
          them around like stuffed animals.

                               ICHAELANGELO (O.S.)
                    Bad news is WHAT's kickin' the snot
                    out of `em...
          ON TURTLES - As they've all now crept up to the dark corner
          of the floor. A FOOT NINJA gets clobbered and sails past
          them, and off the building. (safely to a scaffold below)

                               D

                               ONATELLO
                    An interesting conundrum. Do we
                    hold dear the value of life and
                    help the Foot regardless of our
                    tumultuous past?

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    I vote for sitting back and
                    enjoying the show.
                        (to Leo)
                    Whaddaya say, leader boy?
          ON LEO - He's troubled. The burden of "leader" shouldered.

                              RAPHAEL
                    Nah. We kick butt.
          Raph jumps forward! Leo rolls his eyes, as all the Turtles
          jump into the fray. The Foot are surprised at first, and the
          Bigfoot Monster is confused as well.
          ON LEO - He stops when he comes face to face with Karai.

                               EONARDO
                    Who are YOU?!
          ON KARAI - She pauses a moment. They exchange expert katana
          attacks. Stalemate. She gestures to the Foot as they use this
          opportunity for their escape. As they leap away, Karai looks
          back at the Turtles...

          

          R

          The Creature immediately CHASES the boys throughout the
          structure, as they use all their ninja skills to avoid it,
          not to mention impalement on the bed of rebar below!
           aph tries to turn the tables and attacks the Creature! The
          boys have no choice but to help him... putting them in deeper
          trouble.
          The I-Beam is getting dented and twisted with each impact.
          The tussle begins to fall - whoomp, whoomp - down many
          flights of floors.
          Raph gets separated at one point, jumping off the side of the
          building to catch up, and swings himself back onto the bottom
          floor to await the others.
          SMASH! They fall into Raph's floor.

                              RAPHAEL
                    Nice of ya's ta join me.
          But the Turtles eventually get cornered. And just as the
          Creature closes in-

                              MICHAELANGELO

                    YEEEAAAAARGGHHH!!!!!
          The creature stops. Confused. So are the other three turtles.

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    What? I saw it on a nature show
                    once.
          The creature SCREAMS BACK! Boys freak out.

                              TURTLES

                    AAAAAAGGHHHHH!!!!!

          A
           NGLE ABOVE TURTLES - As a large teetering pallet filled with
          dried cement and blocks to come CRASHING DOWN ON THEM! The
          Turtles are buried under the rubble.
          RUH? - The Creature is confused... until it's hit with a
          blinding light, and then an EXPLOSION - FWOOM! We hear heavy
          footsteps thumping through the light. Shapes start to form
          until we see...
          ...LIVING VERSIONS OF THE FOUR STONE GENERALS! Sporting HIGH
          TECH GEAR - a mix of tech with ancient magic scrawlings.
          Their bodies "glow" with a red inner life, seeping through
          their stone cracks and piercing eyes.
          The Generals are all ANIMAL-THEMED - Mute and powerful Ape-
          themed costume ("MONO"), Eagle Leader ("AGUILA"), agile
          Jaguar ("GATO") and the deadly snake-like female
          ("SERPIENTE"). Large. Imposing. Completely bad-ass.
          The Creature ROARS and FIGHTS to no avail...

          

                                                                         41.

          

          

          
               BURIED POV - Silent. The Turtles start to GROAN, regaining
               consciousness. Moonlight shoots in as they move the rock and
               stand up, groggy.
               ON MOUTH OF ALLEY - Through the smoke we can see silhouettes -
               a large hairy shape, along with FOUR VERY LARGE SHAPES. The
               sounds of freighter doors CLOSING, engines revving and then a
               caravan of sorts pulling away.
               WHOOOOOP! - A POLICE SIREN chirps. Approaching the now-
               destroyed site.

                                   DONATELLO
                         Better hit the tunnels, guys.
               Donnie uses a small prod to prop open a MANHOLE COVER. Don,
               Mike and Leo jump in. Leo looks back, Raph is still stewing.

                                    LEONARDO
                         Raph. Save it for another day.

                             (BEAT)

                         RAPH!
               Raph knows he has to go. Reluctantly he enters the sewer. The
               lid closes as the alley is illuminated by POLICE CHERRIES.

               A
                 beat, then Mikey barely pops the lid open for another peek.

                                   MICHAELANGELO (O.S.)
                         Y'know, it's not that bad, dudes.
               ON BUILDING - Actually, the place is destroyed. Dented, torn
               and looking like a post-night raid in WWII.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               A cavernous structure. Dimly lit. High ceiling. A few odd
               silhouettes here and there.
               We hear the clicking of Winters' shoes echo as he enters.

                                   WINTERS
                         What seems to be the problem?
               Karai and six Ninja are already there.

                                   KARAI
                         The "problem" is that we were hired
                         to merely patrol the city and
                         report anything "strange" to you.

                    You never said anything about

                    MONSTERS.
          Winters smirks, looking at the mouse who thinks he can take
          the lion. He reaches to a satchel on the floor. The Foot
          TENSE in anticipation. Instead... Winters comes up with a

          MONEY BRICK.

                        (tosses money brick)
                    So, your job duties were just
                    redefined. Congratulations on your
                    promotion.
          SHINK! - Karai pulls out her To and slices the brick in mid-
          air. Winters STOPS and looks back over his shoulder.

                              KARAI
                    We may be hired help to you, but
                    you should never forget... we are
                    the Foot Clan.
          ON WINTERS - Condescendingly finds this particularly `cute'.

                              WINTERS
                    Oooooooh...
          It sets the Foot off. They all grab their weapons, moving
          toward Winters. Karai flips forward, sword drawn and at
          Winters throat!
          ...as Winters stands still... and begins to LAUGH.
          Slowly, the thumping of FOUR SETS OF FEET lumber out of the
          shadows. Reveal themselves to be THE FOUR STONE GENERALS.
          They flank Winters, who is just loving the theatricality of
          it all.
          The Foot Ninja leap back. Winters remains confident and
          unmoving. Generals SMIRK at Karai and the Foot.

                               WINTERS
                    I believe we made a deal, Karai. I
                    expect you to honor it.
                         (beat, stares her down)
                    You do understand "honor", don't
                    you?
          Karai stews... unblinking stare. Of course she does.

                              WINTERS
                    So I don't care what part of
                    "muscle for hire" you don't
                    understand. I hired your muscle.
                    Now exercise the ones attached to
                    your feet and...
                        (closer - terse)
                    ...get back to work.

          

                                                                    43.

          

          

          
          Karai slowly steps back. Winters smiles wide, reaches into
          the drawer and takes another brick of bills and tosses it to

                               W
          a Foot Ninja. Then another to a second Ninja.

                               INTERS
                    So I will double... no, no...
                    TRIPLE your pay for your troubles.
                        (stare down)
                    Are we cool?
          ON FOOT - They just stare back, blank goggles. Probably
          seething inside. Winters is flanked by Generals.

                              WINTERS
                    Are we... cool?
          The Foot don't move. Tense. Karai finally nods. Terse.

                              WINTERS
                    Ninjas. No sense of humor.
                        (to Generals)
                    So how did we fare?
          CORRIDOR ENTRANCE - a hunched SHAPE undulating in chains is
          wheeled into the light.
          Winters approaches it - chained to a high-tech and uplit
          pallet on the floor. We can barely make it out as being the
          HAIRY CREATURE from the I-beam fight.

                              WINTERS
                        (close, quiet)
                    So it begins...
          It SCREAMS. Fights it's restraints. Tires. Breathing heavily.
          Winters approaches, safely inches away from his fanged maw.
          Creature suddenly lunges forward! Winters doesn't flinch. He
          merely grins at the creature.

                              WINTERS
                        (to General Aguila)
                    Were there any problems?
          AGUILA speaks in a gravelly, hardened voice. He towers over
          Winters by a foot. Clearly the leader of the four.

                              GENERAL AGUILA
                    None, my lord.

                              WINTERS
                        (to Karai)
                    You see, now THAT'S a good soldier.
                    You two should compare notes.
          Karai and Aguila stare at each other. Karai obviously not
          used to being handled like this.

          

                              K

                              KARAI
                    Just what is this all about?

                              WINTERS
                    Oh, let's call it a scavenger hunt.
                        (re: Generals)
                    I now have the power and know-how,
                    but I need the speed and stealth of
                    an organization such as your own.
                    Not to mention an organization that
                    values discretion.

                              KARAI
                    But of course.

                              WINTERS
                    You see, I have nine more beasts
                    like this that should be coming to
                    town very soon. Thirteen in all, to
                    be exact.
          The Four Generals move the monster into a position on the
          floor ahead - into a DISK on the floor. ON CEILING - We see
          the top of a CAGE inserted over top, creating a cell.

                               ARAI
                    But... why? Why here? Why now?

                               WINTERS
                    Instinct, mostly. They're animals
                    at their core.
                        (looks off, distant)
                    And they recognize something
                    familiar in the air... in the
                    stars.

                        (BEAT)
                    What can I say? I'm a lover of
                    animals.
          The disk ROTATES. WIDER we see that there are already some
          cells inserted on the large stone disk in the floor. Filled
          by darkened silhouettes of creatures that we're probably glad

                               W
          we don't fully see. Glowing eyes pierce out of the darkness.

                               INTERS
                    So you go and get to know each
                    other. And don't forget... play
                    nice.
          The Generals turn and walk-push the Foot out of the door.
          They move to fight back, but Karai waves her hand.

                              KARAI
                    Not now. Our business will be
                    handled at a later time...

               After they leave, we pause for A BEAT on Winters. Quiet.
               Tired. Contemplative.

               INT. TURTLES LAIR - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

               Three brothers sit around their breakfast table, looking hung
               over from the previous night's brawl. Mikey comes in, looking
               the worst of all, and plops into his seat. Cam circles table.

                         Dudes, did anyone get the license
                         plate of the thing that hit us last
                         night? Oi, my head...
               Don pours over a thick book on MONSTERS AND MYTHOLOGY.

                                   DONATELLO
                         Was it just me, or did that
                         creature look familiar?

                                   RAPHAEL
                         We coulda taken it if you slackers
                         woulda pitched in sooner.

                                   LEONARDO
                         Fact remains, Raph, that we should
                         have never been there in the first
                         place.

                         Well, I suppose that we shoulda let
                         Mr. Cuddly-kins continue to spread
                         happiness throughout the city... oh
                         wait... HE WAS A FREAKING MONSTER
                         TRYIN' TA KILL US!!! Good call,

                         Come to think of it, it WAS pretty
                         strange to see the Foot too. And
                         who was that woman?

                         only one who has to be responsible!

                    Morning, sensei.
          Splinter makes himself a TEA. Room is SILENT.
          ON TURTLES - Raph and Leo GLARE at one another while they
          eat. Don is pouring over a THICK BOOK while Mikey sits with
          his forehead on the table.

                              SPLINTER
                    If anyone needs me, I'll be
                    watching my stories.

           plinter walks out. OS sound of the TV being turned on. At
          the table, the glare continues.

                    And in the latest of a string of
                    strange criminal activity, a
                    construction site was nearly
                    destroyed last night. Authorities
                    believe a violent battle had taken
                    place earlier that evening.
          The boys react and rush into the MAIN LIVING AREA.
          ON TV - a well-coifed News Reporter stands outside of the I-
          BEAM TOWER. In the daylight, we can see the building is
          twisted and dented from the night's fighting.
          The boys immediately JUMP FORWARD. Mikey grabs the remote and
          ups the volume.

                              SPLINTER
                    My sons, what-
          Splinter's eyes go wide. He looks at his boys listening to
          the TV intently. Mikey nurses his sore head.

                              SPLINTER
                    I believe you boys have some
                    explaining to do...

                         Leonardo, I am most disappointed in
                         you. You are the leader of your
                         brothers. I was counting on you to
                         bring order to the chaos of this
                         family.

                         But Master Splinter, how can I be
                         expected to do so when Ra-

                                   SPLINTER
                         There are no excuses when you are
                         the Leader, my student.
               ON LEO - Biting his tongue. Hard.

                                   SPLINTER
                         But the involvement of the Foot and
                         their mysterious leader worries me.

                                    ICHAELANGELO
                         I'm personally worried about a

                         We hafta go out and find who's

                         Raphael, there are better ways to
                         use your skills in ninjitsu. Fact-
                         gathering. Analysis. Observation.
                         Direct contact should only be your
                         last resort.

               QUICK SHOTS - Nightwatcher gearing up.
                 ightwatcher emerges from a MAN HOLE. Walks to a long-
               forgotten and shadowed underside of a BRIDGE. He points up
               with a REMOTE - chirp! Slowly, his MOTORBIKE begins to lower
               on retractable grappling hooks.

               Various shots of Nightwatcher tearing all over the city. On
               bike and on foot. Angry. Trying to work it out of his system.
               He's swallowed it all up to this point... getting harder.

               Aggressive and driving music. Various shots of the Stone
               Generals capturing a laundry list of CREATURES that are
               coming into the city. See the tech, detail and precision that
               the Winters' operation works. Foot Ninja act as living
               "tracking devices" around the city.
               - The Generals capture a Sloth-like creature, jumping in
               throughout rafters above. The Foot try to help by blocking
               exits.
               - The Generals capture a werewolf-like creature in the high-
               speed subway tunnels. The Foot maneuver the subway car.
               - General Mono takes on a large scale YETI-like monster. A
               WWE-sized match set in a large abandoned warehouse.
               - Close calls, as humans come close to seeing the monsters...
               but rarely do. We see small house pets swiped away. Fleeting
               glimpses of limbs, claws and teeth in the shadows all over
               NYC. Meat trucks torn open and their contents "stolen".

               April is dressed in work-out gear on a grouping of floor
               mats. She twirls a wooden KATANA as part of a floor routine.
               Wow - she's actually pretty good! Casey eats a bag of chips
               with one hand, does curls with a dumbbell with the other.

                                   CASEY
                         Nah. Ever since you started with
                         the blade weapons you, um... you
                         kinda scare me.

                                   APRIL
                         Suit yourself.
                             (she stops - a beat)
                         Case?

                                   CASEY
                         Yeah?

                             (AWKWARD)
                         Are you happy? I mean, with your
                         life. With me.
               Casey pauses a beat. Tries to be upbeat.

                                    CASEY
                         Yeah. Sure.
                              (beat - serious)
                         You?
               April thinks just as much.

                                   APRIL
                         Yeah.
               They sit on that for a moment. Casey leans in for a kiss.
               April doesn't notice. Awkward. Casey changes his mind.

                                   CASEY
                             (walks to the window)

               Casey slips out onto the fire escape. April knows better.

                                   APRIL
                             (to herself)

               Casey climbs up from the fire escape. Checks to make sure
               he's alone. He reaches inside a chimney flue and pulls out -
               A BASEBALL BAT and his CLASSIC WHITE HOCKEY MASK!
               He slips it on. Does a few warm up swings. Cricks his neck.

               All is still, until the panicked face of a BURGLAR enters
               frame. Being held by his collar.

                                   BURGLAR

                         I'M SORRY MAN! I-I-I WON'T EVER DO

                         IT AGAIN! I'M SORR-OOOF!
               BAM! - the leather fist of Nightwatcher slams Burglar back,
               tripping over an A/C duct. He tries to shield himself-
               REVERSE ANGLE - BOOM! - Nightwatcher lands in the FG.

                                    IGHTWATCHER
                         Funny how you jerks don't care
                         about crossing the line `til
                         someone else does it... all over
                         yer HEAD!
               Night hurls him back into a roof access door, denting it.
               Raph's loving this. Walks to the Burglar and picks him up.

                                   BURGLAR
                             (almost in tears)

                         night to be a criminal...
               Night cocks his fist just as-

                ight slowly turns around. Menacing. Casey's taken aback.

                    instructor... Casey Jones.
          It's getting serious. Casey's bat is suddenly wrapped by
          Night's CHAIN, and pulled down. Raph's visor flips up.

                         creature... when there was still

                         above the lair. Just didn't seem
                         right. `Specially if we had the

                         it, tho. So I just saved up, bought
                         and tweaked a sweet bike, fitted

                         seems like all I do lately is just
                         make her upset. She used to laugh
                         so much... now it's mostly just
                         working all day, and coming home to

               The two run and leap across the rooftops. Two vigilantes

          Creature. They subdue it with all their hardware. The Foot
          stand guard, helping in the BG.

          One of the generals effortlessly picks up a TRASH DUMPSTER
          and wallops the Creature with one blow.

                    On second thought...
          The Generals put the Creature in a cell. Wheel it to a
          TRANSPORTER VEHICLE as it drives away. They're just about to
          leave when-

               roof - FWOOM! When the smoke clears, Casey is standing there
               alone! Raph is 10 feet away as Casey flinches and takes off
               too.

               Raph and Casey are tearing ass through the alleyways, trying

               Raph ignores him, looking for a street sign. Then he sees it -

               bounding down the wall, almost in a four-legged run,

               jaguar. It leaps through the traffic as well.

                    Hop on.
          Raph leaves Gato in a cloud of dust... but not for long. Gato
          clamors along... keeping up with the weaving bike! In the
          fray, Casey looses his mask... as it gets trampled by Gato.
          It's an insane chase, with Raph trying to lose him as Casey
          swings his bat, trying to stave off the Stone General.
          Suddenly - THUNK!
          A circular OBSIDIAN BLADE lands in his wooden bat. He looks
          at it.

                    Um, Raph?
          Raph sees the blade! They manage to switch positions in mid-
          ride, with Casey driving and Raph in back. Raph throws kicks
          and punches at their pursuer when he closes in.
          The chase takes them to a PARKING GARAGE as they circle
          upwards, Gato jumping from car to car, still on their tails!
          ROOFTOP - They're trapped. He doesn't have a hope... aside

          and crucial pieces fly off the undercarriage. They both look
          back at Gato up and away at the top of the structure.

          Casey guns it - BUT THE BIKE DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE - as Gato
          is in mid-air, taking off. Casey grabs the weakening Raph and
          drags him off.

               Gato lands and patrols the roof... almost SNIFFING them out.
               Casey and Raph are barely hidden inside a rooftop shack.
               Suddenly - BOOM! - Gato finds them. He tries to smash through
               the steel door with his bare hands!
               Raph leans his body into the door as a last ditch effort.
               He's taking a pounding as the door is denting with each slam
               by Gato. Casey tries to help as well.
               Gato comes close to breaking in. Very tense. Then-
               -the LIGHT on his exo-suit begins to STROBE. A signal. A
               signal to return home. He surveys quickly... then runs off.
               Casey and Raph fall out. Both shell-shocked.

               April is finishing up with her workout. She hears the fire
               escape outside of the building and the window slide open.

          ON RAPH'S SHELL - Two Obsidian Disks are wedged in his back
          with a Tranquilizer Dart. Donnie wedges out the Obsidian Disk
          with pliers.
           LOSE ON - Disk. It's beautiful and deadly. Don examines.

                    There's an engraving on it.
                    Looks... South American. Aztec? No.
                    It's definitely not Mayan.
          April swallows hard.

          April sits down on the floor with the disk. Trying to figure
          things out. Casey leans down to her.

                              CASEY
                    Would it help things if I said that
                    we were being chased by a one of
                    those statues you collected for
                    that Winters guy?
          ON APRIL - Her mouth is agape.

                              MICHAELANGELO

                    thirty-foot flying monster would
                    probably just push this over the
                    edge, huh?
          ON APRIL - She slowly turns to Casey. Floored.

                              LEONARDO
                    What are you talking about Casey?

                              CASEY
                    Just some story this Winters guy
                    told us. It all started down in
                    South America. Long before the
                    Ashmecks and the Macaroons.

                              APRIL
                    Azteks and Mayans.

                              CASEY
                    That's what i said.

          CAM PANS TO THE RIGHT - As it passes a FG element, the screen
          dips to black. We hear sounds of a violent BATTLE. Monsters
          shrieking. Blades clashing. April's retelling Winters' story.

                                                         DIP TO BLACK:
          Everyone is gathered around as April finishes. Mikey, in
          particular, is hunched over, intent. Casey, like before, has
          fallen asleep. Silence for a beat. Then-

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    Well?! WHAT NEXT?!!!

                              APRIL
                    No one knows. The legend stops
                    there.

                    But it's just a legend.
          Donnie studies the tranq dart under a magnifying glass of
          April's.

                              DONATELLO
                    The micro-tech of this dart is
                    astounding. The molybdenum is of a
                    grade only found in a few select
                    markets... not to mention it's
                    current stock is going for a little
                    more than two-grand an ounce right

                    So what do we have? We have someone
                    with a lot of money.

                               ONATELLO
                    Access to technology... and the
                    means to produce it to exact specs.

                              RAPHAEL
                    Not to mention having a keen
                    interest in these monsters... and
                    them four stone jokers.

                              DONATELLO
                    If you ask me, it all somehow
                    points to Winters Corp.

                              LEONARDO
                    How do you figure that, Donnie?
          Donatello looks up with MAGNIFYING GOGGLES on. Sarcastic.

                              DONATELLO
                    Hello? "Genius"?
                        (a beat)
                    Well, that, and the fact that this
                    part has a Winters Corporation logo
                    on it.

                               EONARDO
                    Do you think he's trying to
                    recreate the events from back then?

                              RAPHAEL
                    Well, what would you do with an
                    army of monsters?

                              MICHAELANGELO

                    wrestling league, I dunno... MAYBE

                              LEONARDO
                    Do bad guys still try to do that?

                               DONATELLO
                    Yes, however they're usually
                    mortgage re-fi companies.

                        (THEN)

                    freakin' hairball that attacked us?

                               APHAEL

                    and flying creature that attacked
                    me n' Casey?

                              APRIL
                    Okay. Fine. I'll help for now...
                    until we prove you're all insane.

                              LEONARDO
                    Or until we prove Winters is up to
                    something more than collecting art.

                              DONATELLO
                    I'll work with April and see if
                    these Stars of Kikin she told us
                    about can give us any clues.

                              RAPHAEL
                    I say we just storm the castle and
                    face this jerk in person!

                              LEONARDO
                    Raph, that would be the worst idea
                    yet. We hang back. Analyze.
                    Formulate a plan, THEN storm your
                    castle. Are we clear?
          Tense stare off between Raph and Leo. Raph moves anyway.
          Casey stops him. Quieter moment.

                               CASEY
                    Raph. Don't do it, man.

                    I spent my whole life running out
                    of rooms ticked off at the world. I
                    wish I could take most of `em back.
                    Sometimes, just takin' a breather
                    is the best thing to do.
          ON APRIL - She's listening to Casey... maybe her man-boy is
          growing up. Raph knows he can't win.

                              RAPHAEL

               his helmeted head repeatedly to the floor! It lunges forward,
               mouth open as Night backhands it with a PLATE. The Demon
               jumps back and up, landing on a rotating CEILING FAN.

                he creature lunges down again, but this time, Night is
               ready. He fights back. Like fighting with a Chihuahua hopped
               up on cocaine.
               A break in the fight. The creature has disappeared. Night
               knows he's there. He preps. Grabs his SMOKE PELLETS from his
               pocket. And waits... until...

                        (victory taunting)
                    Yeah! That's what I thought! Don't
                    mess with the Nightwatcher!
          Night turns. His helmet is still on. He hits his LIGHTS on
          the side of his head to see through the thick smoke. He finds
          the DINER COOK huddled behind the counter. Night looks scary.

                              DINER COOK
                    Pl-pl-please don't hurt me!

                               NIGHTWATCHER
                    Whattaya talkin' about? I JUST

                    SAVED YOU!

                              DINER COOK
                    Please, sir. I have kids.
          Night looks around. He sees the CASH REGISTER on the floor.
          He picks it up, puts it on the counter.

                              NIGHTWATCHER
                    There ya go, pal. Make sure this is
                    safe. HEY - YOU HEARIN' ME?

                              DINER COOK

                    TAKE IT! JUST TAKE IT! DON'T HURT

                    ME, PLEASE!

                              NIGHTWATCHER

                    LISTEN! I DON'T WANT YER FRIGGIN'

                    CASH! WHY DOES EVERYONE HAVE SUCH A

                    HARD TIME BELIEVIN' I'M A GOOD GUY?
                        (points threatening)

                    I JUST SAVED YOUR STINKIN' LIFE!
          Sudddenly - SHINK! - a THROWING STAR is lodged in the cash
          register till! Night jumps. Looks out the window.
          CAM PULLS WAY WAY BACK, REALLY FAST - Out the Diner and to
          the rooftop across the street... and over the green shoulders
          of LEO.
           ll he sees is a panicked man and the large shape of
          Nightwatcher standing over him, holding the register.
          CLOSE ON LEO - He's fuming. Staring down at Nightwatcher. The
          frustration of the last few days pent up inside of him.

          B
           ACK IN DINER - Night slowly lays down the register. Trying
          to figure out his next move.

                              NIGHTWATCHER
                    This night just keeps gettin'
                    better n' better...

               Tense stand-off as... Night suddenly bolts out the back as
               Leo bolts the roof in hot pursuit!

          

          

          78                                                                78

               EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS

               Night tears down the streets and through back alleys. Leo
               keeps up with him effortlessly, hurling an assortment of
               THROWING STARS his way.
               Night suddenly DASHES OUT into traffic! Jumping over passing
               cars from roof to roof!

                                   LEONARDO
                         Nice try, amateur.
               Leo crosses the busy street while still maintaining his
               secrecy. Zip lines through power lines, avoids an oncoming
               bus, and flips back onto a cable.
                e swings and manages to snag Nightwatcher in mid-leap!

                                   LEONARDO
                         Oof! You're a heavy boy, aren't
                         you?
               They both land on a fire escape, as Night clamors to the top.
               Leo wastes no time in catching up.

          

          

          79                                                                79

               EXT. ROOFTOPS - CONTINUOUS

               The chase continues. Night giving it his all, and Leo keeping
               up pretty easily. He throws Leo a pretty strong curveball,
               and Leo barely recovers.

                                   LEONARDO
                         Okay, someone's been training
                         pretty hard.
               It begins to spit rain - and becomes a FRANK MILLER DOWNPOUR.

          

          

               EXT. ROOFTOP DEAD END - CONTINUOUS


          80                                                                80
               Night reaches an area that's a DEAD END. One side of the
               buildings has a LARGE LETTERED SIGN facing away. Fills the
               rooftop with silhouettes. No choice but to turn around...
               ...as Leo slows to a stop at the other end of the building.

                                   LEONARDO
                         I want you to know that I
                         appreciate your intentions. But you
                         can't change the world like this.
               INSIDE HELMET - All we hear is rain pouring. Raph can't hear
               Leo - just sees him wagging his finger at him.

          

                                                                     70.

          

          

          

                              NIGHTWATCHER
                        (to himself in helmet)

                              L
                    Oh god. He's lecturing.

                               EONARDO
                        (now audible)
                    ...so I'm going to give you one
                    chance to just walk away and stop
                    this vigilante nonsense.
          Leo unsheathes his two katanas. Raph can't hear him.

                              NIGHTWATCHER
                        (to himself in helmet)
                    Okay, Leo. Wanna play?
          Nightwatcher drops TWIN BOLOS. He twirls them with
          expertise... then motions for Leo to fight. Charge at each
          other, running through the rain, weapons drawn.
          They fight. Hard. And with expertise. Two masters duking it
          out. It surprises Leo. It fills Night with more adrenaline.
          There's a break. They circle like tigers. Renewing attacks.
          Night knows every one of Leo's moves, and counters in turn.

                              LEONARDO
                    What? How did you-
          ...then he starts goading him on. Pushing Leo. Prodding.
          Making him MAD. ...and then Leo fights back. HARD.
          Night can't keep up. Leo uses every bit of his control,
          restraint and expertise. He surgically slices the bind under
          Night's helmet. He jumps on top of the vigilante.

                              LEONARDO
                    Goodnight, dark prince.
          Leo UPPERCUTS Night, knocking his helmet off! His face
          falls... IT'S RAPHAEL! Leo pales.

                              LEONARDO
                    R-raph?

                        (THINKS)
                    What?
          But Raph doesn't feel like explaining. Refuses defeat.

                              RAPHAEL

                    AAAAAAAAGHH!!
          He mule kicks Leo back. Leo tumbles back, still in shock.
          They yell at each other through the pouring rain.

          

                                                                          71.

          

          

          

                                   RAPHAEL
                         You're so friggin' smug! You think
                         the world revolves around YOU,
                         dontcha? That we couldn't POSSIBLY
                         survive without the mighty and
                         powerful Leonardo to guide us
                         through our problems, HUH?!

                             (PACES)
                         Well, I gotta newsflash for ya - we
                         got along just fine without you.

                                   LEONARDO
                         I was training! Training to be a
                         better leader! For you! Why do you
                         hate me for that?!

                                   RAPHAEL
                         ...and whoever said I wanted to be
                         led? I shoulda gone on that
                         training!

                                   LEONARDO

                         Y
                          OU WEREN'T READY! You're impatient
                         and hot-tempered! And more
                         importantly... I'm better than you.
               Raph stops in his tracks. Reaches behind his back... and
               pulls out his TWIN SAIS. He flips them to the front.

                                   RAPHAEL
                         Well, big brother, I'd have to
                         disagree with you on that one.
               Raph takes a ready stance. Leo does too. And they fight.
               Brother vs. brother. Katana vs. Sai. Technique vs. Heart.

               In another part of the city, the Generals have caught the
               Demon from Pete's Diner. As they carry him to the caravan,
               their RADIO COMM goes off.

               Camera RISES UP until we reach the rooftop where Leo and Raph
               continue to duke it out in the rain.
               They battle. In the end, Raph becomes an uncontrollable ball
               of anger, unleashing everything on Leo.

               It ends with Raph pinning Leo to the ground... holding a sai

               MILLIMETERS FROM HIS EYEBALL!
               Tense. Raph shakes. He looks like he's going to do it... then
               stops. He collapses back. Almost ashamed of what he's done.
               Leo just can't believe that Raph bested him. They pant
               heavily. The rain dies down.
               Raph RUNS AWAY, across a few rooftops. Away from his brother.
               He suddenly STOPS and looks back at Leo, small in the
               distance.
               CLOSE ON LEO - A SHADOW suddenly falls over him. He looks up
               to see the FOUR GENERALS surrounding him. He tries to fight
               back... but is too wiped from Raph.
               GATO POV - "reading" Leo on the ground. He frowns.

                                   GENERAL GATO
                         It is neither monster nor human.
               CLOSE ON AGUILA - He manages a small smile.

                                   GENERAL AGUILA
                         Then he shall perfectly serve our
                         purposes... let us inform our
                         commander that the final creature
                         has been captured.
               ON RAPH - He sees the commotion from afar... as Leo gets
               TRANQUILIZED with the Generals' dart cannon.

                                   RAPHAEL

                         LEO!!!
               Raph runs closer as the Generals lower to the ground and
               drive off. Raph jumps from rooftop to rooftop to try and
               catch his brother.

                                   RAPHAEL

                         L
                          eo!!! Hang on!!
               But the Caravan is too fast, and eventually loses Raph.

                         NOOOOOOOO!!!!
               Raph gets weak and collapses to his knees on the roof. The
               sun begins to rise. He has to return to the sewer.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Raphael walks to Splinter, practicing himself in the dojo.
               Raph holds his Sais in one hand, his bolo chain in the other.
               Clenches both tight.

                                   SPLINTER
                         Raphael? What is the matter?

                         I was out, and did... something...
                         something happened and I- ARRRGH!!!
               Raphael picks up a HEAVY WEIGHT and hurls is across the dojo.
               Splinter is unfazed, but he won't take any more.

                                   SPLINTER
                         Raphael! Kneel.
               Raph stops. Breathing heavy. Falls in line - walking to
               Splinter and dropping to his knees in front of his father.

                                   RAPHAEL
                         I did something... I did something
                         really stupid, Master Splinter.

                                    SPLINTER
                         Go on...

                                   RAPHAEL

                             (SEMI-RAMBLING)
                         I know why you chose him now. I
                         know that there's a reason why he's
                         the better son and I'm not.

                             (THINKS)
                         And I think I made things worse
                         tonight.
                             (beat - calming down)
                         A WHOLE lot worse... I know you
                         must be ashamed of me, father.
               Raphael is lost in his guilt. Splinter kneels in front of
               Raph.

                                   SPLINTER
                         Raphael. You always bear the
                         world's problems on your shoulders.
                         It is an admirable quality when you
                         are a protector of others...
                plinter gently lays a hand on Raph's shoulder.

          

                                                                       74.

          

          

          

                                   SPLINTER
                         But you must realize that while, at
                         times, you may not be my favorite
                         student, it does not mean that you
                         are my least favorite son.
               Raphael looks up. Having not thought of it that way.

                                   SPLINTER
                         You are strong, passionate and
                         loyal to a fault. These are the
                         merits of a great leader as well...
                         but only when tempered with
                         compassion and humility.

                                   RAPHAEL
                         But Master Splinter, I messed up
                         big tonight... I mean BIG.
               Splinter chews on this.

                                   SPLINTER
                         Leonardo? R

                                (beat, ashamed)
                         Yes.
               Splinter is grim. Nods. But he moves on.

                                   SPLINTER
                         Well then, I believe your brothers
                         may be in need of a leader.
               Raphael looks up. Finally, his shot. He holds his SAIS in one
               hand, and his BOLO CHAIN in the other. Ninja Turtle vs.
               Nightwatcher. He grips them both hard. He drops the chain.

                                   RAPHAEL
                         Thank you... father.

                    So, the first time that this portal
                    was opened, the Stars of Kikin

                        (sketches on high tech

                    ...and that's why it occurred in

                        (more doodles)
                    Now if we take into account the
                    continual rotation of the Earth
                    since then, as well as the gradual
                    celestial shift that's happened and
                    been recorded over... well, over
                    the course of that mountain of
                    books over there... we now know our
                    new location.
          Donnie's drawn a NEW LINE from the alignment of the stars.
          April elbows Casey to wake him up.

               The lobby has changed. Shots establishing the jury-rigged
               nature of Winters Tower.
               - The large Aztec-like calendar on the lobby floor suddenly
               SPLITS and slides open, creating a 100 foot circle in the
               middle. Underneath is the TOWERS CELL BASEMENT.

               -
                 The   disk in the basement is suddenly RAISED up to the lobby
               area,   replacing the slick marble design with an antiquated
               stone   version. Only now, THIRTEEN CREATURE CELLS surround the
               disk.   Very ceremonial.
               - Finally, Winters' office elevator LOWERS from high above.
               He's in the actual ceremonial gear worn by Yaotl years ago.
               He holds the helmet to his side. Very serious. He looks over
               his now-ceremonial lobby... satisfied.

               Quick shots of April and Casey gearing up. Casey with his off-
               the-shelf sporting gear. April with sleek-looking Japanese
               combat gear and weaponry.
               They both emerge from their rooms, dressed to kill. Casey's
               jaw drops as we scope out April.

                         readings coming in off the charts.
                         Authorities are imposing a curfew

               FURTHER DOWN THE STREET - We see Winters Tower and the
               darkest clouds of all beginning to collect overhead.

          

          

               INT. WINTERS LOBBY

               Winters stands with Four Generals in his office, overseeing
               the portal. Ready.

          

          

               INT. WINTERS GARDEN - MOMENTS LATER


          91                                                                91
               Karai walks down the center path of the garden, flanked by a
               DOZEN FOOT NINJA. She motions for them to take position.

                                   KARAI
                         As ordered - no one gets in. No one
                         interferes. No one bears witness.
               SUDDENLY - the security alarm from the front gate BUZZES.
               Karai waits a beat. It buzzes again. She walks to the
               SECURITY PANEL by the front gate.
                N MONITOR - We see CASEY standing there, obscured by a LARGE
               WOODEN CRATE IN FRONT OF HIM. Karai coldly opens the gate.

          

          C

                              KARAI
                    May I help you?

                              CASEY
                    Yeah, hey, I was supposed   to drop
                    this off for Mr. Winters.   If I
                    don't get this done, I am   majorly
                    in the doghouse. You know   what I'm
                    sayin', right? Right?
          The two stare at each other as the CAM ANGLES BEHIND KARAI -
          she's holding a KATANA SWORD behind her back!
           AM DOLLIES OVERHEAD as we see that Casey is packing MAJOR
          sports gear "heat" on his end too. Both don't let on.

                              KARAI
                    Please come in, then.

                              CASEY
                    Really!?
                        (beat - gets composed)
                    I mean, "but of course".
          Casey wheels the crate inside. The gate closes only KARAI HAS
          NOW DISAPPEARED! Casey opens the front hatch, revealing Don,
          Raph, Mikey, April and Splinter.

                               R

                               APHAEL

                        (waves hand in front of
                         nose, glares at MIkey)
                    And who did that?!

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    What?! Why does everyone always
                    call ME out?
          A long beat. Then...

                              SPLINTER
                    I apologize my sons.
          Everyone looks at sheepish Splinter. A beat. Suddenly-
          WIDER - The empty garden begins to move. CREEPY, as DOZENS OF
          FOOT NINJA begin to rise out of the shadows and slink toward
          our heroes, surrounding them.
          KARAI makes a dramatic entrance, landing in front of April
          and Casey. Tense beat.

                              CASEY
                    I suppose this is where we all take
                    out our sharp and pointy things?

                              KARAI
                    You suppose correctly.

               ON HEROES - As they all draw their weapons. HIGH ANGLE as the
               Foot all draw theirs. Stand-off. Raph twirls his sais.

                                   RAPHAEL

               INT. WINTERS TOWER

               Winters walks along all the cells - a final check. He
               examines one of the cells.
               PUSH IN - it's LEO. He's slowly waking up - groggy. Muttering
               incoherently. He PASSES OUT AGAIN.

          

          

          93                                                             93

               EXT. WINTERS PARK

               We finally get to see how much of an ass-kicker Master
               Splinter is. Same with April, who squares off against Karai.
               They fight hard. April ends up cornered, about to be skewered
               by her blade when...
               -CLUNK! She wobbles and then passes out. When Karai falls out
               of frame, she reveals CASEY JONES a hundred yards behind her
               holding his HOCKEY STICK! April frowns.

                                   APRIL
                         I had the situation under control.

                                   CASEY

                             (SMIRKS)
                         You're welcome.
               Mikey fights the most like Jackie Chan - comical maneuvers
               backed by solid-hitting blows. Don uses his bo-staff in 1001
               different ways, both offensively and defensively.
               Casey is enjoying the hell out of it. High flying, adrenaline
               rush. He even catches April checking him out, and vice versa.
               April suddenly spots an opening to the front doors!

                                   APRIL
                         Guys! Front door is open. Now!
               They all charge the front door!

          

          

               INT. WINTERS TOWER


          94                                                             94
               Winters is happy. He looks up to the heavens. Checks a time
               piece. Winters begins chanting ANCIENT MAGICK/SPELLS. Looks
               up through the opening in the middle of the building.

                                    INTERS

               The cam PULLS UP through the building. Up over NYC. Through
               the clouds... and into space until we pass all ALIGNED STARS.

               S
                PACE - The final star drifts into position. A LIGHT BURST
               EFFECT travels down each star, headed to Earth.
               BACK IN LOBBY - The light burst flies into the lobby and hits
               the circle in the middle of all the monsters' cells.
               ON CIRCLE - The pieces suddenly start to move around. Almost
               like a sliding puzzle. Then they start to randomly SINK
               further into the ground. Light pours out of them, until all
               of them give way to create THE PORTAL.
               POV OFFICE ABOVE - Each of the Thirteen Cells LIGHT UP to
               acknowledge their contents. 1... 2... 3...

                                   WINTERS
                         Finally... finally!
               ON GENERALS - they're still. Emotionless.
               The light sequence gets to Leo's cell... it doesn't light up.

                                    WINTERS
                         What?
               His mind reels. Looks down at the cells. Nothing. Then it
               hits him like a ton of bricks. He turns to the Generals...

                                   WINTERS
                         What did you do?!

               INT. WINTERS LOBBY

               Our six Heroes all tear into the lobby. They turn back, an
               army of ninjas closing in on them!

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         What do we do, dudes?!

                         I'm working on it.
               Raph grips his sais with renewed strength. Casey looks
               around, putting things together mentally. Tension builds!

                                   RAPHAEL
                         We get ready for round two.
               ON CASEY IN CORNER - He reaches into his back, takes out a
               hockey stick and - SMASH!!! - kills a LOBBY VASE. Suddenly,
               sirens blare as the OUTSIDE BUILDING SECURITY SHUTTERS SLAM
               DOWN just like in Act I!
               The Ninjas are locked out!

                    Yeah!
          Everyone high fives Casey. Except April. She smiles.

                              APRIL
                    Nice work, Jones.

                              CASEY
                    I have my moments...

                    Look!
          OFF DON'S LOOK - the mayhem builds at the other end of the
          vast lobby. The cells are glowing. The portal worsens.

                               DONATELLO
                    And that would be the swirling
                    vortex to another world, I assume.

                        (BEAT)
                    Cool.
          They all run over. Mikey runs to a cell.

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    Leo! Is that you?
          RAARRGH! - A claw swoops out. He dodges out of the way.

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    I guess that would be a "no".
          ON RAPH - He finds Leo!

                              DONATELLO
                    Out of the way, please.

          out. LIFELESS.

                    Hey buddy! Come on, man. Leo,
                    please wake up!
          Raph holds Leo in his lap on the floor. Looks like Leo is
          DEAD. Raph's head falls low, as...

                              LEONARDO (O.S.)
                    Wh-wh-what took you s-so long?
          WIDER - Leo is alive. Coughs and slowly gets his strength
          back. Stands up. He and Raph look at each other. Leo can only
          imagine what Raph's been through to rescue him. A beat.

                              RAPHAEL

               SMASH!!!!
               ANGLE UP - As WINTERS is thrown out the window of his
               elevator office! He heads straight for a sword wielding
               BRONZE STATUE... particularly the sword part. Closer...
               closer... and...
                ..just misses it. WHUMP! He crashes onto the floor.

               MOTIONLESS.
               ON GROUP - They just stare at him. Back up to the office,
               nearly 150 feet above them.
               ON BALCONY ABOVE - Aguila looks down. Snarls.

               INT. WINTERS LOBBY

               Winters' body still lays on the floor. This is bad.

                                   CASEY
                         Is he... is he dead?
               Mikey takes out a hockey stick from Casey's bag and pokes
               Winters' limp body. Nothing.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Yup. He's WAY dead, dude.
               WINTERS GASPS FOR AIR! Startles everyone in the room.
               ON EVERYONE - Their faces all drop as Winters stands up in
               his mini-crater, brushes himself off and is perfectly fine!
               Winters' mind is racing a mile a minute. Doesn't even notice
               those around him.

                                   WINTERS

                             (GROANS)
               Raph can't take it any more. He draws his sais and thrusts
               them at Winters. THAT gets his attention. Winters looks up in
               awe at seeing the mutated freaks in front of him.

               Winters collapses on the floor. Head in hands.

                         This was our chance. We could have
                         changed it all.

               The same red-tinted battlefield we left in Winter's
               flashback. Monsters are leaping through the hoards.

                                    W

                                    INTERS (V.O.)
                         There are things, Miss O'Neil, no
                         one could possibly know...
               Camera pushes in on YAOTL and his Four Generals high on a
               hill, surveying the action.
               ON YAOTL - He takes off his helmet... IT'S WINTERS HIMSELF.

                                   WINTERS (V.O.)
                         It was I who stood on that
                         battlefield all those years ago.
               Winters/Yaotl looks out at the death and destruction. He
               looks shocked, surprised.
               A SHADOW falls over Winters body. He looks up - it's a
               ceremonial SHAMAN from their enemies' camp.

                                   WINTERS (V.O.)
                         And we had to pay a price.
               The Shaman makes hand gestures, chanting. Winters is pulled
               up in the air, and in a crackle of red electricity, we see
               him become... grayer.
                N GENERALS - Same electricity. Different effect. They
               scream, slowly turned into STONE. Cracks form on their
               bodies, light shooting out of it.

                                   WINTERS (V.O.)
                         We were cursed that day. My four
                         comrades-in-arms were turned into
                         stone.

                    Cursed to live on this Earth...
                    immobile... yet fully aware at all
                    times to ponder the crimes we've
                    committed.
          ON WINTERS - He stands on the battlefield. Alone. As he
          walks, the CAM MOVES around him. During this, we X-DISSOLVE
          BETWEEN A FEW SELECT TIME PERIODS between then and now.

                              WINTERS (V.O.)
                    My curse was to live... forever. To
                    feel the pain of losing love time
                    and time again. Of boredom. The
                    pain... of time.
           ACK IN PRESENT DAY. Winters stops walking...

                              WINTERS
                    We were doomed to live this way
                    until, as the Shaman put it, "you
                    corrected the mistakes of your
                    past".
                        (gestures to the lobby)
                    That's what this is about. Penance,
                    Miss O'Neil. Finally getting a
                    chance to right our wrongs.

                              GENERAL AGUILA (O.S.)
                    Our master fails to include crucial
                    points in his tale.
          ON SHADOWS - The Four Generals thump forward.

                    He fails to discuss the petrified
                    agony of three thousand years.

                    body throughout centuries.

                               GENERAL AGUILA
                    So, while our great leader basked
                    in the warmth of the sun and the
                    glory of fresh air... we rotted in
                    the stone hell that lasted
                    throughout Wmillennia.

                    And now, our Master has tired of

                    loving his entire life. Of FEELING.

          Aguila walks to the cells. The portal writhes in the bg,
          sinking into the floor.

                              GENERAL AGUILA
                    But thanks to his cunning, his
                    technology, we are now capable of
                    LIVING... we have now become-
                        (close, creepy)
                    - gods.

                              GENERAL SERPIENTE
                    And we shall finish what we began
                    all those years ago. We will
                    finally have our victory.

                              GENERAL GATO
                    Even with one monster still free,
                    the curse can never be broken!

          Karai sees Winters' condition. Clearly getting screwed by the
          very beings who have been nothing but hostile toward her and
          her Foot Clan. She suddenly GESTURES WITH HER HANDS -
          military/ninja style.

                         It means we're going to help you.
               WIDER - 40 Foot Ninja disperse around out of the building,
               leaving Karai and 4 Foot Ninja behind.

                                   KARAI
                         My soldiers will find the
                         thirteenth monster. And you will
                         bring it back here. Hurry - we
                         don't have much time.
               Karai runs off. April looks over at Winters. He nods, still
               hurting. April takes off after Karai, leaving Casey behind
               with the Four Foot. They run out into the garden, just in
               time to see the other Foot disappear into the night.

               BACK ON GENERALS - They move toward Winters! The Turtles
               quickly look at one another. Know what they have to do.
               They all leap in the way, standing between Winters and his
               backstabbing Generals.
               Aguila moves forward to Leo. Raph steps in beside him,
               defiant. Then Mikey. Then Don.

               with all the exuberance and intensity they've ever had.
               Winters moves to help the Turtles.

               Donnie is paired with the General Mono. He uses his quick
               speed and expert staff against the hammer-weilding Statue.
               Leo fights with Gato. He can't dodge him. He's too fast. Leo

               shell-first into a large GLASS DISPLAY CASE filled with

                    My troops have located the final
                    monster. At the harbor docks.

                               ASEY
                    Oh, I got this one covered.
          Casey GUNS IT for the pier, music tinkling. CAM ZOOMS AHEAD
          THROUGH THE STREETS until it reaches the pier. CAM CRANES
          over the harbor warehouses until we see -
          - the 13th monster! Looks like a land-locked GIANT CROCODILE.
          It appears unconscious - a hundred or so TRANQ DARTS sticking
          out of it's back. The Van pulls onto the scene.

          I
           NSIDE THE VAN - Everyone is in shock. The ninjas look at
          each other.

                               ASEY
                    Huh. Now there's somethin' you
                    don't see every day...
          They pile out of the van.

                              CASEY
                        (off of monster)
                    Well, I guess we have to figure out
                    how to get handsome here back to
                    Winters' Tower.

                              KARAI
                    We should tie it to the van and
                    drag it back.

                              CASEY
                    Wow. You're... hard core.
          ON CREATURE - A Foot Ninja stands next to the lifeless body.
          As he turns his head he doesn't see THE CREATURE'S EYE OPEN!

          

                                                                  90.

          

          

          
          WIDER - The creature stands up as everyone turns to see. The
          creature DOG SHAKES his hide, sending the tranq darts flying
          everywhere! They slam into the walls like shrapnel.
          ON FOOT - As they dive out of the way. One gets hit with a
          dart in the chest. Looks down. Passes out.

                                CASEY
                    Incoming!
          ON VAN - As they open the doors to act as shields as - THUNKA
          THUNK THUNK - darts stick in the door!
          ON CREATURE - He's now standing... and dying to chase
          something. It GROWLS/SCREAMS as they all pile into the van!
          Casey immediately throws it in reverse and starts peeling
          back on the pier, barely staying out of the clutches of the
          creature smashing the pier in front of them. Get to the end
          and spin the vehicle around.

                              APRIL

                    FAST! GO FAST NOW!!!
          Casey guns it, the 12-foot creature mere inches away!
          STARS IN SKY - Karai sees the stars are slowly moving out of
          alignment. Losing time fast.
          BACK IN LOBBY - CRANE DOWN on Winters and Splinter. On the
          last full cell.
          ON PORTAL - A pair of LARGE EYES are threatening to come out.
          In the BG, dozens of winged DEMONS fly around inside.

                              LEONARDO
                    They better hurry with that last
                    monster!

                              RAPHAEL
                    I'm sure my man Casey's got it all
                    under control...

                              LEONARDO
                    That's what I'm afraid of.
          BACK WITH VAN - CLOSE ON CASEY'S FACE - As he's screaming his
          guts out.

                              CASEY

                    I GOTTA TELL YA... I'M, UH, I'M

                    STILL NOT SURE THAT THIS WAS THE

                    BEST IDEA!!!!
          WIDER - We see that he's on top of the Van, acting as LIVE
          BAIT to attract the creature! It's working too! The creature
          pounces along like an awkward greyhound run. April drives.

          

                              R

          

          

          

          

                                                                     91.

          

          

          
          Casey is throwing SPORTS EQUIPMENT at it from his large
          hockey bag. The creature is catching and eating it all.
          INSIDE VAN - Casey slips in.

                              APRIL
                    What are you doing in here?!

                              CASEY
                    Ran outta food.
          They all look out the back window as the creature pounds
          closer and closer...
          BACK IN LOBBY - The Turtles and Generals are at a standstill.
          Turtles all get thrown into a pile between the Generals.

                               APHAEL
                    Listen. I'm the last guy to sound
                    like a TV cartoon, but I think we
                    need to work together.

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    Teamwork. The more you know...
          Don clocks Mikey behind the head.

                              LEONARDO

                        (TEASING)
                    Why Raph, no solo act tonight?
          Raph grins. They stand, backs to back... finally as a TEAM.
          They trust one another, and their efficiency shows.
          ON PORTAL - More tentacles begin to come out. More claws
          surround the surface edges.
          ON TMNT - The music swells. The brothers act and think as
          one. The way they should. They way they will from now on.
          ON SPLINTER - As cam PUSHES IN, he stands up. Seeing his
          sons. As one. As BROTHERS. He smiles.

                              SPLINTER
                    Yes. Yes, my sons.
          The Generals can't keep up. It's enough to distract them to
          make mistakes the TMNT take advantage of.
          ON WINTERS - Sees the portal light beginning to SHRINK!
          Because of the TMNT's moves, the Generals are now on the
          precipice of the Portal, being pulled back. They struggle to
          stand.
          The brothers look at each other. The place is violent with a
          whirlwind and screaming Monsters.

          

          T

                                RAPHAEL
                      So who wants ta call it a day?

                                  LEONARDO
                      I'm in.

                                DONATELLO
                      Affirmative.

                                MICHAELANGELO
                      Roger dodger, dude.
          The   TMNT launch into their FINAL ATTACK - perfectly in synch
          and   take out each of the Generals, knocking them back into
          the   PORTAL! They're plucked out of mid-air by cloudy tendrils
          and   pulled back!
          The Turtles collapse onto the floor, back to the portal.
          Silent. Splinter runs over to them.

                                SPLINTER
                      My sons, I am so proud of you all.
          Then - BOOM! - the Generals' ARMS slam onto the ridge of the
          portal - BEGINNING TO CLIMB OUT! The Turtles jump back.

                                TURTLES

                      WAAAHHHHH/OHMIGOD!/WHOOAAA!!!

                                GENERAL AGUILA
                      Silly children. We are immortals
                      made of stone! The Earth has only
                      BEGUN to feel our wrath!
          The brothers are screwed. They can't stop the Generals. Until-
          BEHIND TURTLES - Glowing headlights grow larger. Closer. As -
          KERSMASH!!! The Van flies through the lobby, musical chime
          and all, being trailed by the Creature! April clips a corner
          as the vehicle spins out of the path.
           he Creature tries to stop, but can't on the marble floor. It
          falls, sliding, clicking its claws trying to stop!

                                  WINTERS

                      LOOK OUT!
          Winters dives in and pushes the Turtles out of way as the
          Creature flies in and knocks the Generals back into the
          Portal! The Cloud Tendrils grab a hold of it and pull it back
          into the Portal!
          ON STARS - The Stars move out of alignment, ending the cycle.
          ON PORTAL - It begins to close. The Generals struggle to get
          out, only now, we see they are HUMAN... their curse broken...
          and an eternity of pain and suffering ahead of them.

          

                                                                  93.

          

          

          
          Aguila tries to fight his way out of the portal.

                              GENERAL AGUILA

                    YOU CANNOT DEFEAT US! WE-
          WHAM! - Raph and Leo team-roundhouse him back into oblivion!

                              RAPHAEL
                    I thought he'd never shut up.
          WIDER - The portal EXPLODES in a upwards funnel. Silence.

                              MICHAELANGELO

                    HOLY CRAP!!!

                                 RAPHAEL

                    WE DID IT!

                              TURTLES

                    YEAH! WHOOHOO! WE DID IT!
          The brothers high five one another. Splinter smiles proud.
          ON VAN - Dusty and smoking. The door clangs open. Casey piles
          out. Karai comes next and accidentally FALLS on Casey in a
          very compromising position! She slyly smiles. April falls out
          last beside them.

                              CASEY
                        (caught - looks at both)
                    Oh. I, uh -
          HUHN! - Casey tosses Karai off of him. April's eye cocks.

                              APRIL
                    Don't try to tell me for one second
                    that you didn't enjoy tha-
          Casey just grabs her, cutting her off and they kiss. Like
          they should have been kissing all along.
          They stop. Noses close. Smile. They pull apart, revealing
          MIKEY standing there. Watching them all gooey-eyed.

                              MICHAELANGELO

                    AWWWWWW....
          Raph and Leo look at each other. A beat. Then hug. Brothers
          again. Dialogue would just ruin this moment.
          Splinter walks over to them. CAM ADJUSTS to show Karai and
          the Foot Ninja standing there. Silence. Finally, Karai steps
          forward -

                              KARAI
                    You are every bit the warriors I
                    was informed you were. You have
                    passed.

          

                                                                  94.

          

          

          
          ON TMNT - they're confused.

                              LEONARDO
                    Passed what?

                              RAPHAEL
                    You know us?

                              KARAI
                    I've known OF you for some time.
                        (beat, to Leo's question)
                    Savor your victory tonight. For
                    soon we will have further business
                    together.

                              SPLINTER
                    What kind of business?

                              KARAI
                    The kind that involves familiar
                    faces from your past...
          ON TURTLES - They all look at each other.

                              RAPHAEL
                    She doesn't mean...
          They look back - and see Karai and the Foot have DISAPPEARED.
          Raph looks over at WINTERS. He's hunched over in the corner.
          Can't tell what's going on. They walk over slowly.

                               RAPHAEL
                    Winters?
          ON WINTERS - Looks like he's sobbing. They get concerned.
          Then the sobs turn to LAUGHING. He stands up. His hand is
          spotted red with his M
                               own BLOOD from a cut on his cheek.

                               ICHAELANGELO
                    I'm never usually that happy to be
                    bleeding.

                              DONATELLO
                    You would be if you were an
                    immortal who couldn't bleed for
                    three thousand years...
          Winters looks at all the Turtles.

                              WINTERS
                    Thank you. Thank you from the
                    bottom of my heart. You've made a
                    very old man, very very happy.

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    So, um, what happens now?

          

                                    R

                ON WINTERS - He just SMILES. Content. Finally at peace. As he
                ages thousands of years in front of us... eventually turning
                to DUST and blowing away.

                                    MICHAELANGELO
                          Okay... just a little bit creepy.

                              (SNEEZES)
                          Oh gawd. I think he's in my n-n-

                          ATTCHOOOOO!! OH GROSS!!!
                CAM PULLS BACK, out of the building, onto the street. See the
                destruction. The clearing skies. THE SUNRISE.

                                                                    UT TO:

                Raph comes to Splinter's room.

                          Sit down, Raphael.

                                    RAPHAEL
                          Thank you, Master Splinter, for
                          your guidance.

                          I can only hope that one day, I
                          will be able to begin the next
                          stage of my training like Leo.
                Splinter smiles. Reaches into a box and takes out a similar
                MEDALLION to the one given to Leonardo.

                                     SPLINTER
                          That, my son, you already have.

                          Our training works in mysterious
                          ways. But the answer that lies in
                          all our questions... is family.
                Raph beams as he accepts the "badge". He excitedly stands up.
                Splinter looks to the hallway where his eyes meet Leo's. They
                exchange knowing smiles as Splinter winks and we-

                A ROCKIN' NUMBER PLAYS as we cap everyone's adventures.
                Splinter walks through the lair. It's empty. He walks past
                their "trophy room". He places the ornate head of WINTERS'
                CANE on the shelf.

                Mikey and Don are on the rooftops. Leo and Raph join them on

                hand. She leans forward.

                          So what makes a family? Personally,
                          it's more than sharing a roof or a
                          bathroom. It's sharing life... My
                          father taught me that, and I think
                          it's pretty much true... y'know,
                          provided that you don't kill each
                          other in the process. Or that no
                          one touches your stuff. Or makes
                          loud noises when you're trying to
                          sleep. Or...

                They run close to the camera, once again, a family.

                         "TOY STORY"

FADE IN:

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM

A row of moving boxes lie on the floor of the room.  They
are drawn up in crayon to look like a miniature Western town.
The bedroom is lined with cloud wallpaper giving the
impression of sky.

One of the boxes has a children's illustrated "WANTED"
poster of a Mr. Potato Head taped to it.

A MR. POTATO HEAD DOLL is set in front of the poster.  The
VOICE OVER of ANDY, a 6-year-old boy, can be heard acting
out all the voices of the scene.

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            Alright everyone, this is a stick-
            up!  Don't anybody move!  Now empty
            that safe!

A GROUP OF TOYS have been crowded together in front of the
"BANK" box.

Andy's hand lowers a CERAMIC PIGGY BANK in front of Mr.
Potato Head and shakes out a pile of coins to the floor.  Mr.
Potato Head kisses the coins.

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            Ooh!  Money.  Money.  Money.
                   (kissing noises)


A porcelain figurine of the shepherdess, BO PEEP, is brought
into the scene.

                         ANDY (AS BO PEEP)
            Stop it!  Stop it, you mean old
            potato!

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            Quiet Bo Peep, or your sheep get
            run over!

The companion porcelain sheep are placed in the center of a
Hot Wheels track loop.

                         ANDY (AS SHEEP)
            Heeeeelp!  BAAAAA!  Heeeelp us!

                         ANDY (AS BO PEEP)
            Oh, no!  Not my sheep!  Somebody do
            something!

WOODY, a pull-string doll cowboy, enters into the scene
opposite the inanimate spud.

Andy's hand pulls on the ring in the center of Woody's back.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            Reach for the sky.

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            Oh, no!  Sheriff Woody!!

                         ANDY (AS WOODY)
            I'm here to stop you, One-Eyed Bart.

Andy's hand pulls out one of Mr. Potato Head's eyes.

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            Doooooh!  How'd you know it was me!

                         ANDY (AS WOODY)
            Are you gonna come quietly?

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            You can't touch me Sheriff!  I
            brought my attack dog with a built-
            in force field!

Andy places a TOY DOG, with a SLINKY for a mid-section, in
front of Mr. Potato Head and stretches him out.

                         ANDY (AS WOODY)
            Well I brought my DINOSAUR, who
            eats force field dogs!!

Andy reveals a PLASTIC TYRANNOSAURUS REX, who stomps on the
Slinky Dog.

                         ANDY (AS DINOSAUR)
            AAAAR!  ROAR-ROAR-ROAR!

                         ANDY (AS SLINKY DOG)
            YIPE!  YIPE-YIPE-YIPE!

                         ANDY (AS WOODY)
            You're goin' to jail, Bart.

Andy picks up Mr. Potato Head and places him in a baby crib
in the room.

A cardboard sign is taped to the bars with the word "JAIL"
written in crayon.

                         ANDY (AS WOODY)
            Say good-bye to the wife and
            tatertots.

Andy's 1-year-old sister, MOLLY, crawls over and picks up Mr.
Potato Head.  She sucks on him for a beat then proceeds to
pound the toy repeatedly against the rail of her crib,
forcing some of his parts loose.

Andy, wearing a cowboy hat himself, picks up Woody off the
floor.

                         ANDY
                   (pulling Woody's string)
            You saved the day again, Woody.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            You're my favorite deputy.

BEGIN TITLES

SONG "YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND IN ME" plays while Andy does
various activities with Woody:

-- Andy turns the Western town boxes around to reveal cows
drawn on the other side.  He grabs a jump rope and pretends
Woody is lassoing the cattle.

                         ANDY
            C'mon, let's wrangle up the cattle.

-- Andy then rides Woody around on an RC (remote control)
car, and herds the remaining "cow" boxes under Molly's crib.

INT. STAIRWELL

-- Andy places Woody on the top of the stairwell banister
allowing the doll to slide downstairs.  Andy races ahead and
catches him at the bottom.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS LIVING ROOM

-- Andy & Woody fall into the La-Z-Boy chair and spin around
and around.

Next, Andy uses the La-Z-Boy foot rest as a catapult.

Andy flings Woody across the room to the sofa.

                         ANDY
                   (raising his arms)
            Score!

SONG ENDS

Woody lies limp on the sofa while Andy is heard talking to
his mother.

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Wow!  Cool!

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Whadda ya think?

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!

ANGLE: THE ADJOINING DINING ROOM

MRS. DAVIS, Andy's thirty eight-year-old mom, has just
finished decorating the area with streamers and balloons.  A
banner is draped across the archway.  It reads: "Happy
Birthday Andy."

Woody's frozen face stares in the direction of the birthday
decorations.

                         ANDY
            Can we leave this up 'til we move?

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Well, sure, we can leave it up.

                         ANDY
            Yeah!

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Now go get Molly.  Your friends are
            going to be here any minute.

                         ANDY
            Okay.

Andy picks up Woody from the couch and runs upstairs.

                         ANDY
            It's party time, Woody!

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Andy and Woody enter the room.  Molly is still banging
Potato Head against her crib railing.  Andy tips Woody's hat
at her.

                         ANDY
            Howdy, Little Lady!

He deposits Woody on the bed and pulls his string one last
time.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            Somebody's poisoned the waterhole.

                         ANDY
                   (picking up Molly)
            C'mon, Molly.  Oh, you're getting
            heavy!
                   (to Woody)
            See ya later, Woody.

Andy exits.

END TITLES

Woody's eyes come to life.  The cowboy doll sits up, his
expression changing from a smile to worry.

                         WOODY
                   (to himself)
            Pull my string!  The birthday
            party's today?!

Woody thinks.

                         WOODY
                   (to the room)
            Okay, everybody.  Coast is clear.

The bedroom comes alive.  TOYS emerge from the toy box, the
closet, the shelves, etc... in a flurry of activity.

POTATO HEAD, his body parts strewn across the floor, sits
himself upright and begins to re-assemble himself.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Ages three and up.  It's on my box.
            Ages three and up!  I'm not
            supposed to be babysitting Princess
            Drool.

HAMM, the piggy bank, flips one last penny into his coin
slot.  Potato Head walks up to him.  All his facial pieces
are in the wrong slots.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Hey, Hamm!  Look!  I'm Picasso!
                         HAMM
            I don't get it.

Hamm walks away.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            You uncultured swine!
                   (to someone O.S.)
            What are you looking at, ya hockey
            puck?!

Potato Head walks past, revealing a hockey puck figurine.

Woody sits on the edge of the bed observing all the activity.
He turns to a plastic green army man, SARGENT, standing on
the night stand.

                         WOODY
            Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?

                         SARGENT
                   (saluting)
            Sir!  No Sir!

                         WOODY
            Okay, thank you.  At ease.

Woody hops off the bed.

                         WOODY
            Hey, Slinky?

                         SLINKY (O.S.)
            Right here, Woody!

A toy Slinky dog, SLINKY, appears from under the bed pushing
out a checker board set.  He begins to place the checkers on
the board.

                         SLINKY
            I'm red this time.

                         WOODY
            No, Slink --

                         SLINKY
            Oh...well alright, you can be red
            if you want.

                         WOODY
            Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad
            news.

                         SLINKY
            Bad news?!

                         WOODY
            Sh-h-h-h-h!!

Woody covers up Slinky's mouth, aware that the other toys in
the room are watching.  He leans in close to Slinky.

                         WOODY
                   (whispering)
            Just gather everyone up for a staff
            meeting and be happy!!

                         SLINKY
            Got it.

Slinky shuffles off.

                         WOODY
            Be HAPPY!

Slinky perks up his gait and LAUGHS HARD.

Woody proceeds in the other direction.  He passes a toy
ROBOT and SNAKE partially hidden under the bedspread.

                         WOODY
                   (to the room)
            Staff meeting, everybody.
                   (aside)
            Snake, Robot -- podium duty.

Robot and Snake come out from under the bed and reluctantly
follow Woody.

Woody walks past an Etch-A-Sketch, ETCH, going the other
direction.

                         WOODY
            Hey Etch!  Draw!

Both Etch and Woody whip around like gunfighters.

Before Woody can fully extend his arm out, the Etch-A-Sketch
etches a gun on its screen.

                         WOODY
                   (pretending to be shot)
            Oh!! You got me again, Etch! You've
            been working on that draw.  Fastest
            knobs in the west.

Slinky passes a group of toys on the floor.

                         SLINKY
            Got a staff meeting, you guys, come
            on, let's go!

Robot and Snake begin constructing a podium made out of
Legos and a Tinker Toy tub while Woody searches the floor.

                         WOODY
            Now where is that -- ?  Aw, hey,
            who moved my doodle pad way over here?

Woody spots the doodle pad on the floor by the desk and
walks over to it.  As he reaches down to pick it up...

REX, the plastic dinosaur, jumps out to scare Woody.

                         REX
            ROOAAAARR!!!

                         WOODY
                   (unaffected)
            Oh, how ya doin', Rex?

Rex suddenly turns timid.

                         REX
            Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.

                         WOODY
            I was close to being scared that time.

Woody heads back to the podium.  Rex follows.

                         REX
            I'm going for fearsome here, but I
            just don't feel it.  I think I'm
            just coming off as annoying.

A crook suddenly grabs Woody's neck and jerks him towards BO
PEEP, the porcelain figurine.

                         WOODY
                   (choking)
            Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.

                         BO PEEP
            I wanted to thank you, Woody, for
            saving my flock.

                         WOODY
                   (blushing)
            Oh, hey - it was nothing.

                         BO PEEP
            Whadda ya say I get someone else to
            watch the sheep tonight?

                         WOODY
                   (very flustered)
            Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I...

Bo saunters back towards her lamp stand, passing a stack of
ABC blocks.

                         BO PEEP
            Remember, I'm just a couple of
            blocks away.

Woody is left lovestruck.

All the rest of the toys in the room are filing past Slinky.

                         SLINKY
            Come on, come on!  Smaller toys up
            front.

Woody remains lovestruck in the middle of the room.

                         SLINKY
            Hey, Woody!  C'mon!

Woody snaps out of his trance and rushes over to the podium.

The toys crowd together as Woody steps up to the podium.
MIKE, a toy tape recorder, waddles up next to Woody and
indicates his microphone.

                         MIKE
            Ahem!

                         WOODY
                   (grabbing microphone)
            Oh, thanks, Mike.
                   (to the crowd)
            Okay --

SFX: FEEDBACK

                         WOODY
                   (to Mike)
            Oh, whoa, step back --

Mike waddles back a step to stop the feedback.

                         WOODY
            Hello?  Check?  Better?  Great.
            Everybody hear me?  Up on the
            shelf, can you hear me?  Great!
            Okay, first item today...oh, yeah.
            Has everyone picked a moving buddy?

The toys all MOAN.

                         HAMM
            Moving buddy?!  You can't be serious!

                         REX
            Well I didn't know we were supposed
            to have one already.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
                   (waving his arm out
                   its socket)
            Do we have to hold hands?

The toys LAUGH and SNICKER.

                         WOODY
            Oh, yeah, you guys think this is a
            big joke.  We've only got one week
            left before the move.  I don't want
            any toys left behind.  A moving
            buddy -- if you don't have one, get
            one!
                   (checking the pad)
            Alright, next...uh...oh, yes.
            Tuesday night's "Plastic Corrosion
            Awareness" meeting was, I think, a
            big success and we want to thank Mr.
            Spell for putting that on for us.
            Thank you, Mr. Spell.

The words "You're welcome" scroll across Mr. Spell's display
screen as he speaks.

                         MR. SPELL
            You're welcome.

                         WOODY
            Ok, uh...oh yes.  One minor note
            here...
                   (under his breath)
            Andy's birthday party's been moved
            to today.
                   (full voice)
            Next we have --

The toys all PANIC.

                         REX
            What?!  Whadda ya mean, the party's
            today?!  His birthday's not 'til
            next week!!

                         HAMM
            What's going on down there?  Is Mom
            losing her marbles?!

                         WOODY
            Well, obviously she wanted to have
            the party before the move.  I'm not
            worried.  You shouldn't be worried.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Of course Woody ain't worried!
            He's been Andy's favorite since
            kindergarten!

                         SLINKY
            Hey, hey!  Come on, Potato Head!
            If Woody says it's all right, then,
            well, darnit, it's good enough for
            me.  Woody has never steered us
            wrong before.

While Slinky speaks, Potato Head takes off his mouth and
mimes kissing his own butt.

                         WOODY
            C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and
            birthday we go through this.

                         REX
            But what if Andy gets another
            dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just
            don't think I can take that kind of
            rejection.

                         WOODY
            Hey, listen, no one's getting
            replaced.  This is Andy we're
            talking about.

Woody steps down from the podium and walks towards the crowd.

                         WOODY
                   (continued)
            It doesn't matter how much we're
            played with.  What matters is that
            we're here for Andy when he needs
            us.  That's what we're made for.
            Right?
Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.

                         HAMM
            Pardon me.  I hate to break up the
            staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE!
            Birthday guests at three o'clock!

                         WOODY
            Stay calm, everyone!!

Too late.  The toys PANIC and stampede over Woody towards
the bedroom window, leaving him alone on the floor.

                         WOODY
            Uh, meeting adjourned.

The toys all crowd around the bedroom window, trying to get
a peek outside.

                         HAMM
            Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at
            all those presents?!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            I can't see a thing!

Unable to see over the crowd, Potato Head pulls his eyes out
of his head and holds them up over the other toys.

ANGLE: TOY'S POV OF ANDY'S FRONT YARD

CHILDREN file towards the front door carrying presents.

                         HAMM
            Yessir, we're next month's garage
            sale fodder for sure.

                         REX
                   (panicked)
            Any dinosaur-shaped ones?

                         HAMM
            Ah, for crying out loud, they're
            all in boxes, you idiot!

The presents keep coming.

                         REX
            They're getting bigger.

                         SLINKY
            Wait!  There's a nice little one
            over there!

At first, the kid's present appears to be a little box, but
then the kid turns -- the present is four feet long.  The
toys SCREAM.

                         MR. SPELL
            Spell the word "trashcan."

                         REX
            We're doomed!

Down on the floor, Woody smacks his hand to his forehead in
surrender.

                         WOODY
            Alright!  Alright!

The toys turn inside and look down at Woody.

                         WOODY
                   (continued)
            If I send out the troops, will you
            all calm down?

                         REX
            Yes!  Yes!  We promise!

                         WOODY
            Okay, save your batteries!

                         HAMM
            Eh, very good, Woody.  That's using
            the old noodle.

Woody jumps up onto Andy's bed and turns to the Sargent on
the nightstand.

                         WOODY
            Sargent.  Establish a recon post
            downstairs.  Code red.  You know
            what to do.

                         SARGENT
            Yes SIR!

The green army man hops down to the floor where a "BUCKET O'
SOLDIERS" sits.

                         SARGENT
            Alright men, you heard him.  Code
            Red!  Repeat: We are at Code Red!
            Recon plan Charlie.  Execute!
            Let's move move move!!

THE GREEN ARMY MEN file out of the bucket and march in
formation across the bedroom floor.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Andy's door creaks open and a lone army man ventures forth
to make sure the coast is clear.  Satisfied, he motions for
the others to proceed.  Squads of soldiers march into the
hall carrying a baby monitor and a jump rope.

The army men each leapfrog behind the stairway banisters and
hold their positions while the Sargent surveys the scene
below through his binoculars.

ANGLE: SARGENT'S BINOCULAR VIEW OF DOWNSTAIRS

Directly below, Mrs. Davis passes through the hallway
rounding up Andy and all his birthday guests.

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Okay, c'mon kids!  Everyone in the
            living room.  It's almost time for
            the presents.

Once Mrs. Davis and the children are out of sight, the
Sargent motions to his men with a silent hand signal.

TWO PARATROOPERS jump out through the railing, parachuting
down to the floor below.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

The paratroopers sweep the area with their plastic rifles,
then give the "all clear" sign.

The jump rope is lowered, and more soldiers rappel down.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM

The toys race towards the nightstand where Woody has placed
the receiving half of the baby monitor.

                         WOODY
            And this --
                   (turning on the baby monitor)
            -- is how we find out what is in
            those presents.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY

The green army men march in formation across the floor when
suddenly...

SFX: FOOTSTEPS

Can be heard approaching from behind the connecting kitchen
door.  Immediately the Sargent signals for his men to freeze
in their various classic action poses.

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Okay, who's hungry?  Here come the
            chips.  I've got Cool Ranch and
            Barbeque --

The door opens and Mrs. Davis' foot comes down hard on top
of a soldier.

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Owww!  What in the world -- ?  Oh,
            I thought I told him to pick these up.

With a sweep of her foot, she brushes the army men out of
her path and continues on to the living room.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM

                         REX
            Shouldn't they be there by now?
            What's taking them so long?!

                         WOODY
            Hey, these guys are professionals.
            They're the best.  C'mon, they're
            not lying down on the job.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY

As soon as Mom is gone, the Sargent motions for his men to
proceed toward a nearby houseplant that looks into the
living room.

The Sargent then notices an injured soldier struggling to
drag himself forward -- a casualty of Mrs. Davis' foot.  The
Sargent helps the injured soldier to his feet.

                         WOUNDED SOLDIER
                   (moans)
            Go on without me.  Just go!

                         SLINKY
            A good soldier never leaves a man
            behind.

The Sargent motions to the remaining men above.  They lower
themselves via jump rope, riding the baby monitor.  Once
downstairs, they hustle the baby monitor towards the
houseplant.  Suddenly...

A BALL

bounces into the hallway, followed by the sound of footsteps
and kid clamor.

The Sargent, supporting his wounded man, reaches the plant,
right on the heels of the squad with the baby monitor.  They
conceal themselves in the house plant just before the
children run by.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS - HOUSE PLANT - CONTINUOUS

While the baby monitor is set in place, A MEDIC evaluates
the wounded soldier and gives the "thumb's up" signal.

The Sargent scans the party with his binoculars.

ANGLE: BINOCULAR VIEW OF BIRTHDAY PRESENTS

The pile of brightly wrapped gifts sits atop the living room
coffee table.

                         SARGENT (O.S.)
            There they are.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM

The toys perk up as STATIC suddenly emits from the baby
monitor.

                         SARGENT (O.S.)
                   (over monitor)
            Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha
            Bravo.

                         WOODY
            This is it!  This is it!  Quiet,
            quiet, quiet!

                         SARGENT (O.S.)
                   (over monitor)
            Come in, Mother Bird.
            Alright...Andy's opening the first
            present now.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
                   (chanting)

            A lunchbox...?!

                         SLINKY

            Ok, second present...it appears to
            be...okay, it's bed sheets.

The toys CHEER WITH RELIEF.

                         HAMM
            Yeah, alright!!

Hamm gives Potato Head a congratulatory pat on the back,
sending his facial features flying.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Hey, watch it!

                         SLINKY
            I knew you were right all along,
            Woody.  Never doubted you for a

INT. DOWNSTAIRS - HOUSE PLANT

The platoon is preparing to exit the plant when...

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Wait a minute.  Oooh, what do we
            have here?!

The Sargent lifts his binoculars back to his eyes.

ANGLE: BINOCULAR VIEW OF LIVING ROOM

Mrs. Davis can be seen opening the closet and pulling out
another large present.

                         SARGENT

            Mother Bird.

All the toys tense up.

                   (continued)
            Mom has pulled a surprise present
            from the closet.  Andy's opening it...

            ...it's...it's a --

The sound of children CHEERING emits from the monitor,
cutting off the Sargent.

                         REX
            It's a WHAT?! WHAT IS IT?!!!

Rex grabs a leg of the nightstand and shakes it, making the
monitor drop to the floor.  The impact causes the batteries
to roll out.

                         REX
            Oh, no!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Oh, ya big lizard!  Now we'll never
            know what it is!

                         HAMM
                   (sarcastic)
            Way to go, Rex.

Everyone rushes to the fallen monitor.  Potato Head tries to
correctly insert the batteries.

                         WOODY
            No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em
            around!

                         HAMM
            Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!

                         WOODY
            Plus is positive, minus is negative!
            Oh, let me!

Woody jumps down off the bed and shoves both Hamm and Potato
Head aside.

                   (into the monitor)
            RED ALERT!  RED ALERT!  ANDY IS

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Woody puts the last battery back in.

                         WOODY
            There.

                         SARGENT (O.S.)

            Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat!

            Andy's coming, everybody!  Back to
            your places.  Hurry!

The toys PANIC and scatter about the room.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear?
            Did you see my ear?

                         REX
            Outta my way!  Here I come, here I
            come --

Frantic, Rex slams into a trashcan and falls over.

Everyone scurries to their places as the KIDS' FOOTSTEPS
grow louder.

Woody falls limp in his spot on the bed just as...

Andy's bedroom door flies open and a flood of children's
feet rush in.

                         FRIEND #1
            Hey, look!  His lasers light up.
                         ANDY
            Take that, Zurg!

Woody is flung off Andy's pillow and slides, unnoticed, down
the gap between the bed and the back wall.

                         FRIEND #2
            Quick!  Make a space!  This is
            where the spaceship lands.

                         ANDY
            -- and you press his back and he
            does a karate-chop action!

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Come on down, guys.  It's time for
            games!  We've got prizes!

                         ANDY
            Oh, yeah!

The kids all run out as fast as they entered, SLAMMING THE
DOOR behind them.

BEAT

The toys slowly come to life and make their way toward the bed.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            What is it?

                         BO PEEP
            Can you see it?

                         SLINKY
            What the heck is up there?

                         REX
            Woody?  Who's up there with you?

Woody crawls out from under the bed.  The toys are shocked
to discover him there.

                         SLINKY
            Woody, what are you doing under the
            bed?

                         WOODY
                   (composing himself)
            Uh-h-h-h...nothing!  Uh, nothing.
            I'm sure Andy was just a little
            excited, that's all.  Too much cake
            and ice cream, I suppose.  It's
            just a mistake.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in
            your spot, Woody.

                         REX
                   (GASP!)
            Have you been replaced?

                         WOODY
            Hey!  What did I tell you earlier?
            No one is getting replaced.

The toys give each other a look of doubt.

                         WOODY
            Now let's all be polite, and give
            whatever it is up there a nice, big
            "Andy's Room" welcome.

Woody climbs slowly up the side of the bed, peeking over the
edge.  His eyes widen at the sight of...

BUZZ LIGHTYEAR

We see Buzz as Woody does - an expensive looking space age
action figure, covered with buttons and stickers from head
to toe.  The imposing "G.I. Joe-sized" doll stands heroically
in the center of the bed, his back to Woody.

Woody GULPS.

Buzz comes alive and looks around.

ANGLE: BUZZ'S POV THROUGH HIS HELMET

While he scans the bedroom a "DARTH VADER" LIKE BREATHING is
heard.

Buzz eyes it all suspiciously and pushes a button on his chest.

SFX: ELECTRONIC BEEP

                         BUZZ
            Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.
            Come in, Star Command.

Nothing.  He pushes the button again.

                         BUZZ
            Star Command - come in.  Do you
            read me?
                   (to himself)
            Why don't they answer?!!
Just then, Buzz catches sight of his ripped packaging.  The
box is designed to look like a spaceship.

                         BUZZ
                   (GASP)
            My ship!!

He runs up to the box and investigates the damage.

                         BUZZ
            Blast!  This'll take weeks to repair!

Buzz flips open a plastic compartment on his arm -- his
wrist communicator.

                         BUZZ
            Buzz Lightyear Mission Log.
            Stardate 4072: My ship has run off
            course en route to sector 12.  I've
            crash landed on a strange planet.
            The impact must have awoken me from
            hyper-sleep.

Buzz springs up and down on the squishy surface of the bed.

                         BUZZ
                   (into communicator)
            Terrain seems a bit unstable...

He taps the sticker of controls on his wrist communicator.

                         BUZZ
                   (into communicator)
            No read-out yet if the air is
            breathable... and there seems to be
            no sign of intelligent life
            anywhere --

ANGLE: BUZZ'S POV THROUGH HIS HELMET

Woody's face suddenly pops into view.

                         WOODY
            Hello-o-o...

                         BUZZ
            HO-YAAAHH!!!

Buzz jumps back, taking a fighting stance.  He presses a
button on his arm that turns on a red "laser beam" light on
his wrist.  Buzz aims the red beam on Woody's forehead and
holds it there.

                         WOODY
            Aaaaaaah!  Whoa, hey, whoa, did I
            frighten you?  Didn't mean to.
            Sorry.  Howdy!  My name is Woody
            and this is Andy's room.  That's
            all I wanted to say, and also,
            there has been a bit of a mix-up.
            This is my spot, see, the bed here --

While Woody is speaking, Buzz notices the sheriff's badge on
Woody's vest.

                         BUZZ
                   (de-activating his
                   laser beam)
            Local law enforcement!  It's about
            time you got here.  I'm Buzz
            Lightyear, Space Ranger, Universe
            Protection Unit.  My ship has crash
            landed here by mistake.

Buzz begins walking around the bed, surveying the situation.
Woody tries to keep up.

                         WOODY
            Yes, it is a mistake, because, you
            see, the bed, here, is my spot.

                         BUZZ
            I need to repair my turbo boosters.
            Do you people still use fossil
            fuels, or have you discovered
            crystalic fusion?

                         WOODY
            Well, let's see, we've got double
            A's --

                         BUZZ
            Watch yourself!!

Buzz shoves Woody down on the bed and re-activates his wrist
laser.

                         BUZZ
                   (continued)
            Halt!  Who goes there?!

The other toys are peeking over the edge of the bed.

                         REX
            Don't shoot!  It's okay!  Friends!

                         BUZZ
                   (to Woody)
            Do you know these life forms?

                         WOODY
            Yes.  They're Andy's toys.

                         BUZZ
            Alright, everyone.  You're clear to
            come up.

Buzz walks over to the toys.

                         BUZZ
            I am Buzz Lightyear.  I come in peace.

Rex steps forward and eagerly shakes Buzz's hand.

                         REX
            Oh, I'm so glad you're not a dinosaur!

                         BUZZ
            Why, thank you...
                   (pulls away)
            Now thank you all for your kind
            welcome.

                         REX
            Say!  What's that button do?

                         BUZZ
            I'll show you.

Buzz presses a button on his chest.

                         BUZZ (SAMPLED VOICE)
            Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

The toys all GASP IN AWE.

                         SLINKY
            Hey, Woody's got something like
            that.  His is a pullstring, only
            it --

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Only it sounds like a car ran over it.

                         HAMM
            Oh yeah, but not like this one.
            This is a quality sound system.
            Probably all copper wiring, huh?
            So, uh, where are you from?
            Singapore?  Hong Kong?

                         BUZZ
            Well...no, actually I'm stationed
            up in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector
            4.  As a member of the elite
            Universe Protection Unit of the
            Space Ranger Corps, I protect the
            galaxy from the threat of invasion
            from the Evil Emperor Zurg, sworn
            enemy of the Galactic Alliance.

As Buzz speaks, Woody glances down at the box in which Buzz
arrived.

ANGLE: BACK OF BUZZ'S BOX

There is a cartoon drawing of Buzz giving the exact, word-
for-word spiel that Buzz is now giving.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Oh, really?  I'm from Playskool.

                         REX
            And I'm from Mattel.  Well, I'm not
            actually  from Mattel, I'm actually
            from a smaller company that was
            purchased in a leveraged buy-out.
            Well, I don't really understand the
            financials, but...

Woody walks over to Bo Peep.

                         WOODY
            You'd think they've never seen a
            new toy before.

                         BO PEEP
            Well sure, look at him.  He's got
            more gadgets on him then a Swiss
            army knife.

Slinky presses the button on Buzz's arm, activating his
laser light.  Buzz quickly pulls his arm away.

                         BUZZ
            Ah, ah, ah, please be careful!  You
            don't want to be in the way when my
            laser goes off.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Hey, a laser!  How come you don't
            have a laser, Woody?

                         WOODY
            It's not a laser!  It's a little
            lightbulb that blinks!

                         HAMM
            What's with him?

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Laser-envy.

                         WOODY
            All right, that's enough.  Look,
            we're all very impressed with
            Andy's new toy --

                         BUZZ
            Toy?

                         WOODY
            T-O-Y.  Toy.

                         BUZZ
            Excuse me, I think the word you're
            searching for is Space Ranger.

                         WOODY
            The word I'm searching for I can't
            say because there's pre-school toys
            present.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?

                         REX
            Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear?  Now I'm
            curious.  What does a Space Ranger
            actually do?

                         WOODY
            He's not a Space Ranger!  He
            doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers
            or fly --

                         BUZZ
            Excuse me.

Buzz calmly hits a button and wings pop out.

Again the toys GASP IN AWE.

                         HAMM
            Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!

                         WOODY
            Oh, what?!...What?!  These are
            plastic.  He can't fly!

                         BUZZ
            They are a terillium-carbonic alloy
            and I CAN fly.

                         WOODY
            No, you can't.

                         BUZZ
            Yes, I can.

                         WOODY
            You can't!

                         BUZZ
            Can!

                         WOODY
            Can't!  Can't!  Can't!

                         BUZZ
            I tell you, I could fly around this
            room with my eyes closed!

                         WOODY
            Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.

                         BUZZ
            All right, then, I will.
                   (to toys)
            Stand back everyone!

The crowd of toys make room for Buzz as he heads towards the
edge of the bed and climbs up the bedpost.  He poses like a
high diver, shuts his eyes...

                         BUZZ
            To infinity and beyond!!

...and leaps off the bed.

Buzz plummets straight down, hits a big rubber ball and
bounces right back up.

He then lands on a Hotwheels car, which races him down the
track, through the loop, and off a ramp.  Buzz soars upward
into a plane mobile hanging from the ceiling.

Buzz becomes wedged between the plane's wheels.  The impact
turns on the PLANE'S MOTOR making it (and Buzz) spin around
and around.

All the other toys watch from the bed, mesmerized.

Finally the centrifugal force causes Buzz to separate from
the plane, sailing him across the room toward the bed.

Buzz makes a perfect landing right in front of Woody and
then opens his eyes.

                         BUZZ
            Can.

The crowd of toys rush Buzz, CHEERING AND CLAPPING WITH
ADORATION.

                         REX
            Whoa!  Oh, wow!  You flew
            magnificently!

                         BO PEEP
            I found my moving buddy!

                         BUZZ
            Why, thank you.  Thank you all.
            Thank you.

                         WOODY
            That wasn't flying!  That was
            falling with style!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Man, the dolls must really go for
            you!
                   (aside)
            Can you teach me that?

Woody stands alone at the other end of the bed, fuming.
Slinky, caught up in the euphoria, approaches Woody.

                         SLINKY
            Heh, heh, heh!  Golly bob howdy --

                         WOODY
            Oh, shut up!  In a couple of days,
            everything will be just the way it
            was.  They'll see... they'll see.
            I'm still Andy's favorite toy.

MONTAGE

SONG: STRANGE THINGS plays over montage.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - LATER

A) Andy plays with Woody: jumping up and down on the bed,
running around the room.

B) Andy sets Woody down on the floor.  Next he "lands" Buzz
Lightyear on the floor opposite Woody.  Andy shoots Buzz's
laser at Woody and then smacks Woody across the room as if
he'd been blown away by the laser.

C) Andy runs into his closet wearing his cowboy hat and
cowboy pajamas.

                                            MATCH CUT TO:

Andy runs out of the closet clad in Buzz Lightyear pajamas
and a homemade spaceman's helmet.

                         ANDY
            Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.

D) Woody observes all the cowboy-themed items in the bedroom
transform to space motif: the posters, the drawings on the
wall, the pillow, the bedspread.

E) Buzz watches Rex execute a WIMPY ROAR.  The space ranger
suggests a few tips for the dinosaur.  Rex tries again, this
time giving a "JURASSIC PARK" ROAR.

The roar blasts Potato Head's features right off his face.

F) Woody passes Etch-A-Sketch, who's sporting a portrait of
Buzz.

Woody looks across the room to see Buzz combing Troll Doll's
hair, chatting away like a hair dresser.

Woody angrily shakes Etch, removing Buzz's image.

G) Rocky, Snake, Troll Doll and Rex are lifting Tinkertoys
as weights.  Buzz works out on top of an upside down Robot,
using his feet as a treadmill.

Potato Head attempts to lift his Tinkertoy barbell but ends
up tumbling backwards, leaving his arms connected to the
barbell.

H) Woody looks under the bed for Slinky, finding only the
checkerboard.

Woody peeks around the corner of the bed to see Slinky and
Robot, under Buzz's direction, setting Buzz's "ship" up on
top of ABC blocks for repair.

In frustration, Woody kicks the checkerboard, sending the
pieces flying.  One of the checkers ricochets off the
dresser and boomerangs into Woody's mouth.

I) On Andy's bed, Buzz pets Slinky whose back end is
stretched over to the other side where Woody sits.  Slinky's
wagging tail whacks Woody in the face repeatedly.

Woody shoves Slinky's rear end off the bed, leaving his
front end no choice but to eventually follow.

J) At bedtime, Andy loads his toys into the toybox until
just Woody and Buzz are left.  He deliberates as to which
toy to keep and which to toss into the toybox.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Andy is sound asleep, with Buzz tucked under the covers next
to him.

Woody peeks out at them from the toybox and then sadly sinks
back into the box, closing the lid to...

BLACK

END MONTAGE/SONG ENDS

The black screen splits horizontally to become...

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - MORNING - WOODY'S POV OF THE BEDROOM
FROM THE TOY BOX

All is clear -- no sign of Andy.  Woody throws open the lid
of the toy box.

                         WOODY
            Finally!

He takes a couple DEEP BREATHS of fresh air, then discovers
that his hat is missing.

                         WOODY
                   (looking back into
                   the toy box)
            Hey!  Who's got my hat?

The rubber shark pops up wearing Woody's cowboy hat.

                         SHARK
            Look, I'm Woody.  Howdy, howdy, howdy!

                         WOODY
                   (sarcastic)
            Ah-hah!  Ah-hah-hah!
                   (grabs the hat)
            Give me that!

Woody leaps out of the toy box.

                         BUZZ (O.S.)
            Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog.
            Let me show you something.  It
            looks as though I've been accepted
            into your culture.

Woody looks up to see Buzz chatting with Rex and Slinky.

                         BUZZ
                   (continued)
            Your Chief, Andy, inscribed his
            name on me.

Buzz puts his foot out so that Slinky and Rex can see the
sole of his boot.

The name "ANDY" is written on it in permanent marker.

                         SLINKY & REX
            Wow!

                         REX
            With permanent ink, too!

                         BUZZ
            Well, I must get back to repairing
            my ship.

Buzz walks away.

Woody looks at HIS foot -- "Andy" is written on it also but
in a much more childish scrawl, and is largely faded.

                         BO PEEP (O.S.)
            Don't let it get to you, Woody.

Hearing Bo, Woody puts his foot back down and quickly
straightens up.

                         WOODY
                   (nonchalant)
            Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what
            do you mean?  Who?

                         BO PEEP
            I know Andy's excited about Buzz,
            but you know, he'll always have a
            special place for you.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
                   (walking past)
            Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...

                         WOODY
            Alright!  That's it!

Woody angrily marches across the room.

Across the room, Buzz's cardboard ship is still up on the
ABC blocks.  Buzz lies down on a skateboard and slides under
the ship like a mechanic.  Snake and Robot stand by waiting
for instructions.  Buzz's hand reaches out from under the ship.

                         BUZZ
            Unidirectional bonding strip.

Robot turns towards Snake who stands in readiness by a tape
dispenser.

                         ROBOT
            Mr. Lightyear wants more tape!

Snake rips off a piece of tape with his mouth.

Woody approaches the skateboard, grabs hold of Buzz's foot
and rolls him out from under the ship.

                         WOODY
            Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away
            from Andy.  He's mine, and no one
            is taking him away from me.

                         BUZZ
            What are you talking about?
                   (to Robot)
            Where's that bonding strip?!

Buzz rolls himself back under.  Woody rolls him out again.

                         WOODY
            And another thing.  Stop with this
            spaceman thing.  It's getting on my
            nerves.

                         BUZZ
            Are you saying you want to lodge a
            complaint with Star Command?
                         WOODY
            Oh okay, so you want to do it the
            hard way, huh?

Buzz stands up, face to face with Woody.

                         BUZZ
            Don't even think about it, cowboy!

                         WOODY
            Oh, yeah, tough guy?!

Woody pushes Buzz in the chest, accidentally activating a
button that makes the spaceman's helmet open.

Buzz grabs his neck, GASPING FOR AIR.  He drops to his knees
and begins to writhe on the ground, holding his breath.

Woody is unsure how to react.

Suddenly, Buzz SNIFFS the air.

                         BUZZ
            The air isn't toxic.

Buzz rises and points an accusing finger at Woody.

                         BUZZ
            How dare you open a spaceman's
            helmet on an uncharted planet!  My
            eyeballs could've been sucked from
            their sockets!

Buzz closes his helmet.

                         WOODY
            You actually think you're THE "Buzz
            Lightyear?" Oh, all this time I
            thought it was an act!
                   (to the room)
            Hey, guys!  Look!  It's the REAL
            Buzz Lightyear!

                         BUZZ
            You're mocking me, aren't you?

                         WOODY
            Oh, no, no, no...
                   (pointing behind Buzz)
            Buzz, look!  An alien!

                         BUZZ
            Where?

Buzz falls for the trick and turns around.

Woody kneels over with LAUGHTER.

SFX: DOG BARKING

Woody stops short.  All the toys look to the bedroom window.

                         SID (O.S.)
            Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...

                         WOODY
            Uh-oh.

Slinky hides under the bed.

                         SLINKY
            It's Sid!

                         REX
            I thought he was at summer camp!

                         HAMM
            They must have kicked him out early
            this year.

The toys rush over to the window.

                         REX
            Oh, no!  Not Sid!

                         SID (O.S.)
            ...Incoming!

From out the window, SID PHILLIPS, a hyperactive ten-year-
old, and his dog, SCUD, can be roughly made out jumping
around in their backyard.

A tiny figure stands isolated in the center of the yard.
Sid pummels the figure with rocks while Scud strains at his
leash, barking wildly.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Who is it this time?

                         WOODY
            I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?

                         LENNY (O.S.)
            Right here, Woody.

Woody turns to see, LENNY, a pair of wind-up binoculars,
approaching him from the other end of the desk.  Woody picks
Lenny up and looks through him to survey the scene.

                         REX
            Oh, no.  I can't bear to watch one
            of these again!

ANGLE: BINOCULAR VIEW OF SID'S BACKYARD

A full size toy soldier is posed in a running stance in the
center of the backyard.  A huge M-80 is strapped to the
doll's back with masking tape.

                         WOODY
            Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.

                         SID (O.S.)
                   (plays under the next
                   5 lines)
            Just stay where you are, Corporal!
            Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up.
            I know you're tired!  I know your
            leg is cramping, but you can't move.
            Do you hear me?

Buzz breaks through the crowd.

                         BUZZ
            What's going on?

                         WOODY
            Nothing that concerns you spacemen.
            Just us TOYS.

                         BUZZ
            I'd better take a look anyway.

Buzz grabs Lenny from Woody and looks through him.

                         BUZZ
            Why is that soldier strapped to an
            explosive device?

                         WOODY
                   (redirecting Buzz's view)
            That's why.  Sid.

ANGLE: BINOCULAR VIEW OF THE DOG, SCUD

                         BUZZ
            Sure is a hairy fellah.

                         WOODY
            No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!

Again, Woody readjusts Buzz's view.

ANGLE: BINOCULAR VIEW OF SID

He is sporting a skull t-shirt and LAUGHING HIDEOUSLY.

                         WOODY
            THAT is Sid!

                         BUZZ
            You mean that happy child?

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            That ain't no happy child.

                         REX
            He tortures toys -- just for fun.

                         BUZZ
            Well, then we've got to do something!

Buzz steps up onto the window ledge.  The toys GASP IN SHOCK.

                         BO PEEP
            What are you doing?!!  Get down
            from there!

                         BUZZ
            I'm going to go teach that boy a
            lesson.

                         WOODY
            Yeah, sure.  You go ahead.  Melt
            him with your scary laser.

Woody presses Buzz's laser button.  It emits a WIMPY
ELECTRONIC BEEP.  Buzz quickly pulls his arm away.

                         BUZZ
            Be careful with that, it's
            extremely dangerous.

While Woody and Buzz banter, Lenny witnesses Sid lighting
the fuse of the M80.

                         LENNY
            He's lighting it!  He's lighting it!

                         SID (O.S.)
            NO-O-O-O-O!!!  CA-A-A-A-A-ARL!

                         LENNY
            Hit the dirt!

The toys jump away from the window.

SFX: EXPLOSION

Dirt clouds and toy shrapnel rain down along the side of
Andy's house.

                         SID (O.S.)
            Yes!  He's gone!  He's history!

Andy's toys peek over the window sill.

ANGLE: SID'S YARD

A large black scorch mark is all that remains where Combat
Carl once stood.  Sid jumps up and down victoriously while
Scud resumes his BARKING.

                         BUZZ
            I could have stopped him.

                         WOODY
            Buzz, I would love to see you try.
                   (gesturing to Sid's yard)
            'Course I'd love to see you as a
            crater.

Sid CACKLES and dances around the crater.

                         BO PEEP
            The sooner we move the better.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. ANDY'S FRONT YARD - SUNSET

A "FOR SALE" real estate sign stands in the front yard.
Another sign reading "SOLD" hangs from the bottom.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALL/ANDY'S BEDROOM

Mom opens the door to Andy's room and steps in.  The room is
full of packing boxes, most of them half full.  Andy is
playing with Woody and Buzz.

                         ANDY
            To infinity and beyond!

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Oh, all this packing makes me
            hungry.  What would you say to
            dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?

                         ANDY
            Pizza Planet?!  Oh, cool!

Andy throws the two toys on his desk with Buzz landing right
on top of Woody.

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Go wash your hands and I'll get
            Molly ready.

The minute the door is closed Woody comes alive and shoves
Buzz off of him.

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Can I bring some toys?

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            You can bring ONE toy...

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Just one?

Woody perks up with concern.

                         WOODY
                   (to himself)
            One toy?

He glances over his shoulder at Buzz, who is walking away
towards the opposite end of the desk.

Woody picks up a Magic 8 Ball left beside him on the desk.
With his back to Buzz, Woody quietly shakes the 8 ball.

                         WOODY
                   (whispering)
            Will Andy pick me?

He tips the 8 ball over.  The triangular oracle floats up to
the surface.  Its prediction reads: DON'T COUNT ON IT.

                         WOODY
            Don't count on it?!!  Doh-h-h-h!

Woody throws down the 8 ball in disgust.  It rolls across
the desk and falls behind it with a LOUD THUD.

Woody suddenly becomes interested in the back of the desk
and peers down it.

ANGLE: BACK OF THE DESK

The 8 ball is wedged way down near the bottom.  The space is
a black chasm, dark and deep, just big enough to fit...a toy.

Woody looks across the desk at Buzz.

He is HUMMING TO HIMSELF as he forages through Andy's
pen/pencil tray looking for "tools" to repair his ship with.
Right behind Buzz sits

THE RC CAR

It rests on the desktop, pointing in the direction where the
8 ball fell, with the remote laying by its side.

Woody smiles for a beat and then runs in a panic over to Buzz.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!!
            Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness!
            We've got trouble!

                         BUZZ
            Trouble?!
                   (looking around)
            Where?!

                         WOODY
                   (pointing to the back
                   of the desk)
            Down there.  Just down there.  A
            helpless toy...it's...it's trapped,
            Buzz!

                         BUZZ
            Then we've no time to lose!!

Buzz runs over and looks down the back of the desk.

                         BUZZ
            I don't see anything!

Woody picks up the remote for the RC Car and switches it on.
RC's eyes (headlights) open sleepily.

                         WOODY
            Oh, he's there.  Just, just keep
            looking.

Woody hits the "FORWARD" button on the remote and steers the
RC Car straight for Buzz.

                         BUZZ
            What kind of a toy -- ?

Buzz turns to see RC headed straight for him.  He dives out
of the way as the RC Car SMASHES into the base of...

A BULLETIN BOARD

The impact forces pushpins to fly out of the board.  Buzz
ducks as pins land all around him, sticking into the desk
like arrows.

POTATO HEAD

sits on the floor in the midst of a card game with Hamm.

He looks up at the desk and GASPS as the bulletin board
slams down onto...

A GLOBE

knocking it out of its stand.  The globe starts rolling
right at Buzz.

Woody stands frozen in disbelief at the chaos he's created.

Buzz runs along the desk, the globe rolling right behind
him, Indiana Jones style.  Buzz gets stuck "log rolling" on
a pile of pencils, but at the last second jumps out of the
way onto the window ledge.

The globe lumbers past Buzz and strikes a Luxo-style
desklamp.  The arm of the lamp swings all the way around,
barely missing Woody...

...and knocks Buzz out the window.

                         TOYS
            BUZZ!!!!

                         WOODY
            Buzz!!!

Woody looks out the window.  No sign of Buzz.  All the other
toys rush over to the sill.

                         SLINKY
            I don't see him in the driveway!  I
            think he bounced into Sid's yard.

Woody backs away from the COMMOTION, unnoticed.

                         REX
                   (GASP)
            Buzz!

                         RC CAR
                   (electric motor sounds)
            Whirrr!!  Whirrrr-whirrrr!!!

Rex looks over at RC.  The remote control car is bouncing up
and down excitedly.

                         REX
            Hey everyone!  RC's trying to say
            something!

The toys turn from the window to RC.

                         REX
                   (leaning down close
                   to RC)
            What is it, boy?

                         RC CAR
                   (electric motor sounds)
            Whirrr!!! Whirrr!  Whirrrrrr!!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            He's sayin' that this was no accident.

                         TOYS
            Huh?

                         BO PEEP
            What do you mean?

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            I mean Humpty Dumpty was pushed...
                   (pointing at Woody)
            ...by Woody.

                         TOYS
            WHAT?!?

The toys turn to Woody who suddenly realizes how this looks.

                         WOODY
            Wait a minute.  You -- you don't
            think I meant to knock Buzz out the
            window, do you Potato Head?

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you
            back-stabbin' murderer!

                         WOODY
            Now, it was an accident!  Guys,
            c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me

                         SLINKY
            We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?

                         REX
                   (backing away)
            Oh, I don't like confrontations.

The Sargent pops out of the army bucket next to Woody.

                         SARGENT
            Where is your honor, dirtbag?!  You
            are an absolute disgrace!  You
            don't deserve to --

Woody seals the lid back on the bucket.

Potato Head starts closing in on Woody.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Couldn't handle Buzz cuttin' in on
            your playtime, could ya Woody?
            Didn't want to face the fact that
            Buzz just might be Andy's new
            favorite toy, so you got rid of him.
            Well, what if Andy starts playin'
            with me more, Woody, huh?  You
            gonna knock me outta the window, too?

Potato Head has driven Woody back to the very edge of the
desk -- trapped.

                         HAMM
            I don't think we should give him
            the chance.

Suddenly, the lid pops off the bucket of army men.

                         SARGENT
            There he is, men!  Frag him!

The army men yell CHARGE and pounce on Woody, while all the
rest of the toys close in.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Let's string him up by his pull-
            string!

                         HAMM
            I got dibs on his hat!

                         BO PEEP
            Would you boys stop it?!

                         HAMM
            Tackle him!

                         WOODY
            No, no, no, no!  Wait!  Wait I can
            explain everything --

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Andy, c'mon!

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Okay, Mom, be right down.  I've got
            to get Buzz.

                         SARGENT
            Retreat!

The toys all drop Woody and rush back to their places.

Andy enters the room and heads straight for the desk where
Woody is lying.  Andy overlooks Woody and begins searching
around the room.

                         ANDY
            Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            No, I haven't seen him.

Woody painfully watches as Andy searches in vain for Buzz.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD (O.S.)
            Psssst!

Woody looks across the room.

Potato Head and Etch-A-Sketch peek out of a packing box.
Etch-A-Sketch scribbles a hangman's noose while Potato Head
points an accusing finger in Woody's direction.

Woody GULPS.

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Andy!  I'm heading out the door.

                         ANDY
            But Mom, I can't find him!

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Well, honey, just grab some other
            toy!  Now c'mon!

                         ANDY
            Okay...

He grabs Woody and walks out of the room.

EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Andy exits the house dragging Woody as he heads toward the
family van in the driveway.

                         ANDY
            I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I
            left him right there.

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Honey, I'm sure he's around.
            You'll find him.

A BUSH

next to the van begins to rustle.  Hands part the foliage,
revealing Buzz.  He eyes Woody going into the van and does a
slow burn.

The van ENGINE STARTS UP.  Buzz races out of the bush, and
with a mighty leap, grabs the rear fender of the van as it
pulls out of the driveway.

ANGLE: SIDE OF ANDY'S HOUSE

A chain of monkeys falls into view, dangling a considerable
distance above the ground.

EXT. ANDY'S BEDROOM WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

The rest of Andy's toys have regrouped at the window,
supervising the lowering of the "monkey chain."

                         SLINKY
            It's too short!  We need more monkeys!

                         REX
                   (holding up an empty barrel)
            There aren't any more!  That's the
            whole barrel.

Rex throws the barrel down and runs back to the ledge.

                         REX
                   (yelling out window)
            Buzz!  The monkeys aren't working!
            We're formulating another plan!
            Stay calm!
                   (beat)
            Oh, where could he be?

EXT. GAS STATION - LATER

The Davis' family van pulls up to one of the pumps.

INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS

Andy sits in the rear seat with Woody lying next to him.

                         ANDY
            Can I help pump the gas?

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Sure!  I'll even let you drive.

Both Mrs. Davis and Andy exit the van while baby Molly
sleeps up front in her car seat.

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Yeah?!

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Yeah -- when you're sixteen.

                         ANDY (O.S.)
                   (sarcastic)
            Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom.

With Mom and Andy out of range, Woody comes to life.  He
stares out the sun roof, still reeling from everything.

                         WOODY
            Oh, great.  How am I gonna convince
            those guys it was an accident?

Suddenly, Buzz appears over the edge of the sun roof.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!

Buzz jumps down on the back seat to face Woody.  He is furious.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!  You're alive!  This is great!
            Oh, I'm saved!  I'm saved!  Andy'll
            find you here, he'll take us back
            to the room, and then you can tell
            everyone that this was all just a
            big mistake.  Huh?

No response from Buzz.  Just an angry stare.

                         WOODY
                   (weakly)
            Right?  Buddy?

                         BUZZ
            I just want you to know that even
            though you tried to terminate me,
            revenge is not an idea we promote
            on my planet.

                         WOODY
            Oh.  Oh, that's good.

                         BUZZ
                   (getting in Woody's face)
            But we're not on my planet, are we?

                         WOODY
            No.

Buzz lunges for Woody.  The two toys fly off the seat and
out the open side door of the van.

EXT. GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS

Woody and Buzz hit the ground and roll under the van, locked
in mortal combat.

                         WOODY
            Ok!  Come on!  You want a piece of
            me?!

Buzz lands a punch that sends Woody's head spinning around.

Woody lunges with all his might.  He smacks Buzz in the
face, making it SQUEAK with every blow.

Buzz closes his helmet on Woody's hand.

                         WOODY
            Owwwww!!!

Woody pounds on Buzz's chest with his free hand, activating
BUZZ'S SAMPLED VOICE buttons.

SFX: CAR DOOR SLAM

The toys stop fighting.  Before they can react...

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Next stop...

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!

The van drives off.

                         WOODY
                   (GASP)
            Andy?!

Woody starts to run in the direction of the van but it
drives out of sight, leaving Buzz and Woody stranded.

                         WOODY
            Doesn't he realize that I'm not
            there?
                   (beat)
            I'm LOST!  Oh, I'm a lost toy!

Meanwhile, Buzz checks the surroundings.  He flips open his
wrist communicator.

                         BUZZ
            Buzz Lightyear Mission Log.  The
            local Sheriff and I seem to be at a
            huge refueling station of some
            sort --

Woody whips around, his expression changing from panic to
seething anger.  He charges at Buzz.

                         WOODY
            You!

SFX: LOUD TRUCK HORN

Just then the toys are bathed in the headlight beams of a
behemoth tanker truck pulling into the station.

Buzz dives off to the side while Woody collapses right where
he stands on the pavement.  The truck ROARS over him.

A GIGANTIC TIRE

stops just millimeters from Woody's nose.

Petrified, Woody inches away from the tire, moving back
under the truck until he bumps into Buzz.

                         BUZZ
                   (into wrist communicator)
            According to my nava-computer, the --

                         WOODY
                   (whispering)
            Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!

                         BUZZ
            Sheriff, this is no time to panic.

                         WOODY
            This is the perfect time to panic!
            I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're
            going to move from their house in
            two days and it's all your fault!!

                         BUZZ
            My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me
            out of the window in the first
            place --

                         WOODY
            Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't
            shown up in your stupid little
            cardboard spaceship and taken away
            everything that was important to
            me --

                         BUZZ
            Don't talk to me about importance.
            Because of YOU the security of this
            entire universe is in jeopardy.

                         WOODY
                   (incredulous)
            WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!

Buzz walk to the edge of the truck tire and points up to the
stars.

                         BUZZ
            Right now, poised at the edge of
            the galaxy, Emperor Zurg has been
            secretly building a weapon with the
            destructive capacity to annihilate
            an entire planet.  I alone have
            information that reveals this
            weapon's only weakness.
                   (pointing at Woody)
            And you, my friend, are responsible
            for delaying my rendez-vous with
            Star Command.

Woody explodes.

                         WOODY
            YOU ARE A TOY!!!  You aren't the
            real Buzz Lightyear, you're an
            action figure!!  You are a child's
            plaything!!!

Beat.

                         BUZZ
            You are a sad strange little man
            and you have my pity.  Farewell.

Buzz walks off.

                         WOODY
            Oh, yeah?  Well, good riddance, ya
            looney!

Woody walks away in the opposite direction.

                         WOODY
                   (to himself)
            Rendez-vous with Star Command.

SFX: SCREECHING TIRES FOLLOWED BY GAS STATION BELL

                         PIZZA DELIVERER (O.S.)
            Hey, Gas Dude!

                         ATTENDANT (O.S.)
            You talkin' to me?

                         PIZZA DELIVERER (O.S.)
            Yeah, man, can you help me?  Do you
            know where Cutting Blvd. is?

                         ATTENDANT (O.S.)
            Just a moment...

Woody looks in the direction of the bell.  His face lights
up at the sight of...

A PIZZA PLANET DELIVERY TRUCK.

                         WOODY
                   (to himself)
            Pizza Planet...Andy!

Woody takes a step forward and then stops.

                         WOODY
            Oh, no!  I can't show my face in
            that room without Buzz.

Woody runs back under the tanker truck.  Buzz is at the far
end of the truck, walking away from Woody.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!  Buzz, come back!

                         BUZZ
                   (continuing to walk away)
            Go away.

Woody looks back at the delivery truck in desperation and
then eyes...

ANGLE: DELIVERY TRUCK ROOF SIGN

Atop the truck is a rocket with the Pizza Planet logo.

                         WOODY
            No, Buzz, you've gotta come back.
            I found a spaceship!

Buzz stops walking away and looks back at Woody.

                         WOODY
            It's a spaceship, Buzz!

EXT. GAS STATION - A FEW MINUTES LATER

The delivery truck's engine has stalled and is off.

                         PIZZA DELIVERER (O.S.)
            C'mon, man, hurry up.  Um, like the
            pizza's are getting cold here.

Woody and Buzz eye the parked delivery truck from within the
safety of a nearby oilcan display.

                         BUZZ
            Now you're sure this spacefreighter
            will return to its port of origin
            once it jettisons its food supply?

                         WOODY
            Uh-huh.  And when we get there,
            we'll be able to find a way to
            transport you...home.

                         BUZZ
            Well, then let's climb abroad.

Buzz makes a beeline for the passenger side door of the
pizza truck.  Woody chases after him.

                         WOODY
            No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's
            get in the back.  No one will see
            us there.

                         BUZZ
            Negative.  There are no restraining
            harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll
            be much safer in the cockpit.

In a flash, Buzz has scaled the front tire, grabbed the rear
view mirror, and swung himself up and into the cab.

                         WOODY
                   (loud whisper)
            Yeah, but, Buzz!  Buzz!

                         PIZZA DELIVERER (O.S.)
            Ok, so that's two lefts, and then a
            right, huh?

                         ATTENDANT (O.S.)
            Yeah.

                         PIZZA DELIVERER (O.S.)
            Okay, thanks for the directions.

                         WOODY
                   (loud whisper)
            Buzz!

SFX: ENGINE STARTING

Woody runs around to the back of the truck, scrambles up the
bumper and throws open the back hatch to climb inside.

Woody lets out a YELL, as the back hatch slams back down on
his rear, sending him flying into the bed of the truck.

INT. PIZZA PLANET DELIVERY TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Woody peeks through the dividing window into the cab.

Buzz is hidden from THE PIZZA DRIVER's view by a stack of
pizzas in their insulated covers.  Buzz prudently fastens
his safety belt.

                         WOODY
            It'll be safer in the cockpit than
            the cargo bay.  What an idiot!

The driver shifts into gear and hits the gas, propelling
Woody to the back of the truck.

The pizza deliverer drives like a maniac, taking sharp turns
and hills at high speeds.  Woody is helplessly thrown around
the truck.  With every blow, Woody YELPS in pain.

The truck climbs a steep hill.  Woody looks up just in time
to see...

A LARGE TOOL BOX

barreling towards him.

BAM!!!

                                            CUT TO:

A STAR-FILLED BLACK NIGHT SKY

We MOVE DOWN to reveal...

EXT. PIZZA PLANET - NIGHT

The delivery truck barrels into the parking lot and parks.

INT. DELIVERY TRUCK - CAB - CONTINUOUS

After the driver leaves the truck, Buzz peeks out from the
passenger window.

ANGLE: THE FRONT ENTRANCE

Two imposing animatronic robots guard the doorway.  As
CUSTOMERS approach the front, the guards part their crossed
"pizza spears," allowing the patrons to enter.

                         ROBOT GUARDS
            You are clear to enter.  Welcome to
            Pizza Planet.

VARIOUS ANNOUNCEMENTS blare out from speakers:

                         MALE VOICE OVER SPEAKER
            Next shuttle lift-off scheduled for
            T-minus 30 minutes and counting...

                         FEMALE VOICE OVER SPEAKER
            The white zone is for eating pizza
            only.  The white zone is for...

Excited, Buzz pries open the window between the cab and
truck bed.

                         BUZZ
            Sheriff!

Woody is gone.  Just the toolbox and strewn trash.

                         BUZZ
                   (continued)
            Sheriff?

The toolbox falls on its side revealing Woody.  He peels off
the back of the truck and falls into a pile of trash.

                         BUZZ
            There you are.  Now the entrance is
            heavily guarded.  We need a way to
            get inside.

Woody rises from the trash with a "MEGA-GULP" cup on his head.

                         BUZZ
            Great idea, Woody!  I like your
            thinking!

EXT. PIZZA PLANET - FRONT ENTRANCE

In the f.g. sits a trashcan with fast food containers
littered around it.  MORE CUSTOMERS approach the "guarded"
entrance.

                         ROBOT GUARDS
            You are clear to enter.  Welcome to
            Pizza Planet.

The front doors automatically swing open as the people pass
through.  Suddenly two pieces of trash -- a burger container
and "MEGA-GULP" cup stand up.

                         BUZZ
                   (in burger container)
            NOW!

The two disguised toys make a dash through the closing doors.

                         BUZZ
                   (in container)
            Quickly, Sheriff!  The airlock is
            closing.

INT. PIZZA PLANET - FRONT ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Woody and Buzz just make it inside but then freeze
immediately as a GROUP OF KIDS run past, forcing the toys to
pose as discarded trash.

Once the coast is clear, Woody and Buzz resume walking.
Buzz bumps into Woody.

                         WOODY
                   (using straw as periscope)
            Ow!  Watch where you're going!

                         BUZZ
                   (mouthing with burger box)
            Sorry.

They sneak in between two long rows of video games and throw
off their disguises.  They then take a good look at...

THE ARCADE

The space-themed arena is filled with hordes of children
playing video games.  A sea of HI-TECH SOUNDS and lights
overwhelm the place.

Buzz is beaming with hope.

                         BUZZ
            What a space port.  Good work, Woody.

Woody is busy looking at all the children in the arcade, but
none of the kids look familiar to him.  Just then he HEARS...

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Mom, can I play Black Hole?
            Please, please, please?!

Woody turns around and through the video games he spots...

ANDY

standing with Mom and Molly in her stroller.

                         WOODY
                   (to himself)
            Andy!

                         MRS. DAVIS
            What's Black Hole?

                         ANDY
            Oh, it's so cool...

The family begins to walk away.

                         BUZZ
            Now we need to find a ship that's
            headed for Sector 12 --

Buzz is about to head off in the opposite direction when
Woody grabs him and quickly pulls him down the video corridor.

                         WOODY
            Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way!
            There's a special ship.  I just saw
            it!

                         BUZZ
            You mean it has hyperdrive?

                         WOODY
            Hyper-active hyperdrive, and
            astro...uh, turf.

The toys manage to get ahead of Andy.  Woody peeks around
the corner of one of the video games and waits for Mom and
Andy to approach.

                         WOODY
                   (tracking Andy and family)
            C'mon, c'mon, that's it...

                         BUZZ
            Where is it?  I don't see the --

Buzz stops short at the sight of...

A CRANE GAME

It is modeled to look like a spaceship ready to launch.

                         BUZZ
                   (continued)
            Spaceship.

                         WOODY
            Alright Buzz, get ready...

Buzz heads for the crane game, but Woody does not notice,
his eyes locked on the approaching stroller.

                         WOODY
            Okay, Buzz, when I say "go," we're
            gonna jump in the basket --

Woody turns and realizes Buzz is gone.  He looks across the
way just in time to see Buzz leap into the crane game
through the "PRIZE" slot.

                         WOODY
                   (loud whisper)
            Buzz!

Woody turns back in the direction of the stroller.

It has already gone past.

                         WOODY
            Dooh!  No!  This cannot be
            happening to me!!

Woody runs towards the crane game, but is forced to hold
back for a moment as some SCREAMING children pass by.

INT. CRANE GAME

Buzz climbs over the partition that divides the deposit slot
from the prize toys and leaps into a pile of...

SQUEEZE TOY ALIENS

There are hundreds of them, all identical and way too cute.

                         ALIEN #1
                   (excited)
            A stranger!

                         ALIEN #2
            From the outside!

                         ALIENS
            Oo-o-o-o-o-o...

                         BUZZ
            Greetings!  I am Buzz Lightyear!  I
            come in peace!

                         ALIENS
            Tell us!  What is it like outside?

The squeeze toys rush Buzz like JABBERING excited children.

EXT. CRANE GAME

With the kids gone, Woody crosses the aisle to the crane
game and dives through the prize slot.

INT. CRANE GAME - CONTINUOUS

Woody clambers up the side of the deposit slot.

                         BUZZ (O.S.)
            This is an intergalactic emergency!
            I need to commandeer your vessel to
            Sector 12!

Woody peeks over the partition to witness Buzz surround by
the cute alien toys.

                         BUZZ
                   (continued; to the aliens)
            Who's in charge here?

All the aliens point upward.

                         ALIENS
            The cla-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-w!!

Woody and Buzz look up.

ANGLE: CRANE GAME CLAW

It dangles directly above the toys.

                         ALIEN #1
            The claw is our master.

                         ALIEN #2
            The claw chooses who will go and
            who will stay.

                         WOODY
                   (to himself)
            This is ludicrous.

                         SID (O.S.)
                   (laughter)

Woody GASPS at the recognition of Sid's voice.  He turns to
see Sid heading straight for the crane game.

                         WOODY
            Oh, no!  Sid!!!

Woody leaps off the partition and tackles Buzz, pushing the
two of them deep into the pile of aliens.

                         WOODY
            Get down!!

Sid approaches the crane game and fishes quarters out of his
pants pocket.

                         BUZZ
                   (loud whisper)
            What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I
            was --

                         WOODY
                   (loud whisper)
            YOU are the one that decided to
            climb into this --

                         ALIEN #4
                   (loud whisper)
            Sh-h-h-h-h-h.  The claw.  It moves.

ANGLE: CLAW

It moves into position and hovers directly above the area
where Woody and Buzz are hiding.

The crane drops and grabs hold of the alien toy that is
right on top of Buzz.

                         ALIEN #3
                   (whispering excitedly)
            I have been chosen!!

Positioned with his back to Sid, the alien is lifted up by
the claw.

                         ALIEN #3
                   (continued)
            Farewell, my friends!  I go on to a
            better place.

                         SID
            Gotcha!

With the alien gone, Buzz's upper torso becomes exposed,
forcing the space ranger to freeze.  Sid suddenly spots Buzz.

                         SID
            A Buzz Lightyear!  No way!

Woody, still hidden, frantically looks around for some way
to escape.  Behind him, through the aliens, he eyes...

A SMALL REPAIR DOOR

Woody swims through the alien squeeze toys toward the door.
He grabs hold of the locking latch and, after a few
attempts, is able to pry the door open.

The shadow of the crane lines up over Buzz, lowers, and
grabs his head.

                         SID
            Yes!

The claw begins to lift Buzz up.

                         WOODY
                   (GASP)
            Buzz, NO!

Woody grabs hold of Buzz's feet.

Woody and the claw begin to have a tug-of-war with Buzz.

Woody pulls down hard, forcing Buzz to sink into the pile of
aliens, out of Sid's view.

                         SID
                   (slamming his fist
                   against the glass)
            Wha -- ?  Hey!!

Still tugging against the crane, Woody is almost out the
door with Buzz.  Just then, the aliens at the bottom of the
pile pull Buzz and Woody back inside.

                         ALIEN #4
            He has been chosen.

                         WOODY
            Hey!  What are you doing?

                         ALIEN #5
            He must go.

                         WOODY
            Stop it, you -- !  Stop it, you
            zealots!

                         ALIENS
            He must go!  Do not fight the claw!
            Do not anger the claw!  He has been
            chosen.

Woody and Buzz are pushed up to the surface and into the
air, dangling lifelessly in front of Sid.

                         SID
            Alright!  Double prizes!

Woody and Buzz are dropped into the prize door slot and
snatched up by Sid.

                         SID
                   (looking at his two
                   new toys)
            Let's go home and...play.  Ha-ha-ha.

EXT. SID'S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

From out of the darkness appears Sid on his skateboard.  He
is HUMMING to rock music from his walkman while carrying his
backpack in his hand.

Sid leaps off the skateboard and walks up the front path
towards the front door.

Through the open zipper, Buzz peeks out of the backpack to
see Sid's house.  He recognizes Andy's house next door.

INT. BACKPACK - CONTINUOUS

Buzz, Woody and a squeeze toy alien are scrunched up in the
backpack.

                         BUZZ
            Sheriff!  I can see your dwelling
            from here!  You're almost home.

                         ALIEN
            Nirvana is coming!  The mystic
            portal awaits!

                         WOODY
                   (to Alien)
            Will you be quiet?!!
                   (to both)
            You guys don't get it, do you?
            Once we go into Sid's house, we
            won't be coming out.

ANGLE: TOYS' POV FROM OUT BACKPACK

The front door opens to reveal Scud.  The dog lunges
straight for the backpack, BARKING.

                         SID
            Whoa, Scud!  Hey, boy.  Sit!  Good
            boy!

The dog begrudgingly obeys.

                         SID
            Hey, I got somethin' for ya, boy.

Sid's hand reaches into the backpack.

                         WOODY
                   (loud whisper)
            FREEZE!!!

The toys go still.  Sid's hand grabs the alien out of the
backpack.  The alien is then placed sideways along Scud's
snout.

                         SID
            Ready, set, NOW.

In one quick motion, Scud flips the alien up, catches it in
his mouth, and rabidly shakes it back and forth.

Buzz and Woody react in horror.

                         SID
            Hannah!  Hey, Hannah!!!

Woody and Buzz glance up to see HANNAH, Sid's frail little
sister, carrying her Janie Doll.

                         HANNAH
            What?

                         SID
            Did I get my package in the mail?

                         HANNAH
            I dunno.

                         SID
            Whaddaya mean, you don't know?

                         HANNAH
                   (insistent)
            I don't know!

                         SID
                   (mock concern)
            Oh no, Hannah!

                         HANNAH
            What?

                         SID
            Look!  Janie!

He grabs the doll.

                         HANNAH
            Hey!!

                         SID
            She's sick!

                         HANNAH
                   (panic rising)
            No she's NOT --

                         SID
            I'll have to perform one of
            my...operations!

                         HANNAH
            NO-O-O... Don't touch her!  NO!

Sid bolts upstairs with Hannah in pursuit.

                         WOODY
            Not Sid's room...not there...

INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - CONTINUOUS

Sid races to his bedroom door.  Hannah is right behind.

                         HANNAH
            Sid!  Give her back!

Sid just LAUGHS.  He charges into the room and slams the
door in his sister's face.

INT. SID'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                         HANNAH (O.S.)
                   (pounding on his door)
            Sid!  Sid!...

Sid carelessly tosses the backpack on the bed and walks over
to a makeshift workbench.

                         SID
                   (as Doctor)
            Oh, no.  We have a sick patient
            here, nurse.  Prepare the O.R., STAT!

Sid CLICKS on a bare bulb dangling above his "operating
table."

Woody and Buzz look on from the safety of the backpack as
Sid places the Janie doll's head in a vise.

                         HANNAH (O.S.)
            Sid, give her back!  Give her back
            now!  I'm telling!

                         SID
                   (as Doctor)
            Patient is...
                   (straining while
                   tightening vise)
            ...pre-e-epped.

Sid grabs a painter's mask from his toolchest and dons it
like a surgeon's mask.

                         SID
                   (as Doctor)
            No one's ever attempted a double
            bypass brain transplant before.

Sid grabs a toy pterodactyl from a nearby crate full of junk.

                         SID
                   (as Doctor)
            Now for the tricky part -- pliers!

                         BUZZ
                   (whispering to Woody)
            I don't believe that man's ever
            been to medical school.

Sid struggles for a moment with his "patient" then stops.

                         SID
                   (as Nurse)
            Doctor, you've done it!
                   (running to the door)
            Hannah?

He opens the door.  Hannah is standing there, looking worried.

                         SID
                   (continued)
            Janie's all better now.

He hands her Janie -- her head has been replaced with a
pterodactyl's.  Hannah SCREAMS at the sight of the
monstrosity and bolts down the hallway.

                         HANNAH
            MOM!!  MOM!!

                         SID
            She's lying!  Whatever she says
            it's not true!

Sid throws the doll to the ground and runs after Hannah,
slamming the door behind him.

Woody and Buzz peer out of the backpack at their new
surroundings.  Heavy metal posters, discarded toy remains
and power tools adorn the messy room.

They are in Hell...toy Hell.

                         WOODY
            We are gonna die.
                   (bolting out of the pack)
            I'm outta here!

Woody leaps from the bed to the doorknob and struggles to
open it.  No good.  Woody drops to the floor.

                         WOODY
            Locked!  There's gotta be another
            way out of here.

SFX: ROLLING SOUND

Woody is startled by the noise.

A small yo-yo rolls out from behind a box and falls on its
side.

Spooked, Woody grabs a pencil from the floor and brandishes
it like a weapon.

Just then a shadow passes by Woody.  He turns quickly but
sees nothing.

                         WOODY
            Uh...Buzz?  Was that you?

Woody hurriedly trades his pencil for a larger flashlight.

He hears a NOISE from under Sid's bed.  Woody turns on the
flashlight and shines the beam in the direction of the
noise, illuminating...

A BABY DOLL HEAD'S PROFILE

                         WOODY
            Hey!  Hi, there, little fellah!
            Come out here.  Do you know a way
            out of here?

The baby doll moves out from under the bed, revealing a one-
eyed doll head atop a spider-like body made of erector set
pieces.

                         WOODY
                   (GASP!!)

The creature extends its legs and rises up taller than Woody.
Scared speechless, Woody keeps his flashlight beam locked on
BABYFACE.

Various other MUTANT TOYS begin to emerge from the shadows:
a toy fishing pole with fashion doll legs, a skateboard with
a combat soldier's torso screwed to the front end, a jack-
in-the-box with a rubber hand for a head, (and others).

Woody leaps onto the bed and hides behind Buzz.

                         WOODY
            B-B-B-Buzz!

Buzz and Woody look on as the mutants have a tug of war as
they grab all the Janie and pterodactyl parts, dragging them
off into the shadows.

                         BUZZ
            They're cannibals!

Woody retreats back into the backpack.

INT. BACKPACK - CONTINUOUS

Woody cowers in the corner as Buzz enters.  He punches a
button on his chest.

                         BUZZ
            May day!  May day!  Come in, Star
            Command!  Send reinforcements!...
                   (pause)
            Star Command, do you copy?

No response.

Buzz adjusts his laser light.  It emits a short BLIP.

                         BUZZ
                   (aiming his arm out
                   the pack)
            I've set my laser from stun to kill.

                         WOODY
            Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if
            anyone attacks us we can blink 'em
            to death.

EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Rex points a flashlight out of Andy's bedroom window while
Bo Peep, Slinky, Hamm and Potato Head look on.

Some bushes rustle below.

                         REX
            Hey, you guys!  I think I've found
            him.  Buzz!  Is that you?!

Rex points the flashlight beam at the shaking bushes.  The
annoyed MEOW of a cat is heard.

                         REX
            Whiskers!  Will you get out of
            here?!  You're interfering with the
            search and rescue.

SFX: APPROACHING CAR

Rex turns off the flashlight.

                         REX
                   (whispering)
            Look!  They're home!

The toys duck behind the sill.

The Davis' family van pulls into the driveway.  Andy and Mrs.
Davis get out.

                         ANDY
            Mom, have you seen Woody?

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Where was the last place you left him?

                         ANDY
                   (searching the van)
            Right here in the van.

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're
            just not looking hard enough.

                         ANDY
            He's not here, Mom.  Woody's gone.

The toys all look at one another.

                         BO PEEP
                   (GASP)
            Woody's gone?!

                         HAMM
            Well waddah-ya-know, the weasel ran
            away.

Hamm, Potato Head and Rex walk away from the window.
                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was
            guilty.

                         REX
            Who would've thought he was capable
            of such atrocities?!

Bo Peep and Slinky are left alone at the window, visibly
crestfallen.

                         BO PEEP
            Oh, Slink, I hope he's okay.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. SID'S BEDROOM WINDOW - DAY

                         SID (O.S.)
                   (as Interrogator)
            Oh, a survivor.  Where is the rebel
            base?  Talk!

SFX: HAND SLAP

INT. SID'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

An inanimate Woody flies across the room, landing hard on
the floor.

Sid crosses to the window.

                         SID
                   (as Interrogator)
            I can see your will is strong.

Sid opens the window shade.  Bright sunlight shines down
onto Woody.

                         SID
                   (continued)
            Well, we have ways of making you talk.

Sid pulls out a magnifying glass from his back pocket and
focuses the beam on Woody's forehead.

                         SID
                   (as Interrogator)
            Where are your rebel friends now?
            Heh, heh.

A bright white hot dot forms on Woody's forehead and begins
to smolder.

                         SID'S MOM (O.S.)
            Sid!!  Your pop-tarts are ready!

Sid pulls the magnifying glass away.

                         SID
            Alright!!

Sid runs out of the room.  As soon as he's gone, Woody jumps
up SCREAMING, his forehead burning.

He runs to a bowl of half-eaten cereal (with milk) on the
floor, and dunks his head in.

Buzz runs over to Woody, pausing to remove two suction cup
darts from his person before pulling Woody out of the bowl.
Two colorful Froot-Loops stick to each of Woody's eyes like
glasses.

                         BUZZ
            Are you alright?
                   (whacking him on the back)
            I'm proud of you, Sheriff.  A
            lesser man would have talked under
            such torture.

Woody looks at his reflection in the back of the cereal
spoon and rubs the burn mark on his forehead.

                         WOODY
            I sure hope this isn't permanent.

                         BUZZ
                   (checking his wrist communicator)
            Still no word from Star Command.
            We're not that far from the
            spaceport --

Woody's eyes light up.

ANGLE: SPOON

Sid's bedroom door can be seen in the reflection.  It's open.

                         WOODY
            The door!  It's open!  We're free!!

Woody runs for the door.  Buzz follows.

                         BUZZ
            Woody, we don't know what's out there!

                         WOODY
            I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!

THE MUTANT TOYS

suddenly appear and block their path to the doorway.  Woody
hides behind Buzz.

                         WOODY
            They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!  Do
            something!  Quick!

                         BUZZ
            Shield your eyes!

Buzz fires his laser at them.  The little red beam just
flickers against Babyface's head.  The mutant toys look
confusedly at each other.

                         BUZZ
            It's not working.  I recharged it
            before I left.  It should be good
            for hours --

                         WOODY
            Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use
            your karate chop action!

Grabbing Buzz like a hostage, Woody fends off the mutant
toys by pushing a large button on Buzz's back, making Buzz's
arm involuntarily "chop" up and down.

                         WOODY
                   (to mutants)
            Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!

                         BUZZ
            Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that?
            Stop that!

                         WOODY
            Back!  Back, you savages!  Back!

Woody circles around the mutant toys to the open doorway,
continually chopping Buzz's arm.

                         BUZZ
            Woody, stop it!!

                         WOODY
            Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!

Woody drops Buzz and runs out the door.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Woody races down the corridor...

                         WOODY
                   (to himself)
            There's no place like home.
            There's no place like home.
            There's no place like home...

...turns onto the top of the stairwell, down a few steps,
and is confronted by...

SCUD

asleep on the landing.

Woody freezes inches away from the sleeping beast.  He
slowly backs up the stairs.

Suddenly Buzz appears and pulls Woody back against the
hallway wall.  He covers Woody's mouth with his hand.

                         WOODY
                   (muffled gasp)


                         BUZZ
                   (whisper)
            Another stunt like that, cowboy --
            you're going to get us killed.

                         WOODY
                   (pulling Buzz's hand away)
            Don't tell me what to do!

                         BUZZ
            Shhh!

Buzz checks to make sure Scud is still asleep and then darts
across the stairwell opening to the other end of the hallway.
Once safely across, he motions for Woody to follow.

Woody cowardly crawls on all fours across the open area and
meets up with Buzz.

As he stands...

WOODY'S PULLSTRING RING

gets caught on one of the curls of the wrought iron railing.

The toys begin to creep down the hallway, unaware that
Woody's pullstring is being pulled farther and farther
until --

It SNAPS off the iron railing and flies back towards Woody.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            YEEEEEEE-HAAAAAAA!!

Both Buzz and Woody leap in surprise at the sound of Woody's
voice box.

ANGLE: SCUD'S EYE

It opens.

Woody vainly attempts to stifle the recoiling pullstring.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
                   (continued)
            Giddy-up partner!...

GROWLING, Scud starts up the stairs.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
                   (continued)
            ...We got to get this wagon train a
            movin'!

Woody and Buzz take off running.

                         BUZZ
            Split up!

Two doors are ajar at the other end of the hallway.  Buzz
dives behind one while Woody jumps into...

A CLOSET

Woody slams the door shut just as Scud reaches the top of
the landing.  CRASHED can be heard from behind the closet
door, getting Scud's attention.

Buzz peeks out from his doorway at Scud SNIFFING AND
GROWLING at the closet.

Sensing movement behind him, Scud whips around and starts to
enter Buzz's doorway.

SFX: SNORING

The noise stops the dog in his tracks.  Both Scud and Buzz
look up to see...

INT. SID'S DAD'S DEN - CONTINUOUS

MR. PHILLIPS is asleep on a La-Z-Boy recliner in front of
the T.V.

Scud backs out and heads down the stairs.

Buzz turns to exit the room when he hears...

                         SPACE COMMANDER (O.S.; ON TV)
            Calling Buzz Lightyear!!  Come in
            Buzz Lightyear!!  This is Star
            Command.  Buzz Lightyear!  Do you
            read me?!

                         BUZZ
            Star Command!

Buzz opens up his wrist communicator and is just about to
speak into it when he is interrupted.

                         KID #1 (O.S.)
            Buzz Lightyear responding!  Read
            you loud and clear!

Buzz turns around to see...

A TELEVISION SET

Buzz's space ranger logo is on the screen over a field of
stars.  The image quickly changes to two young boys playing
in their backyard with a Buzz Lightyear doll.

                         SPACE COMMANDER
            Buzz Lightyear, Planet Earth needs
            your help!

                         KID #1
                   (into toy wrist communicator)
            On the way!

                         MALE CHORUS (V.O.)
            BUZZ LIGHTYEAR!!!

Buzz reacts with confusion at what he is watching.  He walks
slowly towards the television set.

                         TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
            The world's greatest superhero!
            Now the world's greatest TOY!

ANGLE: TV COMMERCIAL

The Buzz Lightyear doll is now out of the box and being
displayed.

                         TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
            Buzz has it all!  Locking wrist
            communicator!

                         KID #2
            Wow!

With every feature demonstrated on the TV, Buzz compares the
same feature on himself.

                         TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
            Pulsating laserlight!

                         KID #2

            It's a secret mission in uncharted
            space!

Buzz presses the same button on his uniform.

                         BUZZ (SAMPLED VOICE)
            It's a secret mission in uncharted
            space!

                         TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
            And best of all...

            HIGH-PRESSURE-SPACE-WINGS!!

                         TV BUZZ
            To Infinity and Beyond!

On the TV screen, the Buzz Lightyear action figure appears
to be launched through the air.  The words:  NOT A FLYING
TOY flash across the bottom of the screen.

                         TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                   (non-excited lawyer voice)
            Not a flying toy.

Buzz slowly shakes his head in wide-eyed disbelief.

                         TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
            Get your Buzz Lightyear action
            figure and save a galaxy near you!

                         MALE CHORUS (V.O.)
            BUZZ LIGHTYEAR!!!

The image on the screen changes to a shot of hundreds of
Buzzes in their boxes lining either side of a store aisle.

                         LOCAL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
            Available at all Al's Toy Barn
            outlets in the tri-county area.

Buzz is stricken.  He looks down at his wrist communicator
and opens it.

ANGLE: WRIST COMMUNICATOR

Molded on the underside of the cover are three words: "MADE
IN TAIWAN."

SONG: "I WILL GO SAILING NO MORE" BEGINS

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Buzz walks dejectedly out of the den and down the hallway.

As he passes the top of the stairwell he pauses to look up
through the railing at...

A SMALL WINDOW

It is open, revealing the blue sky beyond.  A bird flies past.

The taunting voice of Woody echoes in his head.

                         WOODY (V.O.)
            You are a toy!  You can't fly!

Buzz bows his head, defeated.

BEAT

Slowly Buzz raises his head, determination in his eyes.  He
slams the offending wrist communicator shut, as if to deny
its message of "Made in Taiwan."

Buzz climbs up the railing to the banister.  He pops open
his wings, and aims himself towards the window above.

                         BUZZ
            To Infinity and Beyond!

Buzz leaps off the banister...

and falls.

In SLOW MOTION Buzz watches his square of blue sky pull
farther away from him as he plummets to the floor below.

INT. SID'S HOUSE/ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS

Buzz CRASHES on the entryway floor.

Buzz opens his eyes to see...

HIS SEVERED LEFT ARM

The broken arm lies a few inches away from his now empty arm
socket.

Buzz drops his head back in defeat.

SONG ENDS

                         HANNAH (O.S.)
            M-o-o-om?  Mom, have you seen my
            Sally doll?

Hannah walks into the entryway, and not seeing Buzz, steps
on him.

                         MOM (O.S.)
            What, dear?  What was that?

Hannah picks up Buzz (and his arm) and smiles.

                         HANNAH
            Nevermind.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - LATER

ANGLE: CLOSET

The knob jiggles for a moment.  Suddenly, the door flies
open revealing Woody, entangled in Christmas lights,
standing atop a pile of boxes to be at doorknob height.

Woody and the rest of the junk topple over.

A bowling ball topples out, smashing Woody square on the head.

                         WOODY
            Oo-o-of!
                   (to the hallway)
            Buzz?!  The coast is clear.  Buzz?
            Where are you?
                         BUZZ (O.S.; SAMPLED VOICE)
            It's a secret mission in uncharted
            space!  Let's go!!

Woody creeps down the hallway, dragging the Christmas lights
with him.

                         HANNAH (O.S.)
            Really?  That is so-o-o interesting.

Woody peeks into the open doorway of...

INT. HANNAH'S BEDROOM/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Hannah is pretending to have a tea party.  Her guests are
dolls, headless dolls, that is except for...

BUZZ

He is seated at the miniature table, dressed up in a frilly
apron and fashionable party hat.

                         HANNAH
                   (continued)
            Would you like some tea, Mrs. Nesbit?

                         WOODY
                   (under his breath)
            Buzz!

Hannah has placed a tiny teapot in Buzz's severed arm and
pours imaginary tea with it.

                         HANNAH
            It's so nice you could join us on
            such late notice.

Woody steps back into the hallway.

                         WOODY
            Oh, no!

                         HANNAH
            What a lovely hat, Mrs. Nesbit.  It
            goes quite well with your head.

Woody thinks for a moment, then takes a few steps further
down the hall.  He CLEARS HIS THROAT.

                         WOODY
                   (high voice)
            Hannah!  Oh, Hannah!

Hannah stops pouring tea and looks up.

                         HANNAH
                   (yelling out her room)
            Mom?
                   (to the dolls)
            Please excuse me, ladies.  I'll be
            right back.

As soon as Hannah exits the room Buzz keels over face-down
onto the table.

Hannah passes Woody, hidden in the Christmas lights, and
walks downstairs.

                         HANNAH
            What is it, Mom?  Mom, where are you?

Woody bolts into Hannah's room.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!  Hey, Buzz!  Are you okay?

Buzz lifts his head up and wails in drunken despair.

                         BUZZ
            Gone!  It's all go-o-one!  All of
            it's gone.  Bye-bye!  Whoo-hoo!
            See ya!

Woody picks up Buzz's severed arm.

                         WOODY
            What happened to you?

                         BUZZ
            One minute you're defending the
            whole galaxy...
                   (pointing at other dolls)
            ...and suddenly you find yourself
            suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie
            Antoinette and her little sisters.

The headless dolls turn and wave.

Woody removes the teapot from the severed arm and sets it on
the table.

                         WOODY
            I think you've had enough tea for
            today.
                   (helping Buzz up)
            Let's get you out of here, Buzz.

                         BUZZ
                   (grabbing Woody)
            Don't you get it?!  You see the hat?
            I am Mrs. Nesbit!!
                   (hysterical laughter)


                         WOODY
            Snap out of it, Buzz!

Woody presses Buzz's helmet open, slaps him across the face
with his own detached arm, and then politely closes the helmet.

Buzz sobers up and calmly takes his severed arm from Woody.
Buzz walks out of the room while Woody follows.

                         BUZZ
                   (sober)
            I'm sorry.  You're right.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

                         BUZZ
                   (continued)
            ...I'm just a little depressed,
            that's all.  I can get through this.

Buzz reaches the center of the hallway and drops to his knees.

                         BUZZ
            Oh, I'm a sham!!

                         WOODY
                   (loud whisper)
            Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.

                         BUZZ
            Look at me!  I can't even fly out
            of a window!

Woody stops short.  He looks down the hallway in the
direction of Sid's room.

ANGLE: SID'S BEDROOM WINDOW

Woody can see straight out Sid's window across the way to
Andy's bedroom window.

                         BUZZ
                   (continued)
            But -- the hat looked good.  Tell
            me the hat looked good!  The apron
            is a bit much, it's not my color...

                         WOODY
            Out the window...Buzz, you're a
            genius!

Woody grabs the coil of Christmas lights and drags Buzz
towards Sid's room.

                         WOODY
                   (continued)
            Come on, this way!

                         BUZZ
            Years of Academy training...wasted!!

EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE/ANDY'S BEDROOM WINDOW

Mr. Potato Head and Hamm are playing Battleship.  Hamm's
wearing Potato Head's hat.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            B-3.

                         HAMM
            Miss.  G-6.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Ohhh!  You sunk it!

                         HAMM
            Heh-heh.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Are you peeking?

                         HAMM
            Oh, quit your whining and pay up.

Potato Head reaches for his ear.

                         HAMM
            No, no, not the ear.  Gimme the
            nose.  C'mon!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
                   (pulling out his
                   nose; nasally)
            How 'bout three out of five?

He is about to hand his nose over to Hamm when...

                         WOODY (O.S.)
            Hey guys!  Guys!  Hey!

Both toys look across the way.

EXT. SID'S WINDOW/ANDY'S BEDROOM WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

Woody has just finished lifting Sid's window and waves to
the toys.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Son of a building block, it's Woody!

                         HAMM
            He's in the psycho's bedroom!

                         WOODY
            Hi!

                         HAMM
                   (into Andy's bedroom)
            Everyone, it's Woody!

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Slinky, Bo Peep and Rex look to the window.

                         BO PEEP
            Woody?!

                         REX
            You're kidding?

                         SLINKY
            Woody?!

INT. SID'S ROOM

                         WOODY
            We're gonna get outta here, Buzz --
            Buzz?

Buzz is not there.  Woody looks down at the floor.

Buzz is sitting on the floor, playing "bombs away" with his
broken arm.

EXT. ANDY'S BEDROOM WINDOW/SID'S WINDOW

The rest of Andy's toys gather around the window to see Woody.

                         REX
            Hey, look!

                         BO PEEP
            Woody!

                         WOODY
            Boy, am I glad to see you guys!

                         SLINKY
            I knew you'd come back, Woody!

                         BO PEEP
            What are you doing over there?

                         WOODY
            It's a long story, Bo.  I'll
            explain later.  Here, catch this!

Woody tosses one end of the Christmas lights over.  Slinky
catches them.

                         SLINKY
            I got it, Woody!

                         REX
                   (overly excited)
            He got it, Woody!

                         WOODY
            Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just
            tie it on to something!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea!
            How about we DON'T?!

Potato Head grabs the string of lights away from Slinky.

                         SLINKY
            Hey?!!

                         BO PEEP
            Potato Head!?

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Did you all take stupid pills this
            morning?!  Have you forgotten what
            he did to Buzz?  And now you want
            to let him back over here?

                         WOODY
            No, no, no!  You got it all wrong,
            Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz
            is right here.  He's with me!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            You are a liar!

                         WOODY
            No, I'm not!
                   (to Buzz)
            Buzz, come over here and you just
            tell the nice toys that you're not
            dead.

ANGLE: BUZZ

He doesn't respond, preoccupied with peeling off the sticker
on his wrist communicator.  He crumples it up and tosses it
aside.

                         WOODY
                   (to Andy's toys)
            Just a sec.

INT. SID'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Frantic, Woody walks over to the edge of the desk.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!  Will you get up here and
            give me a hand?!

Buzz's severed arm comes flying into view and lands by
Woody's feet.

                         WOODY
                   (insincerely)
            Ha ha.  That's very funny, Buzz.
                   (exploding)
            This is serious!!

                         REX (O.S.)
            Hey, Woody!?  Where'd ya go?

                         MR. POTATO HEAD (O.S.)
            He's lyin'.  Buzz ain't there.

EXT. SID'S WINDOW/ANDY'S WINDOW

Woody reappears at the edge of Sid's window.  He pretends to
notice something out of the other toy's view.

                         WOODY
                   (forced casualness)
            Oh, hi Buzz!  Why don't you say
            "hello" to the guys over there?

BUZZ'S SEVERED ARM

suddenly appears with Woody holding the end just out of
sight.  Woody throws his voice, pretending to be Buzz.

                         WOODY (AS BUZZ)
            Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and
            beyond!

                         REX
            Hey look!  It's Buzz!

                         WOODY
                   (shaking the arm's hand)
            Yeah, hey Buzz.  Let's show the
            guys our new secret best-friends
            hand shake.  Gimme five, man!

                         HAMM
            Something's screwy here.

                         WOODY
            So, you see?  We're friends now,
            guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?
                   (as BUZZ)
            You bet.  Gimme a hug.

Woody makes Buzz's arm grab his neck and pull him forward.

                         WOODY
                   (continued; as himself)
            Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.

                         SLINKY
            See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back
            the lights, Potato Head.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Wait just a minute.  What are you
            trying to pull?!

                         WOODY
            Nothing.

Woody innocently shrugs and throws both his hands up...

...exposing the severed arm.

The toys all SCREAM in horror.  Rex clasps his hands to his
mouth and turns away to BARF.

Realizing his mistake, Woody tries to hide the arm, but it's
too late.

                         HAMM
            Oh, that is disgusting.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Murderer!

                         WOODY
            No!  No, no, no, no!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            You murdering dog!

                         WOODY
            No, it's not what you think, I swear!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Save it for the jury.  I hope Sid
            pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!

Potato Head drops the lights.

                         WOODY
            No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave!
            You've gotta help us, please!  You
            don't know what it's like over here!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
                   (to the other toys)
            Come on.  Let's get out of here.

                         HAMM
            Go back to your lives, citizens.
            Show's over.

All the toys leave the window except Slinky.

                         WOODY
            Come back!  Slink!  Slink, please!
            Please!  Listen to me!

Unable to look Woody in the eye, Slinky closes the blinds.

                         WOODY
                   (continued)
            No!  No!  Come back!  SLI-I-I-INKYYY!!

SFX: THUNDER

As storm clouds roll over Sid's house, Woody slumps over the
window sill in defeat.

INT. SID'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

BROKEN TOY SOUNDS emit from behind Woody.  He turns from the
window to see...

THE MUTANT TOYS

converging all around Buzz.

                         WOODY
            BUZZ!!

Still holding onto Buzz's arm, Woody jumps down from the
desk and runs to Buzz's rescue.

                         WOODY
            Go away, you disgusting freaks!

Babyface turns from the fray and charges at Woody with his
erector-set pinchers.

Woody cowers, shielding himself from Buzz's arm.

Babyface clamps onto the arm and has a tug-o-war with Woody.

                         WOODY
            Alright back!  Back, you cannibals!

Woody loses his grip on the arm and sails across the room,
crashing into the wall.

By now there is no sight of Buzz within the swarming mass of
mutant toys.

Woody attacks the mob with a vengeance.

                         WOODY
            He is still alive, and you're not
            gonna get him, you monsters!

He furiously throws the mutant toys aside, digging his way
to...

BUZZ

He is sitting up, his broken arm now newly-attached.

Woody's anger turns to confusion.

                         WOODY
            Hey?!  Hey, they fixed you!

Woody shakes Buzz's arm to confirm what he's seeing is real
when he looks to the mutants.

                         WOODY
                   (continued)
            But -- but they're cannibals.  We
            saw them eat those other toys.

The mutant toys part to reveal the recent victims of Sid's
last "operation": The Janie Doll and Pterodactyl.  Their
heads have been taped back on the correct bodies.

The mutants all innocently stare at Woody.

                         WOODY
            Uh...sorry.  I...I thought that you
            were gonna...
                   (laughs nervously)
            ...you know, eat my friend.

Immediately, the mutant toys retreat back into the dark
corners of the room.

                         WOODY
            Hey!  No, no, wait!  Hey!  What's
            wrong?

                         SID'S MOM (O.S.)
            Sid!

                         SID (O.S.)
            Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!

                         WOODY
            Sid!!!

FOOTSTEPS approach the bedroom.  Woody tries to pick up the
still depressed Buzz, but he just goes limp.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!  C'mon, get up!  Buzz,
            you're...
                   (GRUNT)
            ...get up...

Woody begins dragging Buzz towards the bed, but their
progress is too slow.  He shakes Buzz hard.

                         WOODY
            Fine.  Let Sid trash you.  But
            don't blame me.

Woody leaves Buzz sitting alone in the middle of the floor
and hides underneath a nearby milkcrate just as...

Sid enters carrying a big box.

                         SID
            It came!  It finally came!

Sid runs over to his workbench and rips open the box.

                         SID
                   (reverently)
            The big one.

He pulls out a rocket with "THE BIG ONE" written on it.

                         SID
                   (reading the rocket label)
            "Extremely dangerous.  Keep out of
            reach of children."  COOL...
                   (looks around)
            What am I gonna blow?  Man...hey,
            where's that wimpy cowboy doll?

Sid spots the milkcrate and picks it up.

No Woody.

ANGLE: UNDERSIDE OF MILKCRATE

Out of Sid's view, Woody presses against the inside, hanging
on for dear life.

SFX: BUZZ'S LASER

Sid looks down and notices he's stepping on Buzz, activating
his laser.

                         SID
            Yes!  I've always wanted to put a
            spaceman into orbit.  Ha-ha.

He places Buzz and the milkcrate on the workbench and throws
a toolbox on top of the crate.

The impact of the toolbox dislodges Woody from his hiding
place.  Woody quickly ducks under a magazine on the floor of
the crate "jail."

Woody watches helplessly as Sid fishes out a roll of
electrical tape from the toolbox and, with an IRREVERENT
CHUCKLE, tapes Buzz to the rocket.

SFX: THUNDERCLAP

A flash of lightning interrupts the moment.

                         SID
            Oh, no...

Sid crosses to the window to see a huge rainstorm commence.
Sullenly, he smacks his head against the window.

                         SID
            Aw, man...!

Woody heaves a SIGH of relief.

Suddenly Sid's face brightens.  He turns his focus from the
rain to the Buzzrocket.

                         SID
                   (as Newscaster)
            Sid Phillips reporting.  Launch of
            the shuttle has been delayed due to
            adverse weather conditions at the
            launch site.  Tomorrow's forecast...

Sid smacks Buzz down on the desk, winds his alarm clock, and
places it next to Buzz.

                         SID
            Sunny.  Ha-ha-ha.  Sweet dreams.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

Andy is being tucked into bed by his mother.  She hands him
his cowboy hat.

                         MRS. DAVIS
            I looked everywhere, honey, but all
            I could find was your hat.

                         ANDY
                   (groggy)
            But what if we leave them behind?

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Oh, don't worry, honey, I'm sure
            we'll find Woody and Buzz before we
            leave tomorrow.

Andy's eyes shut.  Mom turns out the light and quietly exits
the room.

A moving box on the floor, with the words "Andy's Toys!"
scrawled on it, begins to shake from side to side.

                         REX (O.S.)
                   (muffled)
            Aaaah!  I need air!

Rex pops out of the top of the box, COUGHING a packing
styrofoam peanut out of his mouth.  Potato Head appears
beside him.

                         REX
                   (relieved)
            Aa-a-a-a-ah!
                   (COUGH)

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Will you quit moving around?!

                         REX
            I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so
            nervous before I travel.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            How did I get stuck with YOU as a
            moving buddy?

Potato Head drops back down into the box.

                         REX
                   (following Potato Head)
            Everyone else was picked.

BO PEEP

peeks around the corner of one of the boxes and looks up at
Andy fast asleep clutching his cowboy hat.

                         BO PEEP
            Oh, Woody, if only you could see
            how much Andy misses you.

EXT. SID'S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

THUNDER RUMBLES as rain pours down outside the spooky dwelling.

INT. SID'S ROOM

Sid is in bed fast asleep.

Woody struggles to move his milkcrate jail, but with the
weight of the toolbox on top it won't budge.

Woody looks across the desktop at Buzz sitting dejectedly
with the rocket strapped to his back.

                         WOODY
            Ps-s-s-s-t!  Psst!  Hey, Buzz!

No reaction from Buzz.

Woody picks up a stray washer from the desktop and flings it
at Buzz, striking his helmet.

Buzz lifts his head and turns lifelessly to look at Woody.

                         WOODY
            Hey!  Get over here and see if you
            can get this tool box off me.

Buzz just looks away from Woody and bows his head.

                         WOODY
            Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I
            can't do this without you.  I need
            your help.

                         BUZZ
            I can't help.  I can't help anyone.

                         WOODY
            Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can
            get me out of here and then I'll
            get that rocket off you, and we'll
            make a break for Andy's house.

                         BUZZ
            Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's
            the difference.

                         WOODY
            Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall.
            You must not be thinking clearly.

                         BUZZ
            No, Woody, for the first time I am
            thinking clearly.
                   (looking at himself)
            You were right all along.  I'm not
            a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A
            stupid little insignificant toy.

                         WOODY
            Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being
            a toy is a lot better than being a
            Space Ranger.

                         BUZZ
            Yeah, right.

                         WOODY
            No, it is.  Look, over in that
            house is a kid who thinks you are
            the greatest, and it's not because
            you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's
            because you're a TOY!  You are HIS
            toy.

                         BUZZ
            But why would Andy want me?

                         WOODY
            Why would Andy want you?!  Look at
            you!  You're a Buzz Lightyear.  Any
            other toy would give up his moving
            parts just to be you.  You've got
            wings, you glow in the dark, you
            talk, your helmet does that -- that
            whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy.

Woody pauses and looks at himself.

                         WOODY
                   (continued; depressed)
            As a matter of fact you're too cool.
            I mean -- I mean what chance does a
            toy like me have against a Buzz
            Lightyear action figure?  All I can
            do is...

Woody pulls his own pull-string.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            There's a snake in my boots!

Woody bows his head.

                         WOODY
            Why would Andy ever want to play
            with me, when he's got you?
                   (pause)
            I'm the one that should be strapped
            to that rocket.

Woody slumps dejectedly against the crate, his back to Buzz.

Buzz lifts up his foot.

ANGLE: THE SOLE OF BUZZ'S FOOT

The signature "ANDY" reads through the dirt and scuff marks.

Buzz gazes back at Woody.  A look of determination spreads
across his face.

                         WOODY
            Listen Buzz, forget about me.  You
            should get out of here while you can.

Silence.

Woody turns around.

Buzz is gone.

Suddenly, the entire milkcrate begins to shake.  Woody looks
up to see...

BUZZ

He is on top of the milkcrate, trying to push the tool box off.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I
            thought you were --

                         BUZZ
            Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid
            over in that house who needs us.
            Now let's get you out of this thing.

                         WOODY
            Yes Sir!

Both Buzz and Woody push the milkcrate and together, they
finally get it to move but it's slow progress.

                         WOODY
                   (strained)
            Come on, Buzz!  We can do it!

SFX: TRUCK

The two toys stop to look out the window by the workbench.

ANGLE: OUT SID'S BEDROOM WINDOW

With the rain stopped and the sun beginning to rise...

A MOVING TRUCK

can be seen pulling up in front of Andy's house.

                         BUZZ
            Woody!  It's the moving van.

                         WOODY
            We've got to get out of here...NOW.

Buzz braces himself between the tool chest and the wall.

Using his legs, Buzz pushes with all his might.  The toolbox
begins to move.

Woody notices that with every shove Buzz gives to the tool
chest, the milkcrate begins to edge out over the lip of the
desk.

                         WOODY
            C'mon, Buzz.

Finally the gap is wide enough for Woody to jump through.
Woody drops down to the floor below.

                         WOODY
                   (loud whisper)
            Alright.  Buzz!  Hey!  I'm out!

Buzz doesn't hear Woody and continues to shove the toolbox
(and milkcrate) farther out.

                         BUZZ
            ...almost
                   (GRUNT)
            ...there
                   (GRUNT)
            ...

Woody looks up just in time to see the entire toolbox and
milkcrate topple towards him.

                         WOODY
                   (nervous laugh)

The toolbox CRASHES right on top of Woody.

Buzz falls onto the desktop and glances over to Sid, who
stirs...

                         SID
                   (in his sleep)
            I wanna ride the pony...

Sid does not wake.  Buzz heaves a SIGH OF RELIEF, then peers
over the edge of the workbench.

                         BUZZ
            Woody!  Woody?!  Are you alright?!

Woody lifts himself out from under the rubble.

                         WOODY
                   (punch-drunk)
            No, I'm fine...I'm okay...

SFX: ALARM CLOCK

It goes off by Sid's bed.  Woody drops back under the
toolbox and Buzz goes limp.

Sid groggily sits up for a beat, then his eyes light up.

                         SID
            Oh, yeah!  Time for lift-off!

Sid jumps out of bed, grabs Buzz and bolts out of the room.

                         SID (O.S.)
            TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!!

Woody leaps to his feet, runs across the room, and catches
the door just before it closes.  As he swings the door back
open Woody is confronted by...

SCUD

The dog barrels down the hallway straight for Woody.

                         WOODY
            Aaah!  Back!  Back!  Down!  Down!

Woody slams the door shut just in time.  Scud BARKS AND
SCRATCHES at the door.

                         WOODY
                   (out of breath; to himself)
            Okay, what do I do?  Come on Woody,
            think!

Woody looks across the room.

THE MUTANT TOYS

have appeared all around the room.

                         WOODY
            Guys!

The mutant toys all scatter and hide.

                         WOODY
            No, no, no!  Wait!  Wait!  Listen!
            Please!  There's a good toy down
            there and he's -- he's going to be
            blown to bits in a few minutes all
            because of me.  I've gotta save him!
                   (pause)
            -- But I need your help.

No response.

Woody then notices Babyface timidly peeking out of the
shadows from under the bed.

                         WOODY
            Please.  He's my friend.  He's the
            only one I've got.

Babyface crawls out and bangs in code on the side of Sid's
metal bedpost.

The mutant toys emerge from the shadows, and gather around
Woody.  He kneels down into a huddle with them.

                         WOODY
                   (to Babyface)
            Thank you.
                   (to the others)
            Okay.  I think I know what to do.
            We're going to have to break a few
            rules, but if it works, it'll help
            everybody.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM

THE MOVERS cart out the last load.  A forlorn Andy clutches
onto Buzz's "spaceship" box in one hand and his cowboy hat
in the other.

Andy scans the empty room and heaves a sad SIGH.

EXT. BACKYARD SHED

Sid comes out of the she carrying a bunch of materials under
his arm.

                         SID
                   (as Astronaut)
            Houston to Mission Control.  Come
            in, Control.

He drops the junk down beside an inanimate Buzz.

                         SID
                   (continued)
            Launch pad is being constructed!
            Heh-heh.

SID'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Scud is planted right outside Sid's bedroom door, poised to
attack anything that exits.

INT. SID'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Woody has created a little diagram of the house and yard out
of dominoes and Scrabble tiles.  He points to it with a
pencil as he addresses the mutants.

                         WOODY
            All right, listen up.  I need Pump
            Boy here -- Ducky here.  Legs?

LEGS, the toy fishing rod with fashion doll legs, steps
forward from the crowd.

                         WOODY
                   (continued; to Legs)
            You're with Ducky.
                   (to the others)
            RollerBob and I don't move till we
            get the signal.  Clear?

The mutants all give an affirmative nod.

                         WOODY
            Okay, let's move!

The toys all break.

Legs and DUCKY, a duck head Pez dispenser with baby doll
torso and plunger base, rush over to a heating grate and
pull the face plate off the wall.  They disappear into the
heating duct.

INT. HEATING DUCT - CONTINUOUS

Ducky and Legs come to an intersection.  Ducky QUACKS and
they head down the right tunnel.

INT. SID'S ROOM

HAND-IN-THE-BOX, the rubber hand in the Jack-in-the-box,
stacks on top of several mutant toys to reach the doorknob
of the bedroom door.

Woody hops onto ROLLERBOB, a skateboard with a soldier's
upper torso tied to its front.

                         WOODY
            Wind the frog!

WALKING CAR, a Hot Wheels car with baby arms, begins winding
up THE FROG, a tin wind-up frog with monster truck wheels
instead of legs.

INT. SID'S HOUSE/PORCH ATTIC

A bottom of wall insulation is pushed aside to reveal Ducky
and Legs.  They make their way towards a junction box
sitting in the center of the floor.

Ducky and Legs lift the loose junction box.

EXT. SID'S HOUSE/FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS

THE BROKEN PORCH LIGHT

suddenly lifts upward and disappears into the roof.

Ducky extends his Pez neck out of the hole to check that the
coast is clear.

INT. SID'S ROOM

All the toys have manned their positions and wait silently,
their eyes fixed on Woody.

                         WOODY
            Wait for the signal.

INT. PORCH ATTIC

Ducky takes the end of the line off Legs' fishing reel,
hooks it onto himself, and is then lowered down through the
open hole.

EXT. FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS

Hanging halfway down the front door, Ducky begins to swing.
Eventually he swings far enough to reach his destination:
the doorbell.

Ducky presses it.

SFX: DOORBELL

INT. SID'S ROOM

Woody throws his arm down.

                         WOODY
            Go!!

Hand-in-the-box throws open the door and The Frog is let loose.

The Frog zips through Scud's legs and down the hallway.
Scud chases after it and follows it down the stairs.

SFX: DOORBELL

                         HANNAH (O.S.)
            I'll get it!

Woody helps the rest of the mutant toys onto the skateboard.

                         WOODY
            Alright, let's go.

Using his front arms, Rollerbob propels the skateboard and
crew out into the hallway.

INT. SID'S HOUSE/ENTRYWAY

SFX: DOORBELL

Hannah walks to the front door...

                         HANNAH
            I'm coming!  I'm coming!

...and opens it.

EXT./INT. FRONT DOORWAY - CONTINUOUS

Nobody's there.

Hannah doesn't notice Ducky stuck to the porch floor by his
plunger.

THE FROG

zooms down the stairs with Scud BARKING right behind.  The
Frog leaps off the last step, speeds through Hannah's legs
and out the open front door.

Hannah looks back inside at Scud.  In that moment, Ducky
catches the Frog and is quickly reeled upwards back into the
roof.

Scud bursts through Hannah's legs, knocking her over, and
runs out onto the empty porch.

                         HANNAH
                   (annoyed)
            SCUD!!!

Scud suddenly realizes he's been duped, but before he can
get back inside, Hannah slams the front door shut.

                         HANNAH
            Stupid dog.

Scud smashes into the closed door and begins BARKING furiously.

As Hannah storms off into another room she doesn't notice
Woody and the mutants zipping off the stairs and round the
corner, heading straight into the kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

By now RollerBob has really picked up speed.  He shoots
underneath the kitchen table, through the maze of chair
legs, straight towards...

THE PET DOOR

                         WOODY
            Lean back!

The mutants all push back causing the RollerBob to do a
wheelie.  They smash through the doggie door...

EXT. SID'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

...and catapult into the bushes.

The toys peek out from the bush to see Buzz strapped to the
launchpad.  Sid is still in the toolshed.

                         SID (O.S.; AS ASTRONAUT)
            Uh, Mission Control...is the
            launchpad construction complete? --
                   (simulated static)
            Uh, Roger, rocket is now secured to
            guide wire.  We are currently
            obtaining the...ignition sticks.
            Countdown will commence momentarily.
            Stand by --
                   (simulated static)


Ducky, Legs, and the Frog shoot out into the yard from a
drain pipe.  They exchange a thumbs-up with Woody.

                         WOODY
                   (to toys in the bush)
            Let's go!

The mutants disperse to their designated places in the yard.

                         SID (O.S.)
            Hey, Mom?!  Where are the matches?
            Oh, oh, wait, here they are.
            Nevermind...

Woody runs towards Buzz, who spots Woody approaching.

                         BUZZ
                   (loud whisper)
            Woody?!  Great!  Help me out of
            this thing!

Woody stops a few feet away from Buzz.

                         WOODY
            Shhhhhhh!

                         BUZZ
            What?!

                         WOODY
                   (loud whisper)
            It's ok.  Everything's under control.

Woody deliberately falls down limp on the grass.

                         BUZZ
            Woody?!  What are you doing?!

Sid emerges from the tool shed.  Buzz freezes.

                         SID (AS ASTRONAUT)
            Houston, all systems are go.
            Requesting permission to launch --
                   (spotting Woody)
            Hey!  How'd you get out here?

Sid picks up Woody, examines him for a beat and then smiles.

                         SID
            Oh, well, you and I can have a
            cookout later.  Ha-ha-ha...

He sticks a match prominently in Woody's holster and tosses
him onto the grill of an open barbecue.

                         SID (AS ASTRONAUT)
            Houston, do we have permission to
            launch? --
                   (simulated static)
            Uh, Roger, permission granted.  You
            are confirmed at T minus 10 seconds...

During Sid's countdown, all the mutants scurry into their
final positions.

Sid lights a match.

                         SID
                   (continued)
            ...and counting.  Ten!  Nine!
            Eight!  Seven!  Six!  Five!  Four!
            Three!  Two!... One!...

Sid grins menacingly as the match moves towards the fuse.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            Reach for the sky!!

                         SID
            Huh?

Sid pulls back from lighting the fuse.  He turns to look at
Woody still lying lifelessly atop the barbecue except for
the sound emitting from his voice box.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            This town ain't big enough for the
            two of us!

                         SID
            What?!

Sid walks over to Woody and picks him up.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            Somebody's poisoned the water hole...

                         SID
            It's busted.

He raises Woody up, about to throw him away --

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            Who are you callin' busted, Buster?!

Sid stops short and looks at Woody again.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
                   (continued)
            That's right.  I'm talking to YOU,
            Sid Phillips.  We don't like being
            blown up, Sid, or smashed, or
            ripped apart...

While Woody's voice box talks, Sid checks the pullstring.

It isn't moving.  Sid GULPS.

                         SID
            W-w-w-we?

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            That's right.
                   (beat)
            Your toys.

The remains of broken toys in the yard, led by the bedroom
mutants, begin rising from the ground in "NIGHT OF THE
LIVING DEAD" fashion.
The toys march forward, forming a circle around Sid.  Sid is
too frightened to scream or move.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            From now on, you must take good
            care of your toys.  Because if you
            don't, we'll find out, Sid.  We
            toys can see...

Woody's inanimate head rotates 360 degrees.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
                   (continued)
            ...everything.

For a split second Woody's face comes to life.

                         WOODY
                   (regular voice)
            So play nice.

Sid drops Woody and bolts inside the house.

                         SID
            AAAAAAAGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!

Woody and all the toys CHEER VICTORIOUSLY.

INT. SID'S ENTRYWAY

Hannah has just come downstairs carrying a new doll when Sid
rushes up to her.

                         SID
            The toys!  The toys are alive!

Sid eyes Hannah's doll and pats it gently on the head.

                         SID
                   (continued)
            N-N-Nice dolly...

Hannah, sensing Sid's fear, suddenly thrusts the doll in
Sid's face.  He SCREAMS and runs upstairs.  Hannah chases
after him, taunting.

                         HAMM
            What's wrong, Sid?!  Don't you want
            to play with Sally?!

EXT. SID'S BACKYARD

The toys are all congratulating one another.
                         WOODY
            Nice work, fellahs.  Good job.
            Comin' out of the ground -- what a
            touch!  That was a stroke of genius.

                         BUZZ
            Woody!

Woody turns around and looks at Buzz, who's still affixed to
Sid's launchpad.  Buzz extends his hand to Woody.

                         BUZZ
            Thanks.

They shake.

SFX: VAN HORN HONKING

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Everybody say, "Bye, house."

                         ANDY (O.S.)
                   (depressed)
            Bye, house.

Buzz and Woody look in the direction of Andy's house.

ANGLE: ANDY'S DRIVEWAY - THE FAMILY VAN

Through the fence, Andy and his family can be seen getting
into the van.

                         BUZZ
            Woody!  The van!

Woody quickly hoists Buzz off the pole he was tied to.

                         WOODY
                   (to mutant toys)
            We gotta run!  Thanks, guys.

With the rocket still taped to Buzz, the two toys sprint
towards the fence.

SFX: VAN ENGINE STARTING

                         WOODY
            Quick!

Woody easily slips through the slats in the fence, but
Buzz's rocket causes him to become stuck.

EXT. ANDY'S DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

Woody has climbed up on to the rear bumper of the van before
realizing that Buzz is missing.  He looks back to discover
Buzz stuck in the fence.

                         BUZZ
            Just go!  I'll catch up!

Woody jumps down and runs back for Buzz.

The van begins pulling out of the driveway.

Woody tugs on a loosened slat and breaks Buzz free of the
fence.

The two toys run out into the street just in time to see the
van driving off down the street.

SFX: TRUCK ENGINE

Woody and Buzz turn around.

THE MOVING VAN

drives right over them.  Woody and Buzz SCREAM, ducking just
in time.

After the truck passes, Buzz runs after it with Woody a few
steps behind.

                         BUZZ
            Come on!

ANGLE: SID'S FRONT PORCH

Scud is lying on the porch when he suddenly perks up at the
sight of the two tiny toys running down the street after the
moving truck.

Scud bears his teeth and GROWLS.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET

Buzz runs up close to the truck with Woody still back a few
paces.

A STRAP

dangles off the back of the truck.  Buzz makes a leap for it
and grabs hold.  He climbs up the strap and onto the bumper.

Woody then lunges for the strap but it stays just out of reach.

                         BUZZ
            You can do it, Woody.

Woody gives a mighty leap and catches hold of the strap.

                         WOODY
            Whew, I made it!

Woody begins climbing up when suddenly Buzz goes pale.
Woody looks behind him to see...

SCUD

The dog leaps forward and bites down on one of Woody's legs.

                         WOODY
                   (kicking Scud with
                   other foot)
            Aaaaaahh!!  Get away, you stupid
            dog!  Down!  Down!

Scud tugs on Woody, pulling him down to the end of the strap.

                         BUZZ
            Hold on, Woody!

                         WOODY
            I can't do it!  Take care of Andy
            for me!

                         BUZZ
            NO-O-O-O-O-O-O!!

Buzz leaps off of the truck and onto Scuds snout.  He grabs
Scud's eyelids and snaps them hard.  Scud YELPS, letting go
of Woody.  The dog bucks wildly with Buzz hanging onto his
face.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!

The moving truck continues down the street leaving Buzz and
Scud behind.

Still hanging onto the strap, Woody scrambles up onto the
bumper.  He unlocks the back door of the truck and tries to
lift up the heavy door.

Suddenly, the family van and moving truck come to a stop at
a traffic light.

Woody slams into the door, causing it to fly upward taking
Woody with it.

Hanging from the door, Woody scans the inside of the truck
until he spots what he's looking for.

A PILE OF MOVING BOXES

with the words "ANDY'S TOYS" written on them in crayon.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET

Scud flings Buzz off his face.  Buzz goes tumbling under a
parked car.  Scud runs over to the car, but is too big to
get under it.

INT. BACK OF MOVING TRUCK

Woody rips into one of Andy's boxes.

ANGLE: INSIDE OF BOX

All the toys wince and MOAN as they cover their eyes from
the sudden brightness.

                         TOYS
            What?!

                         REX
            Are we there already?

                         SLINKY
            Woody?!  How'd you --

Woody's response is to slide the box aside and begin
rummaging through the next box.

Slinky, Potato Head, Rex and the other toys GRUMBLE IN
CONFUSION as they poke their heads up out of the first box.

                         WOODY
            Ah-hah!  There you are!!

Woody pulls the RC Car and its remote out of the second box.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Hey!  What's he doing?

Woody runs to the back of the truck and throws the RC Car
out onto the street.  The other toys SCREAM in horror.

                         REX
            He's at it again!

INTERCUT - EXT. STREET/INT. REAR OF MOVING TRUCK

Woody turns on the remote and steers the RC car past Scud
and under the parked car where Buzz is hiding.

RC's motor WHIRRS happily at the sight of Buzz.

The traffic light turns green allowing the van and truck to
cross the intersection.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
                   (pointing at Woody)
            Get him!!!

All the toys pour out of their boxes and CHARGE on Woody.

                         WOODY
            Ah-h!!  Ah-h!  No, no!

Woody continues to steer the remote while trying to avoid
the angry mob of toys.

Buzz jumps on to the RC car and they zoom back towards the
moving truck.

Scud is right on their heels and is about to chomp down on
Buzz --

Rocky picks up Woody and spins him over his head.

                         WOODY
            No, no, no!  Wait!
                   (as Rocky spins him)
            Whoa-Whoa-Whoa...!

-- The RC car suddenly swerves from Scud's jaws and starts
doing doughnuts (matching Woody's) in the middle of the street.

                         BUZZ
                   (spinning)
            Whoa-Whoa-Whoa...!

Rocky throws Woody to the floor.

-- RC resumes his course straight down the street with Scud
giving close chase.

Hamm leaps off a pile of boxes and onto Woody.

                         HAMM
            Pig pile!!

-- The RC car hops up in the air, tossing Buzz up and off.
Buzz manages to land back on RC, but facing backwards.

ANGLE: TRAFFIC LIGHT

It changes red again and the wall of cross traffic resumes.

Buzz and the RC car drive straight into it.

Scud blindly follows them into the traffic and skids to a
halt just missing a car.  The car swerves and CRASHES into
another car.  Soon there is a multi-car pile up that
encircles Scud, entrapping the dog.

Buzz and the RC car emerge from the intersection safely on
the other side.

INT. BACK OF MOVING TRUCK

The mob of toys lift up Woody (still holding the remote) and
head for the open back.

                         WOODY
            No wait!  You don't understand!
            Buzz is out there!  We've gotta
            help him!!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Toss 'im overboard!

                         WOODY
            No, no, no, wait!

The toys toss him out into the road.  As the truck drives
off, the toys CHEER.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            So long Woody!

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

SFX: CAR HORN

Woody turns around and ducks just in time as a car passes
over him.

Shaken, Woody tries to get up again when...

BUZZ & RC

come barreling towards him.

                         BUZZ
            Who-o-o-oa!  Woody!

The RC Car sweeps up Woody and keeps driving.

Woody finds himself sitting in front of Buzz (still holding
the remote).

                         WOODY
            Well, thanks for the ride.

                         BUZZ
                   (pointing ahead)
            Look out!!

The toys are about to slam into the rear tire of the car
that had passed over Woody earlier.

Woody SCREAMS and gives the steering wheel on the remote a
hard left, missing the tire by inches.  The RC Car moves up
under the car.

                         WOODY
            Now let's catch up to that truck!

ANGLE: RC REMOTE

Woody flicks a switch from "ON" to "TURBO."

The RC Car speeds up towards the moving truck.

INT. BACK OF MOVING TRUCK

The toys are busy CONGRATULATING one another when Lenny, the
wind-up binoculars, glances out the back and spots Buzz and
Woody.

                         LENNY
            Guys!  Guys!  Woody's riding RC!
            And Buzz is with him!

                         TOYS
            What?!!!

The toys rush to the edge of the open truck.  Bo picks up
Lenny and looks through him.

ANGLE: BINOCULAR VIEW OF BUZZ & WOODY

                         BO PEEP
            It is Buzz!  Woody was telling the
            truth!

                         SLINKY
            What have we done?!

                         REX
            Great.  Now I have guilt.
EXT. STREET/BACK OF MOVING TRUCK

The RC Car begins to gain on the truck.

                         WOODY
            We're almost there.

                         BO PEEP
            Rocky!  The ramp!

Rocky, the wrestler doll, rushes over to a lever on the side
of the back.  The sign above it reads "RAMP: UP/DOWN."
Rocky pushes down hard on the lever.  The ramp begins to lower.

Woody & Buzz look up to see the ramp about to come down
right on top of them.

                         BUZZ
            Look out!!

The RC Car pulls back just before the heavy ramp slams into
the road.  Sparks fly everywhere from the metal scraping the
pavement.

                         SLINKY
                   (to other toys)
            Quick!  Hold on to my tail!

Potato Head and Rex grabs on to Slinky's tail allowing
Slinky's front end to jump off the truck and onto the ramp.

Slinky leans forward with his paw outstretched to Woody.
Woody hands the remote to Buzz and leans forward to grab
Slinky's hand.

ANGLE: WOODY & SLINKY'S HANDS

They grab hold of one another.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            That a boy, Slink!!

All of a sudden, the RC Car begins to slow down pulling
Slinky's front end off the ramp.

                         SLINKY
            Woody!!

His slinky middle begins to stretch and stretch...

                         SLINKY
            Woody!  Speed up!

                         WOODY
                   (to Buzz)
            Speed up!

                         BUZZ
            The batteries!  They're running out!

RC's headlight eyes sag.  The car slows even more.

As Slinky continues stretching.  The RC Car begins to weave
side-to-side like a water skier.

                         SLINKY
            Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!

INT. FAMILY VAN

With Mom and Andy preoccupied, baby Molly looks in her
sideview mirror.

ANGLE: PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR

The RC Car (w/ Woody and Buzz) weaves into view and then
back out.

Molly SQUEALS with delight.

EXT. STREET/BACK OF MOVING TRUCK

With Slinky's mid-section stretched to the limit, he begins
to lose his grip on Woody.

                         SLINKY
            I can't hold on much longer!

                         WOODY
            Slink!  Hang on!

Slinky's hand slips, sending his front shooting back into
the moving truck and knocking over all the toys.

The RC Car sputters to a stop.

Woody and Buzz watch in vain as the family van and moving
truck disappear.

Buzz tosses the remote to the ground in frustration.

                         WOODY
                   (sarcastic)
            Great!

BEAT

                         BUZZ
            Woody!  The rocket!

                         WOODY
            The match!

Woody pulls out the match from his holster that Sid had put
there earlier.

                         WOODY
                   (continued)
            Yes!  Thank you, Sid!

Woody runs around behind Buzz, strikes the match against
RC's back tire, and is about to light the fuse when...

A CAR

whizzes right over them, blowing out the match.

Woody clenches the burnt match in his hands and falls
prostrate to the ground.

                         WOODY
            No-o-o!  No-no-no-no!  No-o-o!

Unable to watch a cowboy cry, Buzz bows his head, causing
his helmet to block the sun from Woody.

As Buzz's shadow passes over him, Woody stops whimpering and
looks at his hand.

A WHITE HOT DOT

like the one generated from Sid's magnifying glass, appears
on the back of Woody's hand.

Woody leaps up, grabs Buzz's helmet and aligns it so the
white dot hits the tip of the fuse.

                         BUZZ
            Woody?!  What are you doing?

                         WOODY
            Hold still, Buzz!

The fuse lights.

                         WOODY
            Ha-ha!!

                         BUZZ
            You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.

Woody jumps back onto the car then suddenly stops smiling.

                         WOODY
            Wait a minute...I just lit a rocket.
            Rockets explo --

SFX: ROCKET EXPLOSION

The RC Car rockets forward.  Speeding along the dividing
line in the road, it easily passes car after car until the
moving truck can be seen on the horizon.

EXT. BACK OF MOVING TRUCK

The toys are gathered around Slinky, his spring splayed out
on the floor.

                         SLINKY
            I shoulda held on longer.

Lenny looks out the back again.

                         LENNY
            Look!  Look!  It's Woody and Buzz!
            Comin' up fast!

The toys run to the opening and CHEER.

ANGLE: BUZZ AND WOODY

The rocket is so strong that it begins to lift Buzz and
Woody off the RC Car.  Woody manages to continue holding
onto RC -- but not for long.

The toys CHEERING turns to SCREAMING as they rush to get out
of the way of the oncoming "RC rocket."

                         REX
            Take cover!!

Woody is forced to let go of the RC Car.

They separate, sending the two toys upward and RC into the
back of the truck.

RC smashes into Potato Head, sending all of his parts flying.

EXT. SKY - BUZZ AND WOODY

The rocket hurtles upward higher and higher.

                         WOODY
            Ahhh!! This is the part where we
            blow up!

                         BUZZ
            Not today!

Buzz confidently presses the button on his chest.

WINGS

jut out of Buzz, severing the tape that holds him to rocket.
The toys separate from the rocket just before it BLOWS UP.

The toys plummet.

                         WOODY
                   (covering his eyes)
            Ah-h-h-h-h!!

Just then Buzz banks under some power lines and soars upward
again.  Woody takes a peek.

They're flying.

                         WOODY
            Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!

                         BUZZ
            This isn't flying.  This is
            falling -- with style!

                         WOODY
            Ha ha!!  To Infinity and Beyond!!

They soar gracefully towards the moving truck, but then pass
over it.

                         WOODY
            Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!

                         BUZZ
            We're not aiming for the truck!

ANGLE: FAMILY VAN

Buzz and Woody fly right over the van's sun roof and then
drop into the car.

INT. FAMILY VAN - CONTINUOUS

Before anyone can notice, Woody and Buzz land in an open box
in the back seat right next to Andy.

Andy turns to discover the limp Buzz and Woody lying in the
box.

                         ANDY
            Hey!  Wow!

                         MRS. DAVIS
            What?  What is it?

                         ANDY
                   (picking up the toys)
            Woody!  Buzz!

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Oh, great, you found them.  Where
            were they?

                         ANDY
            Here!  In the car!

                         MRS. DAVIS
            See?  Now, what did I tell you?
            Right where you left them.

Andy hugs both toys.

CLOSE UP - WOODY AND BUZZ

They give each other a knowing wink.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. ANDY'S NEW HOUSE - CHRISTMAS MORNING - LIVING ROOM BAY
WINDOW

Through the gently falling snow, the Davis family can be
seen around the Christmas tree unwrapping presents.

                         ANDY
            Which one can I open first?

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Let's let Molly open one.

INT. ANDY'S NEW HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - CHRISTMAS TREE

One of the Christmas bulbs moves aside to reveal...

THE SARGENT

The plastic green soldier spies on the Davis family with his
binoculars.  He turns and motions back into the tree.

INT. CHRISTMAS TREE

A baby monitor sits wedged between some branches supported
by several green army men.  One of the soldiers turns it on.

INT. ANDY'S NEW BEDROOM

The receiving end of the monitor is atop Andy's night stand.
It CRACKLES WITH STATIC.

                         SARGENT (O.S.)
                   (over the monitor)
            Frankincense, this is Myrrh.  Come
            in, Frankincense.

Buzz sits on the edge of Andy's bed while Hamm rests on the
nightstand alongside the monitor.  They listen intently.

                         HAMM
                   (to the room)
            Hey, heads up everybody!  It's
            showtime.

Woody and the rest of the toys are MINGLING together like a
typical office Christmas party.

                         REX
            Oh!  It's time!

The toys all stop and run towards the monitor.

Woody is about to follow when a crook pulls him backwards to
reveal...

BO PEEP

                         WOODY
            Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!
                   (rubbing his neck)
            There's gotta be a less painful way
            to get my attention.

                         BO PEEP
            Merry Christmas, Sheriff.

She smiles and points her crook upwards to her sheep perched
on a shelf dangling mistletoe.

                         WOODY
            Say, isn't that mistletoe?

                         BO PEEP
            Mm-hmmmmm.

Bo drops her crook, dips Woody and KISSES him.

The rest of the toys have congregated below the monitor
restless with "excitement" not fear.

                         REX
                   (to Slinky)
            Maybe Andy'll get another dinosaur,
            like a leaf-eater.  That way, I
            could play the, uh, dominant
            predator.  Ha ha ha!

Slinky LAUGHS with Rex.

                         BUZZ
            Quiet everyone, quiet!

                         SARGENT (O.S.)
                   (over monitor)
            Molly's first present i-i-is...Mrs.
            Potato Head.  Repeat.  A Mrs.
            Potato Head.

                         HAMM
            Way to go, Idaho!

All the toys CONGRATULATE Potato Head.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Gee, I better shave.

Potato Head whips off his moustache piece.

Woody climbs up onto the bed and joins Buzz.  Lipstick now
covers Woody's face.

                         SARGENT (O.S.)
                   (over monitor)
            Come in, Frankincense.  Andy is now
            opening his first present --
                   (STATIC)


Buzz bangs on the side of the monitor.  Nothing.

                         WOODY
            Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not
            worried, are you?

                         SARGENT (O.S.)
                   (over monitor)
            I can't quite make out --
                   (STATIC)

                         BUZZ
                   (defensively)
            Me?  No, no, no, no...
                   (beat)
            Are you?

                         WOODY
                   (laughing)
            Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly
            get that is worse than you?!

We TRUCK OUT through the window to the EXT. as we HEAR...

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Oh, what is it?  What is it?

SFX: BARKING

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Wow!  A puppy!

We ZOOM BACK through the window to a CLOSE UP of Buzz and
Woody.

They look at one another with a half-smile, half-grimace and
LAUGH WEAKLY.

                                            FADE OUT.

                         "TOY STORY"

FADE IN:

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM

A row of moving boxes lie on the floor of the room.  They
are drawn up in crayon to look like a miniature Western town.
The bedroom is lined with cloud wallpaper giving the
impression of sky.

One of the boxes has a children's illustrated "WANTED"
poster of a Mr. Potato Head taped to it.

A MR. POTATO HEAD DOLL is set in front of the poster.  The
VOICE OVER of ANDY, a 6-year-old boy, can be heard acting
out all the voices of the scene.

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            Alright everyone, this is a stick-
            up!  Don't anybody move!  Now empty
            that safe!

A GROUP OF TOYS have been crowded together in front of the
"BANK" box.

Andy's hand lowers a CERAMIC PIGGY BANK in front of Mr.
Potato Head and shakes out a pile of coins to the floor.  Mr.
Potato Head kisses the coins.

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            Ooh!  Money.  Money.  Money.
                   (kissing noises)


A porcelain figurine of the shepherdess, BO PEEP, is brought
into the scene.

                         ANDY (AS BO PEEP)
            Stop it!  Stop it, you mean old
            potato!

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            Quiet Bo Peep, or your sheep get
            run over!

The companion porcelain sheep are placed in the center of a
Hot Wheels track loop.

                         ANDY (AS SHEEP)
            Heeeeelp!  BAAAAA!  Heeeelp us!

                         ANDY (AS BO PEEP)
            Oh, no!  Not my sheep!  Somebody do
            something!

WOODY, a pull-string doll cowboy, enters into the scene
opposite the inanimate spud.

Andy's hand pulls on the ring in the center of Woody's back.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            Reach for the sky.

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            Oh, no!  Sheriff Woody!!

                         ANDY (AS WOODY)
            I'm here to stop you, One-Eyed Bart.

Andy's hand pulls out one of Mr. Potato Head's eyes.

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            Doooooh!  How'd you know it was me!

                         ANDY (AS WOODY)
            Are you gonna come quietly?

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            You can't touch me Sheriff!  I
            brought my attack dog with a built-
            in force field!

Andy places a TOY DOG, with a SLINKY for a mid-section, in
front of Mr. Potato Head and stretches him out.

                         ANDY (AS WOODY)
            Well I brought my DINOSAUR, who
            eats force field dogs!!

Andy reveals a PLASTIC TYRANNOSAURUS REX, who stomps on the
Slinky Dog.

                         ANDY (AS DINOSAUR)
            AAAAR!  ROAR-ROAR-ROAR!

                         ANDY (AS SLINKY DOG)
            YIPE!  YIPE-YIPE-YIPE!

                         ANDY (AS WOODY)
            You're goin' to jail, Bart.

Andy picks up Mr. Potato Head and places him in a baby crib
in the room.

A cardboard sign is taped to the bars with the word "JAIL"
written in crayon.

                         ANDY (AS WOODY)
            Say good-bye to the wife and
            tatertots.

Andy's 1-year-old sister, MOLLY, crawls over and picks up Mr.
Potato Head.  She sucks on him for a beat then proceeds to
pound the toy repeatedly against the rail of her crib,
forcing some of his parts loose.

Andy, wearing a cowboy hat himself, picks up Woody off the
floor.

                         ANDY
                   (pulling Woody's string)
            You saved the day again, Woody.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            You're my favorite deputy.

BEGIN TITLES

SONG "YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND IN ME" plays while Andy does
various activities with Woody:

-- Andy turns the Western town boxes around to reveal cows
drawn on the other side.  He grabs a jump rope and pretends
Woody is lassoing the cattle.

                         ANDY
            C'mon, let's wrangle up the cattle.

-- Andy then rides Woody around on an RC (remote control)
car, and herds the remaining "cow" boxes under Molly's crib.

INT. STAIRWELL

-- Andy places Woody on the top of the stairwell banister
allowing the doll to slide downstairs.  Andy races ahead and
catches him at the bottom.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS LIVING ROOM

-- Andy & Woody fall into the La-Z-Boy chair and spin around
and around.

Next, Andy uses the La-Z-Boy foot rest as a catapult.

Andy flings Woody across the room to the sofa.

                         ANDY
                   (raising his arms)
            Score!

SONG ENDS

Woody lies limp on the sofa while Andy is heard talking to
his mother.

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Wow!  Cool!

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Whadda ya think?

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!

ANGLE: THE ADJOINING DINING ROOM

MRS. DAVIS, Andy's thirty eight-year-old mom, has just
finished decorating the area with streamers and balloons.  A
banner is draped across the archway.  It reads: "Happy
Birthday Andy."

Woody's frozen face stares in the direction of the birthday
decorations.

                         ANDY
            Can we leave this up 'til we move?

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Well, sure, we can leave it up.

                         ANDY
            Yeah!

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Now go get Molly.  Your friends are
            going to be here any minute.

                         ANDY
            Okay.

Andy picks up Woody from the couch and runs upstairs.

                         ANDY
            It's party time, Woody!

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Andy and Woody enter the room.  Molly is still banging
Potato Head against her crib railing.  Andy tips Woody's hat
at her.

                         ANDY
            Howdy, Little Lady!

He deposits Woody on the bed and pulls his string one last
time.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            Somebody's poisoned the waterhole.

                         ANDY
                   (picking up Molly)
            C'mon, Molly.  Oh, you're getting
            heavy!
                   (to Woody)
            See ya later, Woody.

Andy exits.

END TITLES

Woody's eyes come to life.  The cowboy doll sits up, his
expression changing from a smile to worry.

                         WOODY
                   (to himself)
            Pull my string!  The birthday
            party's today?!

Woody thinks.

                         WOODY
                   (to the room)
            Okay, everybody.  Coast is clear.

The bedroom comes alive.  TOYS emerge from the toy box, the
closet, the shelves, etc... in a flurry of activity.

POTATO HEAD, his body parts strewn across the floor, sits
himself upright and begins to re-assemble himself.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Ages three and up.  It's on my box.
            Ages three and up!  I'm not
            supposed to be babysitting Princess
            Drool.

HAMM, the piggy bank, flips one last penny into his coin
slot.  Potato Head walks up to him.  All his facial pieces
are in the wrong slots.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Hey, Hamm!  Look!  I'm Picasso!
                         HAMM
            I don't get it.

Hamm walks away.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            You uncultured swine!
                   (to someone O.S.)
            What are you looking at, ya hockey
            puck?!

Potato Head walks past, revealing a hockey puck figurine.

Woody sits on the edge of the bed observing all the activity.
He turns to a plastic green army man, SARGENT, standing on
the night stand.

                         WOODY
            Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?

                         SARGENT
                   (saluting)
            Sir!  No Sir!

                         WOODY
            Okay, thank you.  At ease.

Woody hops off the bed.

                         WOODY
            Hey, Slinky?

                         SLINKY (O.S.)
            Right here, Woody!

A toy Slinky dog, SLINKY, appears from under the bed pushing
out a checker board set.  He begins to place the checkers on
the board.

                         SLINKY
            I'm red this time.

                         WOODY
            No, Slink --

                         SLINKY
            Oh...well alright, you can be red
            if you want.

                         WOODY
            Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad
            news.

                         SLINKY
            Bad news?!

                         WOODY
            Sh-h-h-h-h!!

Woody covers up Slinky's mouth, aware that the other toys in
the room are watching.  He leans in close to Slinky.

                         WOODY
                   (whispering)
            Just gather everyone up for a staff
            meeting and be happy!!

                         SLINKY
            Got it.

Slinky shuffles off.

                         WOODY
            Be HAPPY!

Slinky perks up his gait and LAUGHS HARD.

Woody proceeds in the other direction.  He passes a toy
ROBOT and SNAKE partially hidden under the bedspread.

                         WOODY
                   (to the room)
            Staff meeting, everybody.
                   (aside)
            Snake, Robot -- podium duty.

Robot and Snake come out from under the bed and reluctantly
follow Woody.

Woody walks past an Etch-A-Sketch, ETCH, going the other
direction.

                         WOODY
            Hey Etch!  Draw!

Both Etch and Woody whip around like gunfighters.

Before Woody can fully extend his arm out, the Etch-A-Sketch
etches a gun on its screen.

                         WOODY
                   (pretending to be shot)
            Oh!! You got me again, Etch! You've
            been working on that draw.  Fastest
            knobs in the west.

Slinky passes a group of toys on the floor.

                         SLINKY
            Got a staff meeting, you guys, come
            on, let's go!

Robot and Snake begin constructing a podium made out of
Legos and a Tinker Toy tub while Woody searches the floor.

                         WOODY
            Now where is that -- ?  Aw, hey,
            who moved my doodle pad way over here?

Woody spots the doodle pad on the floor by the desk and
walks over to it.  As he reaches down to pick it up...

REX, the plastic dinosaur, jumps out to scare Woody.

                         REX
            ROOAAAARR!!!

                         WOODY
                   (unaffected)
            Oh, how ya doin', Rex?

Rex suddenly turns timid.

                         REX
            Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.

                         WOODY
            I was close to being scared that time.

Woody heads back to the podium.  Rex follows.

                         REX
            I'm going for fearsome here, but I
            just don't feel it.  I think I'm
            just coming off as annoying.

A crook suddenly grabs Woody's neck and jerks him towards BO
PEEP, the porcelain figurine.

                         WOODY
                   (choking)
            Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.

                         BO PEEP
            I wanted to thank you, Woody, for
            saving my flock.

                         WOODY
                   (blushing)
            Oh, hey - it was nothing.

                         BO PEEP
            Whadda ya say I get someone else to
            watch the sheep tonight?

                         WOODY
                   (very flustered)
            Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I...

Bo saunters back towards her lamp stand, passing a stack of
ABC blocks.

                         BO PEEP
            Remember, I'm just a couple of
            blocks away.

Woody is left lovestruck.

All the rest of the toys in the room are filing past Slinky.

                         SLINKY
            Come on, come on!  Smaller toys up
            front.

Woody remains lovestruck in the middle of the room.

                         SLINKY
            Hey, Woody!  C'mon!

Woody snaps out of his trance and rushes over to the podium.

The toys crowd together as Woody steps up to the podium.
MIKE, a toy tape recorder, waddles up next to Woody and
indicates his microphone.

                         MIKE
            Ahem!

                         WOODY
                   (grabbing microphone)
            Oh, thanks, Mike.
                   (to the crowd)
            Okay --

SFX: FEEDBACK

                         WOODY
                   (to Mike)
            Oh, whoa, step back --

Mike waddles back a step to stop the feedback.

                         WOODY
            Hello?  Check?  Better?  Great.
            Everybody hear me?  Up on the
            shelf, can you hear me?  Great!
            Okay, first item today...oh, yeah.
            Has everyone picked a moving buddy?

The toys all MOAN.

                         HAMM
            Moving buddy?!  You can't be serious!

                         REX
            Well I didn't know we were supposed
            to have one already.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
                   (waving his arm out
                   its socket)
            Do we have to hold hands?

The toys LAUGH and SNICKER.

                         WOODY
            Oh, yeah, you guys think this is a
            big joke.  We've only got one week
            left before the move.  I don't want
            any toys left behind.  A moving
            buddy -- if you don't have one, get
            one!
                   (checking the pad)
            Alright, next...uh...oh, yes.
            Tuesday night's "Plastic Corrosion
            Awareness" meeting was, I think, a
            big success and we want to thank Mr.
            Spell for putting that on for us.
            Thank you, Mr. Spell.

The words "You're welcome" scroll across Mr. Spell's display
screen as he speaks.

                         MR. SPELL
            You're welcome.

                         WOODY
            Ok, uh...oh yes.  One minor note
            here...
                   (under his breath)
            Andy's birthday party's been moved
            to today.
                   (full voice)
            Next we have --

The toys all PANIC.

                         REX
            What?!  Whadda ya mean, the party's
            today?!  His birthday's not 'til
            next week!!

                         HAMM
            What's going on down there?  Is Mom
            losing her marbles?!

                         WOODY
            Well, obviously she wanted to have
            the party before the move.  I'm not
            worried.  You shouldn't be worried.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Of course Woody ain't worried!
            He's been Andy's favorite since
            kindergarten!

                         SLINKY
            Hey, hey!  Come on, Potato Head!
            If Woody says it's all right, then,
            well, darnit, it's good enough for
            me.  Woody has never steered us
            wrong before.

While Slinky speaks, Potato Head takes off his mouth and
mimes kissing his own butt.

                         WOODY
            C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and
            birthday we go through this.

                         REX
            But what if Andy gets another
            dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just
            don't think I can take that kind of
            rejection.

                         WOODY
            Hey, listen, no one's getting
            replaced.  This is Andy we're
            talking about.

Woody steps down from the podium and walks towards the crowd.

                         WOODY
                   (continued)
            It doesn't matter how much we're
            played with.  What matters is that
            we're here for Andy when he needs
            us.  That's what we're made for.
            Right?
Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.

                         HAMM
            Pardon me.  I hate to break up the
            staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE!
            Birthday guests at three o'clock!

                         WOODY
            Stay calm, everyone!!

Too late.  The toys PANIC and stampede over Woody towards
the bedroom window, leaving him alone on the floor.

                         WOODY
            Uh, meeting adjourned.

The toys all crowd around the bedroom window, trying to get
a peek outside.

                         HAMM
            Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at
            all those presents?!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            I can't see a thing!

Unable to see over the crowd, Potato Head pulls his eyes out
of his head and holds them up over the other toys.

ANGLE: TOY'S POV OF ANDY'S FRONT YARD

CHILDREN file towards the front door carrying presents.

                         HAMM
            Yessir, we're next month's garage
            sale fodder for sure.

                         REX
                   (panicked)
            Any dinosaur-shaped ones?

                         HAMM
            Ah, for crying out loud, they're
            all in boxes, you idiot!

The presents keep coming.

                         REX
            They're getting bigger.

                         SLINKY
            Wait!  There's a nice little one
            over there!

At first, the kid's present appears to be a little box, but
then the kid turns -- the present is four feet long.  The
toys SCREAM.

                         MR. SPELL
            Spell the word "trashcan."

                         REX
            We're doomed!

Down on the floor, Woody smacks his hand to his forehead in
surrender.

                         WOODY
            Alright!  Alright!

The toys turn inside and look down at Woody.

                         WOODY
                   (continued)
            If I send out the troops, will you
            all calm down?

                         REX
            Yes!  Yes!  We promise!

                         WOODY
            Okay, save your batteries!

                         HAMM
            Eh, very good, Woody.  That's using
            the old noodle.

Woody jumps up onto Andy's bed and turns to the Sargent on
the nightstand.

                         WOODY
            Sargent.  Establish a recon post
            downstairs.  Code red.  You know
            what to do.

                         SARGENT
            Yes SIR!

The green army man hops down to the floor where a "BUCKET O'
SOLDIERS" sits.

                         SARGENT
            Alright men, you heard him.  Code
            Red!  Repeat: We are at Code Red!
            Recon plan Charlie.  Execute!
            Let's move move move!!

THE GREEN ARMY MEN file out of the bucket and march in
formation across the bedroom floor.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Andy's door creaks open and a lone army man ventures forth
to make sure the coast is clear.  Satisfied, he motions for
the others to proceed.  Squads of soldiers march into the
hall carrying a baby monitor and a jump rope.

The army men each leapfrog behind the stairway banisters and
hold their positions while the Sargent surveys the scene
below through his binoculars.

ANGLE: SARGENT'S BINOCULAR VIEW OF DOWNSTAIRS

Directly below, Mrs. Davis passes through the hallway
rounding up Andy and all his birthday guests.

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Okay, c'mon kids!  Everyone in the
            living room.  It's almost time for
            the presents.

Once Mrs. Davis and the children are out of sight, the
Sargent motions to his men with a silent hand signal.

TWO PARATROOPERS jump out through the railing, parachuting
down to the floor below.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

The paratroopers sweep the area with their plastic rifles,
then give the "all clear" sign.

The jump rope is lowered, and more soldiers rappel down.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM

The toys race towards the nightstand where Woody has placed
the receiving half of the baby monitor.

                         WOODY
            And this --
                   (turning on the baby monitor)
            -- is how we find out what is in
            those presents.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY

The green army men march in formation across the floor when
suddenly...

SFX: FOOTSTEPS

Can be heard approaching from behind the connecting kitchen
door.  Immediately the Sargent signals for his men to freeze
in their various classic action poses.

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Okay, who's hungry?  Here come the
            chips.  I've got Cool Ranch and
            Barbeque --

The door opens and Mrs. Davis' foot comes down hard on top
of a soldier.

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Owww!  What in the world -- ?  Oh,
            I thought I told him to pick these up.

With a sweep of her foot, she brushes the army men out of
her path and continues on to the living room.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM

                         REX
            Shouldn't they be there by now?
            What's taking them so long?!

                         WOODY
            Hey, these guys are professionals.
            They're the best.  C'mon, they're
            not lying down on the job.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY

As soon as Mom is gone, the Sargent motions for his men to
proceed toward a nearby houseplant that looks into the
living room.

The Sargent then notices an injured soldier struggling to
drag himself forward -- a casualty of Mrs. Davis' foot.  The
Sargent helps the injured soldier to his feet.

                         WOUNDED SOLDIER
                   (moans)
            Go on without me.  Just go!

                         SLINKY
            A good soldier never leaves a man
            behind.

The Sargent motions to the remaining men above.  They lower
themselves via jump rope, riding the baby monitor.  Once
downstairs, they hustle the baby monitor towards the
houseplant.  Suddenly...

A BALL

bounces into the hallway, followed by the sound of footsteps
and kid clamor.

The Sargent, supporting his wounded man, reaches the plant,
right on the heels of the squad with the baby monitor.  They
conceal themselves in the house plant just before the
children run by.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS - HOUSE PLANT - CONTINUOUS

While the baby monitor is set in place, A MEDIC evaluates
the wounded soldier and gives the "thumb's up" signal.

The Sargent scans the party with his binoculars.

ANGLE: BINOCULAR VIEW OF BIRTHDAY PRESENTS

The pile of brightly wrapped gifts sits atop the living room
coffee table.

                         SARGENT (O.S.)
            There they are.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM

The toys perk up as STATIC suddenly emits from the baby
monitor.

                         SARGENT (O.S.)

            Mrs. Potato Head...Mrs. Potato
            Head...Mrs. Potato Head...
                   (off Rex's look)
            Hey, I can dream, can't I?

                         SARGENT (O.S.)
                   (over monitor)
            The bow's coming off...he's ripping
            the wrapping paper...it's
            a...it's...it's a lunchbox!  We've
            got a lunchbox, here!

            A lunchbox...?!

                         SLINKY
            For lunch.  Heh heh heh...

            Ok, second present...it appears to
            be...okay, it's bed sheets.

The toys CHEER WITH RELIEF.

                         HAMM
            Yeah, alright!!

Hamm gives Potato Head a congratulatory pat on the back,
sending his facial features flying.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Hey, watch it!

The platoon is preparing to exit the plant when...

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Wait a minute.  Oooh, what do we
            have here?!

The Sargent lifts his binoculars back to his eyes.

Mrs. Davis can be seen opening the closet and pulling out
another large present.

cutting off the Sargent.

                         REX
            It's a WHAT?! WHAT IS IT?!!!

Rex grabs a leg of the nightstand and shakes it, making the
monitor drop to the floor.  The impact causes the batteries
to roll out.

                         REX
            Oh, no!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Oh, ya big lizard!  Now we'll never

                   (sarcastic)
            Way to go, Rex.

Everyone rushes to the fallen monitor.  Potato Head tries to
correctly insert the batteries.

                         WOODY
            No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em
            around!

Head aside.

            Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear?

            come --

Frantic, Rex slams into a trashcan and falls over.

Everyone scurries to their places as the KIDS' FOOTSTEPS
grow louder.

Woody falls limp in his spot on the bed just as...

Andy's bedroom door flies open and a flood of children's
feet rush in.

                         FRIEND #1
            Hey, look!  His lasers light up.
                         ANDY
            Take that, Zurg!

Woody is flung off Andy's pillow and slides, unnoticed, down
the gap between the bed and the back wall.

                         FRIEND #2
            Quick!  Make a space!  This is
            where the spaceship lands.

            -- and you press his back and he
            does a karate-chop action!

            Come on down, guys.  It's time for
            games!  We've got prizes!

                         ANDY
            Oh, yeah!

The kids all run out as fast as they entered, SLAMMING THE
DOOR behind them.

The toys slowly come to life and make their way toward the bed.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            What is it?

                         BO PEEP

                         REX
            Woody?  Who's up there with you?

Woody crawls out from under the bed.  The toys are shocked
to discover him there.

                         SLINKY
            Woody, what are you doing under the
            bed?

                   (composing himself)
            Uh-h-h-h...nothing!  Uh, nothing.
            I'm sure Andy was just a little
            excited, that's all.  Too much cake
            and ice cream, I suppose.  It's
            just a mistake.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in
            your spot, Woody.

                         REX
                   (GASP!)
            Have you been replaced?

                         WOODY
            Hey!  What did I tell you earlier?
            No one is getting replaced.

The toys give each other a look of doubt.

                         WOODY
            Now let's all be polite, and give
            whatever it is up there a nice, big
            "Andy's Room" welcome.

Woody climbs slowly up the side of the bed, peeking over the
edge.  His eyes widen at the sight of...

BUZZ LIGHTYEAR

We see Buzz as Woody does - an expensive looking space age
action figure, covered with buttons and stickers from head
to toe.  The imposing "G.I. Joe-sized" doll stands heroically
in the center of the bed, his back to Woody.

Woody GULPS.

Buzz comes alive and looks around.

ANGLE: BUZZ'S POV THROUGH HIS HELMET

While he scans the bedroom a "DARTH VADER" LIKE BREATHING is
heard.

Buzz eyes it all suspiciously and pushes a button on his chest.

            read me?
                   (to himself)
            Why don't they answer?!!
Just then, Buzz catches sight of his ripped packaging.  The
box is designed to look like a spaceship.

                   (GASP)

He runs up to the box and investigates the damage.

                         BUZZ
            Blast!  This'll take weeks to repair!

Buzz flips open a plastic compartment on his arm -- his
wrist communicator.

            The impact must have awoken me from
            hyper-sleep.

Buzz springs up and down on the squishy surface of the bed.

Woody's face suddenly pops into view.

            Hello-o-o...

                         BUZZ
            HO-YAAAHH!!!

Buzz jumps back, taking a fighting stance.  He presses a
button on his arm that turns on a red "laser beam" light on
his wrist.  Buzz aims the red beam on Woody's forehead and
holds it there.

                         WOODY
            Aaaaaaah!  Whoa, hey, whoa, did I
            frighten you?  Didn't mean to.
            Sorry.  Howdy!  My name is Woody
            and this is Andy's room.  That's
            all I wanted to say, and also,
            there has been a bit of a mix-up.
            This is my spot, see, the bed here --

While Woody is speaking, Buzz notices the sheriff's badge on
Woody's vest.

                         BUZZ
                   (de-activating his
                   laser beam)
            Local law enforcement!  It's about
            time you got here.  I'm Buzz
            Lightyear, Space Ranger, Universe
            Protection Unit.  My ship has crash
            landed here by mistake.

Buzz begins walking around the bed, surveying the situation.
Woody tries to keep up.

                         WOODY
            Yes, it is a mistake, because, you
            see, the bed, here, is my spot.

                         BUZZ
            I need to repair my turbo boosters.
            Do you people still use fossil
            fuels, or have you discovered
            crystalic fusion?

                         WOODY
            Well, let's see, we've got double
            A's --

                         BUZZ
            Watch yourself!!

Buzz shoves Woody down on the bed and re-activates his wrist
laser.

                         BUZZ
                   (continued)
            Halt!  Who goes there?!

The other toys are peeking over the edge of the bed.

                         REX
            Don't shoot!  It's okay!  Friends!

                         BUZZ
                   (to Woody)
            Do you know these life forms?

                         WOODY
            Yes.  They're Andy's toys.

                         BUZZ
            Alright, everyone.  You're clear to
            come up.

Buzz walks over to the toys.

                         BUZZ
            I am Buzz Lightyear.  I come in peace.

Rex steps forward and eagerly shakes Buzz's hand.

                         REX
            Oh, I'm so glad you're not a dinosaur!

                         BUZZ
            Why, thank you...
                   (pulls away)
            Now thank you all for your kind
            welcome.

                         REX
            Say!  What's that button do?

                         BUZZ
            I'll show you.

Buzz presses a button on his chest.

                         BUZZ (SAMPLED VOICE)
            Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

The toys all GASP IN AWE.

                         SLINKY
            Hey, Woody's got something like
            that.  His is a pullstring, only
            it --

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Only it sounds like a car ran over it.

                         HAMM
            Oh yeah, but not like this one.
            This is a quality sound system.
            Probably all copper wiring, huh?
            So, uh, where are you from?
            Singapore?  Hong Kong?

                         BUZZ
            Well...no, actually I'm stationed
            up in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector
            4.  As a member of the elite
            Universe Protection Unit of the
            Space Ranger Corps, I protect the
            galaxy from the threat of invasion
            from the Evil Emperor Zurg, sworn
            enemy of the Galactic Alliance.

As Buzz speaks, Woody glances down at the box in which Buzz
arrived.

ANGLE: BACK OF BUZZ'S BOX

There is a cartoon drawing of Buzz giving the exact, word-
for-word spiel that Buzz is now giving.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Oh, really?  I'm from Playskool.

                         REX
            And I'm from Mattel.  Well, I'm not
            actually  from Mattel, I'm actually
            from a smaller company that was
            purchased in a leveraged buy-out.
            Well, I don't really understand the
            financials, but...

Woody walks over to Bo Peep.

                         WOODY
            You'd think they've never seen a
            new toy before.

                         BO PEEP
            Well sure, look at him.  He's got
            more gadgets on him then a Swiss
            army knife.

Slinky presses the button on Buzz's arm, activating his
laser light.  Buzz quickly pulls his arm away.

                         BUZZ
            Ah, ah, ah, please be careful!  You
            don't want to be in the way when my
            laser goes off.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Hey, a laser!  How come you don't
            have a laser, Woody?

                         WOODY
            It's not a laser!  It's a little
            lightbulb that blinks!

                         HAMM
            What's with him?

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Laser-envy.

                         WOODY
            All right, that's enough.  Look,
            we're all very impressed with
            Andy's new toy --

                         BUZZ
            Toy?

                         WOODY
            T-O-Y.  Toy.

                         BUZZ
            Excuse me, I think the word you're
            searching for is Space Ranger.

                         WOODY
            The word I'm searching for I can't
            say because there's pre-school toys
            present.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?

                         REX
            Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear?  Now I'm
            curious.  What does a Space Ranger
            actually do?

                         WOODY
            He's not a Space Ranger!  He
            doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers
            or fly --

                         BUZZ
            Excuse me.

Buzz calmly hits a button and wings pop out.

Again the toys GASP IN AWE.

                         HAMM
            Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!

                         WOODY
            Oh, what?!...What?!  These are
            plastic.  He can't fly!

                         BUZZ
            They are a terillium-carbonic alloy
            and I CAN fly.

                         WOODY
            No, you can't.

                         BUZZ
            Yes, I can.

                         WOODY
            You can't!

                         BUZZ
            Can!

                         WOODY
            Can't!  Can't!  Can't!

                         BUZZ
            I tell you, I could fly around this
            room with my eyes closed!

                         WOODY
            Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.

                         BUZZ
            All right, then, I will.
                   (to toys)
            Stand back everyone!

The crowd of toys make room for Buzz as he heads towards the
edge of the bed and climbs up the bedpost.  He poses like a
high diver, shuts his eyes...

                         BUZZ
            To infinity and beyond!!

...and leaps off the bed.

Buzz plummets straight down, hits a big rubber ball and
bounces right back up.

He then lands on a Hotwheels car, which races him down the
track, through the loop, and off a ramp.  Buzz soars upward
into a plane mobile hanging from the ceiling.

Buzz becomes wedged between the plane's wheels.  The impact
turns on the PLANE'S MOTOR making it (and Buzz) spin around
and around.

All the other toys watch from the bed, mesmerized.

Finally the centrifugal force causes Buzz to separate from
the plane, sailing him across the room toward the bed.

Buzz makes a perfect landing right in front of Woody and
then opens his eyes.

                         BUZZ
            Can.

The crowd of toys rush Buzz, CHEERING AND CLAPPING WITH
ADORATION.

                         REX
            Whoa!  Oh, wow!  You flew
            magnificently!

                         BO PEEP
            I found my moving buddy!

                         BUZZ
            Why, thank you.  Thank you all.
            Thank you.

                         WOODY
            That wasn't flying!  That was
            falling with style!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Man, the dolls must really go for
            you!
                   (aside)
            Can you teach me that?

Woody stands alone at the other end of the bed, fuming.
Slinky, caught up in the euphoria, approaches Woody.

                         SLINKY
            Heh, heh, heh!  Golly bob howdy --

                         WOODY
            Oh, shut up!  In a couple of days,
            everything will be just the way it
            was.  They'll see... they'll see.
            I'm still Andy's favorite toy.

MONTAGE

SONG: STRANGE THINGS plays over montage.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - LATER

A) Andy plays with Woody: jumping up and down on the bed,
running around the room.

B) Andy sets Woody down on the floor.  Next he "lands" Buzz
Lightyear on the floor opposite Woody.  Andy shoots Buzz's
laser at Woody and then smacks Woody across the room as if
he'd been blown away by the laser.

C) Andy runs into his closet wearing his cowboy hat and
cowboy pajamas.

                                            MATCH CUT TO:

Andy runs out of the closet clad in Buzz Lightyear pajamas
and a homemade spaceman's helmet.

                         ANDY
            Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.

D) Woody observes all the cowboy-themed items in the bedroom
transform to space motif: the posters, the drawings on the
wall, the pillow, the bedspread.

E) Buzz watches Rex execute a WIMPY ROAR.  The space ranger
suggests a few tips for the dinosaur.  Rex tries again, this
time giving a "JURASSIC PARK" ROAR.

The roar blasts Potato Head's features right off his face.

F) Woody passes Etch-A-Sketch, who's sporting a portrait of
Buzz.

Woody looks across the room to see Buzz combing Troll Doll's
hair, chatting away like a hair dresser.

Woody angrily shakes Etch, removing Buzz's image.

G) Rocky, Snake, Troll Doll and Rex are lifting Tinkertoys
as weights.  Buzz works out on top of an upside down Robot,
using his feet as a treadmill.

Potato Head attempts to lift his Tinkertoy barbell but ends
up tumbling backwards, leaving his arms connected to the
barbell.

H) Woody looks under the bed for Slinky, finding only the
checkerboard.

Woody peeks around the corner of the bed to see Slinky and
Robot, under Buzz's direction, setting Buzz's "ship" up on
top of ABC blocks for repair.

In frustration, Woody kicks the checkerboard, sending the
pieces flying.  One of the checkers ricochets off the
dresser and boomerangs into Woody's mouth.

I) On Andy's bed, Buzz pets Slinky whose back end is
stretched over to the other side where Woody sits.  Slinky's
wagging tail whacks Woody in the face repeatedly.

Woody shoves Slinky's rear end off the bed, leaving his
front end no choice but to eventually follow.

J) At bedtime, Andy loads his toys into the toybox until
just Woody and Buzz are left.  He deliberates as to which
toy to keep and which to toss into the toybox.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Andy is sound asleep, with Buzz tucked under the covers next
to him.

Woody peeks out at them from the toybox and then sadly sinks
back into the box, closing the lid to...

BLACK

END MONTAGE/SONG ENDS

The black screen splits horizontally to become...

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - MORNING - WOODY'S POV OF THE BEDROOM
FROM THE TOY BOX

All is clear -- no sign of Andy.  Woody throws open the lid
of the toy box.

                         WOODY
            Finally!

He takes a couple DEEP BREATHS of fresh air, then discovers
that his hat is missing.

                         WOODY
                   (looking back into
                   the toy box)
            Hey!  Who's got my hat?

The rubber shark pops up wearing Woody's cowboy hat.

                         SHARK
            Look, I'm Woody.  Howdy, howdy, howdy!

                         WOODY
                   (sarcastic)
            Ah-hah!  Ah-hah-hah!
                   (grabs the hat)
            Give me that!

Woody leaps out of the toy box.

                         BUZZ (O.S.)
            Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog.
            Let me show you something.  It
            looks as though I've been accepted
            into your culture.

Woody looks up to see Buzz chatting with Rex and Slinky.

                         BUZZ
                   (continued)
            Your Chief, Andy, inscribed his
            name on me.

Buzz puts his foot out so that Slinky and Rex can see the
sole of his boot.

The name "ANDY" is written on it in permanent marker.

                         SLINKY & REX
            Wow!

                         REX
            With permanent ink, too!

                         BUZZ
            Well, I must get back to repairing
            my ship.

Buzz walks away.

Woody looks at HIS foot -- "Andy" is written on it also but
in a much more childish scrawl, and is largely faded.

                         BO PEEP (O.S.)
            Don't let it get to you, Woody.

Hearing Bo, Woody puts his foot back down and quickly
straightens up.

                         WOODY
                   (nonchalant)
            Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what
            do you mean?  Who?

                         BO PEEP
            I know Andy's excited about Buzz,
            but you know, he'll always have a
            special place for you.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
                   (walking past)
            Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...

                         WOODY
            Alright!  That's it!

Woody angrily marches across the room.

Across the room, Buzz's cardboard ship is still up on the
ABC blocks.  Buzz lies down on a skateboard and slides under
the ship like a mechanic.  Snake and Robot stand by waiting
for instructions.  Buzz's hand reaches out from under the ship.

                         BUZZ
            Unidirectional bonding strip.

Robot turns towards Snake who stands in readiness by a tape
dispenser.

                         ROBOT
            Mr. Lightyear wants more tape!

Snake rips off a piece of tape with his mouth.

Woody approaches the skateboard, grabs hold of Buzz's foot
and rolls him out from under the ship.

                         WOODY
            Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away
            from Andy.  He's mine, and no one
            is taking him away from me.

                         BUZZ
            What are you talking about?
                   (to Robot)
            Where's that bonding strip?!

Buzz rolls himself back under.  Woody rolls him out again.

                         WOODY
            And another thing.  Stop with this
            spaceman thing.  It's getting on my
            nerves.

                         BUZZ
            Are you saying you want to lodge a
            complaint with Star Command?
                         WOODY
            Oh okay, so you want to do it the
            hard way, huh?

Buzz stands up, face to face with Woody.

                         BUZZ
            Don't even think about it, cowboy!

                         WOODY
            Oh, yeah, tough guy?!

Woody pushes Buzz in the chest, accidentally activating a
button that makes the spaceman's helmet open.

Buzz grabs his neck, GASPING FOR AIR.  He drops to his knees
and begins to writhe on the ground, holding his breath.

Woody is unsure how to react.

Suddenly, Buzz SNIFFS the air.

                         BUZZ
            The air isn't toxic.

Buzz rises and points an accusing finger at Woody.

                         BUZZ
            How dare you open a spaceman's
            helmet on an uncharted planet!  My
            eyeballs could've been sucked from
            their sockets!

Buzz closes his helmet.

                         WOODY
            You actually think you're THE "Buzz
            Lightyear?" Oh, all this time I
            thought it was an act!
                   (to the room)
            Hey, guys!  Look!  It's the REAL
            Buzz Lightyear!

                         BUZZ
            You're mocking me, aren't you?

                         WOODY
            Oh, no, no, no...
                   (pointing behind Buzz)
            Buzz, look!  An alien!

                         BUZZ
            Where?

Buzz falls for the trick and turns around.

Woody kneels over with LAUGHTER.

SFX: DOG BARKING

Woody stops short.  All the toys look to the bedroom window.

                         SID (O.S.)
            Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...

                         WOODY
            Uh-oh.

Slinky hides under the bed.

                         SLINKY
            It's Sid!

                         REX
            I thought he was at summer camp!

                         HAMM
            They must have kicked him out early
            this year.

The toys rush over to the window.

                         REX
            Oh, no!  Not Sid!

                         SID (O.S.)
            ...Incoming!

From out the window, SID PHILLIPS, a hyperactive ten-year-
old, and his dog, SCUD, can be roughly made out jumping
around in their backyard.

A tiny figure stands isolated in the center of the yard.
Sid pummels the figure with rocks while Scud strains at his
leash, barking wildly.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Who is it this time?

                         WOODY
            I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?

                         LENNY (O.S.)
            Right here, Woody.

Woody turns to see, LENNY, a pair of wind-up binoculars,
approaching him from the other end of the desk.  Woody picks
Lenny up and looks through him to survey the scene.

                         REX
            Oh, no.  I can't bear to watch one
            of these again!

ANGLE: BINOCULAR VIEW OF SID'S BACKYARD

A full size toy soldier is posed in a running stance in the
center of the backyard.  A huge M-80 is strapped to the
doll's back with masking tape.

                         WOODY
            Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.

                         SID (O.S.)
                   (plays under the next
                   5 lines)
            Just stay where you are, Corporal!
            Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up.
            I know you're tired!  I know your
            leg is cramping, but you can't move.
            Do you hear me?

Buzz breaks through the crowd.

                         BUZZ
            What's going on?

                         WOODY
            Nothing that concerns you spacemen.
            Just us TOYS.

                         BUZZ
            I'd better take a look anyway.

Buzz grabs Lenny from Woody and looks through him.

                         BUZZ
            Why is that soldier strapped to an
            explosive device?

                         WOODY
                   (redirecting Buzz's view)
            That's why.  Sid.

ANGLE: BINOCULAR VIEW OF THE DOG, SCUD

                         BUZZ
            Sure is a hairy fellah.

                         WOODY
            No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!

Again, Woody readjusts Buzz's view.

ANGLE: BINOCULAR VIEW OF SID

He is sporting a skull t-shirt and LAUGHING HIDEOUSLY.

                         WOODY
            THAT is Sid!

                         BUZZ
            You mean that happy child?

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            That ain't no happy child.

                         REX
            He tortures toys -- just for fun.

                         BUZZ
            Well, then we've got to do something!

Buzz steps up onto the window ledge.  The toys GASP IN SHOCK.

                         BO PEEP
            What are you doing?!!  Get down
            from there!

                         BUZZ
            I'm going to go teach that boy a
            lesson.

                         WOODY
            Yeah, sure.  You go ahead.  Melt
            him with your scary laser.

Woody presses Buzz's laser button.  It emits a WIMPY
ELECTRONIC BEEP.  Buzz quickly pulls his arm away.

                         BUZZ
            Be careful with that, it's
            extremely dangerous.

While Woody and Buzz banter, Lenny witnesses Sid lighting
the fuse of the M80.

                         LENNY
            He's lighting it!  He's lighting it!

                         SID (O.S.)
            NO-O-O-O-O!!!  CA-A-A-A-A-ARL!

                         LENNY
            Hit the dirt!

The toys jump away from the window.

SFX: EXPLOSION

Dirt clouds and toy shrapnel rain down along the side of
Andy's house.

                         SID (O.S.)
            Yes!  He's gone!  He's history!

Andy's toys peek over the window sill.

ANGLE: SID'S YARD

A large black scorch mark is all that remains where Combat
Carl once stood.  Sid jumps up and down victoriously while
Scud resumes his BARKING.

                         BUZZ
            I could have stopped him.

                         WOODY
            Buzz, I would love to see you try.
                   (gesturing to Sid's yard)
            'Course I'd love to see you as a
            crater.

Sid CACKLES and dances around the crater.

                         BO PEEP
            The sooner we move the better.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. ANDY'S FRONT YARD - SUNSET

A "FOR SALE" real estate sign stands in the front yard.
Another sign reading "SOLD" hangs from the bottom.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALL/ANDY'S BEDROOM

Mom opens the door to Andy's room and steps in.  The room is
full of packing boxes, most of them half full.  Andy is
playing with Woody and Buzz.

                         ANDY
            To infinity and beyond!

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Oh, all this packing makes me
            hungry.  What would you say to
            dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?

                         ANDY
            Pizza Planet?!  Oh, cool!

Andy throws the two toys on his desk with Buzz landing right
on top of Woody.

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Go wash your hands and I'll get
            Molly ready.

The minute the door is closed Woody comes alive and shoves
Buzz off of him.

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Can I bring some toys?

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            You can bring ONE toy...

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Just one?

Woody perks up with concern.

                         WOODY
                   (to himself)
            One toy?

He glances over his shoulder at Buzz, who is walking away
towards the opposite end of the desk.

Woody picks up a Magic 8 Ball left beside him on the desk.
With his back to Buzz, Woody quietly shakes the 8 ball.

                         WOODY
                   (whispering)
            Will Andy pick me?

He tips the 8 ball over.  The triangular oracle floats up to
the surface.  Its prediction reads: DON'T COUNT ON IT.

                         WOODY
            Don't count on it?!!  Doh-h-h-h!

Woody throws down the 8 ball in disgust.  It rolls across
the desk and falls behind it with a LOUD THUD.

Woody suddenly becomes interested in the back of the desk
and peers down it.

ANGLE: BACK OF THE DESK

The 8 ball is wedged way down near the bottom.  The space is
a black chasm, dark and deep, just big enough to fit...a toy.

Woody looks across the desk at Buzz.

He is HUMMING TO HIMSELF as he forages through Andy's
pen/pencil tray looking for "tools" to repair his ship with.
Right behind Buzz sits

THE RC CAR

It rests on the desktop, pointing in the direction where the
8 ball fell, with the remote laying by its side.

Woody smiles for a beat and then runs in a panic over to Buzz.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!!
            Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness!
            We've got trouble!

                         BUZZ
            Trouble?!
                   (looking around)
            Where?!

                         WOODY
                   (pointing to the back
                   of the desk)
            Down there.  Just down there.  A
            helpless toy...it's...it's trapped,
            Buzz!

                         BUZZ
            Then we've no time to lose!!

Buzz runs over and looks down the back of the desk.

                         BUZZ
            I don't see anything!

Woody picks up the remote for the RC Car and switches it on.
RC's eyes (headlights) open sleepily.

                         WOODY
            Oh, he's there.  Just, just keep
            looking.

Woody hits the "FORWARD" button on the remote and steers the
RC Car straight for Buzz.

                         BUZZ
            What kind of a toy -- ?

Buzz turns to see RC headed straight for him.  He dives out
of the way as the RC Car SMASHES into the base of...

A BULLETIN BOARD

The impact forces pushpins to fly out of the board.  Buzz
ducks as pins land all around him, sticking into the desk
like arrows.

POTATO HEAD

sits on the floor in the midst of a card game with Hamm.

He looks up at the desk and GASPS as the bulletin board
slams down onto...

A GLOBE

knocking it out of its stand.  The globe starts rolling
right at Buzz.

Woody stands frozen in disbelief at the chaos he's created.

Buzz runs along the desk, the globe rolling right behind
him, Indiana Jones style.  Buzz gets stuck "log rolling" on
a pile of pencils, but at the last second jumps out of the
way onto the window ledge.

The globe lumbers past Buzz and strikes a Luxo-style
desklamp.  The arm of the lamp swings all the way around,
barely missing Woody...

...and knocks Buzz out the window.

                         TOYS
            BUZZ!!!!

                         WOODY
            Buzz!!!

Woody looks out the window.  No sign of Buzz.  All the other
toys rush over to the sill.

                         SLINKY
            I don't see him in the driveway!  I
            think he bounced into Sid's yard.

Woody backs away from the COMMOTION, unnoticed.

                         REX
                   (GASP)
            Buzz!

                         RC CAR
                   (electric motor sounds)
            Whirrr!!  Whirrrr-whirrrr!!!

Rex looks over at RC.  The remote control car is bouncing up
and down excitedly.

                         REX
            Hey everyone!  RC's trying to say
            something!

The toys turn from the window to RC.

                         REX
                   (leaning down close
                   to RC)
            What is it, boy?

                         RC CAR
                   (electric motor sounds)
            Whirrr!!! Whirrr!  Whirrrrrr!!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            He's sayin' that this was no accident.

                         TOYS
            Huh?

                         BO PEEP
            What do you mean?

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            I mean Humpty Dumpty was pushed...
                   (pointing at Woody)
            ...by Woody.

                         TOYS
            WHAT?!?

The toys turn to Woody who suddenly realizes how this looks.

                         WOODY
            Wait a minute.  You -- you don't
            think I meant to knock Buzz out the
            window, do you Potato Head?

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you
            back-stabbin' murderer!

                         WOODY
            Now, it was an accident!  Guys,
            c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me

                         SLINKY
            We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?

                         REX
                   (backing away)
            Oh, I don't like confrontations.

The Sargent pops out of the army bucket next to Woody.

                         SARGENT
            Where is your honor, dirtbag?!  You
            are an absolute disgrace!  You
            don't deserve to --

Woody seals the lid back on the bucket.

Potato Head starts closing in on Woody.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Couldn't handle Buzz cuttin' in on
            your playtime, could ya Woody?
            Didn't want to face the fact that
            Buzz just might be Andy's new
            favorite toy, so you got rid of him.
            Well, what if Andy starts playin'
            with me more, Woody, huh?  You
            gonna knock me outta the window, too?

Potato Head has driven Woody back to the very edge of the
desk -- trapped.

                         HAMM
            I don't think we should give him
            the chance.

Suddenly, the lid pops off the bucket of army men.

                         SARGENT
            There he is, men!  Frag him!

The army men yell CHARGE and pounce on Woody, while all the
rest of the toys close in.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Let's string him up by his pull-
            string!

                         HAMM
            I got dibs on his hat!

                         BO PEEP
            Would you boys stop it?!

                         HAMM
            Tackle him!

                         WOODY
            No, no, no, no!  Wait!  Wait I can
            explain everything --

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Andy, c'mon!

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Okay, Mom, be right down.  I've got
            to get Buzz.

                         SARGENT
            Retreat!

The toys all drop Woody and rush back to their places.

Andy enters the room and heads straight for the desk where
Woody is lying.  Andy overlooks Woody and begins searching
around the room.

                         ANDY
            Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            No, I haven't seen him.

Woody painfully watches as Andy searches in vain for Buzz.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD (O.S.)
            Psssst!

Woody looks across the room.

Potato Head and Etch-A-Sketch peek out of a packing box.
Etch-A-Sketch scribbles a hangman's noose while Potato Head
points an accusing finger in Woody's direction.

Woody GULPS.

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Andy!  I'm heading out the door.

                         ANDY
            But Mom, I can't find him!

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Well, honey, just grab some other
            toy!  Now c'mon!

                         ANDY
            Okay...

He grabs Woody and walks out of the room.

EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Andy exits the house dragging Woody as he heads toward the
family van in the driveway.

                         ANDY
            I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I
            left him right there.

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Honey, I'm sure he's around.
            You'll find him.

A BUSH

next to the van begins to rustle.  Hands part the foliage,
revealing Buzz.  He eyes Woody going into the van and does a
slow burn.

The van ENGINE STARTS UP.  Buzz races out of the bush, and
with a mighty leap, grabs the rear fender of the van as it
pulls out of the driveway.

ANGLE: SIDE OF ANDY'S HOUSE

A chain of monkeys falls into view, dangling a considerable
distance above the ground.

EXT. ANDY'S BEDROOM WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

The rest of Andy's toys have regrouped at the window,
supervising the lowering of the "monkey chain."

                         SLINKY
            It's too short!  We need more monkeys!

                         REX
                   (holding up an empty barrel)
            There aren't any more!  That's the
            whole barrel.

Rex throws the barrel down and runs back to the ledge.

                         REX
                   (yelling out window)
            Buzz!  The monkeys aren't working!
            We're formulating another plan!
            Stay calm!
                   (beat)
            Oh, where could he be?

EXT. GAS STATION - LATER

The Davis' family van pulls up to one of the pumps.

INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS

Andy sits in the rear seat with Woody lying next to him.

                         ANDY
            Can I help pump the gas?

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Sure!  I'll even let you drive.

Both Mrs. Davis and Andy exit the van while baby Molly
sleeps up front in her car seat.

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Yeah?!

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Yeah -- when you're sixteen.

                         ANDY (O.S.)
                   (sarcastic)
            Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom.

With Mom and Andy out of range, Woody comes to life.  He
stares out the sun roof, still reeling from everything.

                         WOODY
            Oh, great.  How am I gonna convince
            those guys it was an accident?

Suddenly, Buzz appears over the edge of the sun roof.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!

Buzz jumps down on the back seat to face Woody.  He is furious.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!  You're alive!  This is great!
            Oh, I'm saved!  I'm saved!  Andy'll
            find you here, he'll take us back
            to the room, and then you can tell
            everyone that this was all just a
            big mistake.  Huh?

No response from Buzz.  Just an angry stare.

                         WOODY
                   (weakly)
            Right?  Buddy?

                         BUZZ
            I just want you to know that even
            though you tried to terminate me,
            revenge is not an idea we promote
            on my planet.

                         WOODY
            Oh.  Oh, that's good.

                         BUZZ
                   (getting in Woody's face)
            But we're not on my planet, are we?

                         WOODY
            No.

Buzz lunges for Woody.  The two toys fly off the seat and
out the open side door of the van.

EXT. GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS

Woody and Buzz hit the ground and roll under the van, locked
in mortal combat.

                         WOODY
            Ok!  Come on!  You want a piece of
            me?!

Buzz lands a punch that sends Woody's head spinning around.

Woody lunges with all his might.  He smacks Buzz in the
face, making it SQUEAK with every blow.

Buzz closes his helmet on Woody's hand.

                         WOODY
            Owwwww!!!

Woody pounds on Buzz's chest with his free hand, activating
BUZZ'S SAMPLED VOICE buttons.

SFX: CAR DOOR SLAM

The toys stop fighting.  Before they can react...

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Next stop...

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!

The van drives off.

                         WOODY
                   (GASP)
            Andy?!

Woody starts to run in the direction of the van but it
drives out of sight, leaving Buzz and Woody stranded.

                         WOODY
            Doesn't he realize that I'm not
            there?
                   (beat)
            I'm LOST!  Oh, I'm a lost toy!

Meanwhile, Buzz checks the surroundings.  He flips open his
wrist communicator.

                         BUZZ
            Buzz Lightyear Mission Log.  The
            local Sheriff and I seem to be at a
            huge refueling station of some
            sort --

Woody whips around, his expression changing from panic to
seething anger.  He charges at Buzz.

                         WOODY
            You!

SFX: LOUD TRUCK HORN

Just then the toys are bathed in the headlight beams of a
behemoth tanker truck pulling into the station.

Buzz dives off to the side while Woody collapses right where
he stands on the pavement.  The truck ROARS over him.

A GIGANTIC TIRE

stops just millimeters from Woody's nose.

Petrified, Woody inches away from the tire, moving back
under the truck until he bumps into Buzz.

                         BUZZ

            Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!

                         BUZZ
            Sheriff, this is no time to panic.

                         WOODY
            This is the perfect time to panic!
            I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're
            going to move from their house in
            two days and it's all your fault!!

                         BUZZ
            My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me
            out of the window in the first
            place --

                         WOODY
            Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't
            shown up in your stupid little
            cardboard spaceship and taken away
            everything that was important to
            me --

                         BUZZ
            Don't talk to me about importance.
            Because of YOU the security of this
            entire universe is in jeopardy.

                         WOODY
                   (incredulous)
            WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!

Buzz walk to the edge of the truck tire and points up to the
stars.

                         BUZZ
            Right now, poised at the edge of
            the galaxy, Emperor Zurg has been
            secretly building a weapon with the
            destructive capacity to annihilate
            an entire planet.  I alone have
            information that reveals this
            weapon's only weakness.
                   (pointing at Woody)
            And you, my friend, are responsible
            for delaying my rendez-vous with
            Star Command.

Woody explodes.

                         WOODY
            YOU ARE A TOY!!!  You aren't the
            real Buzz Lightyear, you're an
            action figure!!  You are a child's
            plaything!!!

Beat.

                         BUZZ
            You are a sad strange little man
            and you have my pity.  Farewell.

Buzz walks off.

                         WOODY
            Oh, yeah?  Well, good riddance, ya
            looney!

Woody walks away in the opposite direction.

                         PIZZA DELIVERER (O.S.)
            Hey, Gas Dude!

                         ATTENDANT (O.S.)
            You talkin' to me?

                         PIZZA DELIVERER (O.S.)
            Yeah, man, can you help me?  Do you
            know where Cutting Blvd. is?

                         ATTENDANT (O.S.)
            Just a moment...

Woody looks in the direction of the bell.  His face lights
up at the sight of...

A PIZZA PLANET DELIVERY TRUCK.

                         WOODY
                   (to himself)
            Pizza Planet...Andy!

Woody takes a step forward and then stops.

                         WOODY
            Oh, no!  I can't show my face in
            that room without Buzz.

Woody runs back under the tanker truck.  Buzz is at the far
end of the truck, walking away from Woody.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!  Buzz, come back!

                         BUZZ
                   (continuing to walk away)
            Go away.

Woody looks back at the delivery truck in desperation and
then eyes...

ANGLE: DELIVERY TRUCK ROOF SIGN

Atop the truck is a rocket with the Pizza Planet logo.

                         WOODY
            No, Buzz, you've gotta come back.
            I found a spaceship!

Buzz stops walking away and looks back at Woody.

                         WOODY
            It's a spaceship, Buzz!

EXT. GAS STATION - A FEW MINUTES LATER

The delivery truck's engine has stalled and is off.

                         PIZZA DELIVERER (O.S.)
            C'mon, man, hurry up.  Um, like the
            pizza's are getting cold here.

Woody and Buzz eye the parked delivery truck from within the
safety of a nearby oilcan display.

                         BUZZ
            Now you're sure this spacefreighter
            will return to its port of origin
            once it jettisons its food supply?

                         WOODY
            Uh-huh.  And when we get there,
            we'll be able to find a way to
            transport you...home.

                         BUZZ
            Well, then let's climb abroad.

Buzz makes a beeline for the passenger side door of the
pizza truck.  Woody chases after him.

                         WOODY
            No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's
            get in the back.  No one will see
            us there.

                         BUZZ
            Negative.  There are no restraining
            harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll
            be much safer in the cockpit.

In a flash, Buzz has scaled the front tire, grabbed the rear
view mirror, and swung himself up and into the cab.

                         WOODY
                   (loud whisper)
            Yeah, but, Buzz!  Buzz!

                         PIZZA DELIVERER (O.S.)
            Ok, so that's two lefts, and then a
            right, huh?

                         ATTENDANT (O.S.)
            Yeah.

                         PIZZA DELIVERER (O.S.)
            Okay, thanks for the directions.

                         WOODY
                   (loud whisper)
            Buzz!

SFX: ENGINE STARTING

Woody runs around to the back of the truck, scrambles up the
bumper and throws open the back hatch to climb inside.

Woody lets out a YELL, as the back hatch slams back down on
his rear, sending him flying into the bed of the truck.

INT. PIZZA PLANET DELIVERY TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Woody peeks through the dividing window into the cab.

Buzz is hidden from THE PIZZA DRIVER's view by a stack of
pizzas in their insulated covers.  Buzz prudently fastens
his safety belt.

                         WOODY
            It'll be safer in the cockpit than
            the cargo bay.  What an idiot!

The driver shifts into gear and hits the gas, propelling
Woody to the back of the truck.

The pizza deliverer drives like a maniac, taking sharp turns
and hills at high speeds.  Woody is helplessly thrown around
the truck.  With every blow, Woody YELPS in pain.

The truck climbs a steep hill.  Woody looks up just in time
to see...

A LARGE TOOL BOX

barreling towards him.

BAM!!!

                                            CUT TO:

A STAR-FILLED BLACK NIGHT SKY

We MOVE DOWN to reveal...

EXT. PIZZA PLANET - NIGHT

The delivery truck barrels into the parking lot and parks.

INT. DELIVERY TRUCK - CAB - CONTINUOUS

After the driver leaves the truck, Buzz peeks out from the
passenger window.

ANGLE: THE FRONT ENTRANCE

Two imposing animatronic robots guard the doorway.  As
CUSTOMERS approach the front, the guards part their crossed
"pizza spears," allowing the patrons to enter.

                         ROBOT GUARDS
            You are clear to enter.  Welcome to
            Pizza Planet.

VARIOUS ANNOUNCEMENTS blare out from speakers:

Excited, Buzz pries open the window between the cab and
truck bed.

                         BUZZ
            Sheriff!

Woody is gone.  Just the toolbox and strewn trash.

                         BUZZ
                   (continued)
            Sheriff?

The toolbox falls on its side revealing Woody.  He peels off
the back of the truck and falls into a pile of trash.

                         BUZZ
            There you are.  Now the entrance is
            heavily guarded.  We need a way to
            get inside.

Woody rises from the trash with a "MEGA-GULP" cup on his head.

                         BUZZ
            Great idea, Woody!  I like your
            thinking!

EXT. PIZZA PLANET - FRONT ENTRANCE

In the f.g. sits a trashcan with fast food containers
littered around it.  MORE CUSTOMERS approach the "guarded"
entrance.

                         ROBOT GUARDS
            You are clear to enter.  Welcome to
            Pizza Planet.

The front doors automatically swing open as the people pass
through.  Suddenly two pieces of trash -- a burger container
and "MEGA-GULP" cup stand up.

                         BUZZ
                   (in burger container)
            NOW!

The two disguised toys make a dash through the closing doors.

                         BUZZ
                   (in container)
            Quickly, Sheriff!  The airlock is
            closing.

INT. PIZZA PLANET - FRONT ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Woody and Buzz just make it inside but then freeze
immediately as a GROUP OF KIDS run past, forcing the toys to
pose as discarded trash.

Once the coast is clear, Woody and Buzz resume walking.
Buzz bumps into Woody.

                         WOODY
                   (using straw as periscope)
            Ow!  Watch where you're going!

                         BUZZ
                   (mouthing with burger box)
            Sorry.

They sneak in between two long rows of video games and throw
off their disguises.  They then take a good look at...

THE ARCADE

The space-themed arena is filled with hordes of children
playing video games.  A sea of HI-TECH SOUNDS and lights
overwhelm the place.

Buzz is beaming with hope.

                         BUZZ
            What a space port.  Good work, Woody.

Woody is busy looking at all the children in the arcade, but
none of the kids look familiar to him.  Just then he HEARS...

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Mom, can I play Black Hole?
            Please, please, please?!

Woody turns around and through the video games he spots...

ANDY

standing with Mom and Molly in her stroller.

                         WOODY
                   (to himself)
            Andy!

            What's Black Hole?

                         ANDY
            Oh, it's so cool...

The family begins to walk away.

                         BUZZ
            Now we need to find a ship that's
            headed for Sector 12 --

Buzz is about to head off in the opposite direction when
Woody grabs him and quickly pulls him down the video corridor.

                         WOODY
            Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way!
            There's a special ship.  I just saw
            it!

                         BUZZ
            You mean it has hyperdrive?

                         WOODY
            Hyper-active hyperdrive, and
            astro...uh, turf.

The toys manage to get ahead of Andy.  Woody peeks around
the corner of one of the video games and waits for Mom and
Andy to approach.

                         WOODY
                   (tracking Andy and family)
            C'mon, c'mon, that's it...

            Where is it?  I don't see the --

Buzz stops short at the sight of...

A CRANE GAME

It is modeled to look like a spaceship ready to launch.

            Spaceship.

                         WOODY
            Alright Buzz, get ready...

Buzz heads for the crane game, but Woody does not notice,
his eyes locked on the approaching stroller.

                         WOODY
            Okay, Buzz, when I say "go," we're
            gonna jump in the basket --

Woody turns and realizes Buzz is gone.  He looks across the
way just in time to see Buzz leap into the crane game
through the "PRIZE" slot.

                         WOODY
                   (loud whisper)
            Buzz!

Woody turns back in the direction of the stroller.

It has already gone past.

                         WOODY
            Dooh!  No!  This cannot be
            happening to me!!

Woody runs towards the crane game, but is forced to hold
back for a moment as some SCREAMING children pass by.

INT. CRANE GAME

Buzz climbs over the partition that divides the deposit slot
from the prize toys and leaps into a pile of...

SQUEEZE TOY ALIENS

There are hundreds of them, all identical and way too cute.

                         BUZZ
            Greetings!  I am Buzz Lightyear!  I
            come in peace!

                         ALIENS
            Tell us!  What is it like outside?

The squeeze toys rush Buzz like JABBERING excited children.

EXT. CRANE GAME

With the kids gone, Woody crosses the aisle to the crane
game and dives through the prize slot.

INT. CRANE GAME - CONTINUOUS

Woody clambers up the side of the deposit slot.

                         BUZZ (O.S.)
            This is an intergalactic emergency!
            I need to commandeer your vessel to
            Sector 12!

Woody peeks over the partition to witness Buzz surround by
the cute alien toys.

                         BUZZ
                   (continued; to the aliens)
            Who's in charge here?

All the aliens point upward.

                         ALIENS
            The cla-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-w!!

Woody and Buzz look up.

ANGLE: CRANE GAME CLAW

It dangles directly above the toys.

                         ALIEN #1
            The claw is our master.

                         ALIEN #2
            The claw chooses who will go and
            who will stay.

                         WOODY
                   (to himself)
            This is ludicrous.

                         SID (O.S.)
                   (laughter)

Woody GASPS at the recognition of Sid's voice.  He turns to
see Sid heading straight for the crane game.

                         WOODY
            Oh, no!  Sid!!!

Woody leaps off the partition and tackles Buzz, pushing the
two of them deep into the pile of aliens.

                         WOODY
            Get down!!

Sid approaches the crane game and fishes quarters out of his
pants pocket.

                         BUZZ
                   (loud whisper)
            What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I
            was --

                         WOODY
                   (loud whisper)
            YOU are the one that decided to
            climb into this --

                         ALIEN #4
                   (loud whisper)
            Sh-h-h-h-h-h.  The claw.  It moves.

ANGLE: CLAW

It moves into position and hovers directly above the area
where Woody and Buzz are hiding.

The crane drops and grabs hold of the alien toy that is
right on top of Buzz.

                         ALIEN #3
                   (whispering excitedly)
            I have been chosen!!

Positioned with his back to Sid, the alien is lifted up by
the claw.

                         ALIEN #3
                   (continued)
            Farewell, my friends!  I go on to a
            better place.

                         SID
            Gotcha!

With the alien gone, Buzz's upper torso becomes exposed,
forcing the space ranger to freeze.  Sid suddenly spots Buzz.

                         SID
            A Buzz Lightyear!  No way!

Woody, still hidden, frantically looks around for some way
to escape.  Behind him, through the aliens, he eyes...

A SMALL REPAIR DOOR

Woody swims through the alien squeeze toys toward the door.
He grabs hold of the locking latch and, after a few
attempts, is able to pry the door open.

The shadow of the crane lines up over Buzz, lowers, and
grabs his head.

                         SID
            Yes!

The claw begins to lift Buzz up.

                         WOODY
                   (GASP)
            Buzz, NO!

Woody grabs hold of Buzz's feet.

Woody and the claw begin to have a tug-of-war with Buzz.

Woody pulls down hard, forcing Buzz to sink into the pile of
aliens, out of Sid's view.

                         SID
                   (slamming his fist
                   against the glass)
            Wha -- ?  Hey!!

Still tugging against the crane, Woody is almost out the
door with Buzz.  Just then, the aliens at the bottom of the
pile pull Buzz and Woody back inside.

                         ALIEN #4
            He has been chosen.

                         WOODY
            Hey!  What are you doing?

                         ALIEN #5
            He must go.

                         WOODY
            Stop it, you -- !  Stop it, you
            zealots!

                         ALIENS
            He must go!  Do not fight the claw!
            Do not anger the claw!  He has been
            chosen.

Woody and Buzz are pushed up to the surface and into the
air, dangling lifelessly in front of Sid.

                         SID
            Alright!  Double prizes!

Woody and Buzz are dropped into the prize door slot and
snatched up by Sid.

                         SID
                   (looking at his two
                   new toys)
            Let's go home and...play.  Ha-ha-ha.

EXT. SID'S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

From out of the darkness appears Sid on his skateboard.  He
is HUMMING to rock music from his walkman while carrying his
backpack in his hand.

Sid leaps off the skateboard and walks up the front path
towards the front door.

Through the open zipper, Buzz peeks out of the backpack to
see Sid's house.  He recognizes Andy's house next door.

INT. BACKPACK - CONTINUOUS

Buzz, Woody and a squeeze toy alien are scrunched up in the
backpack.

                         BUZZ
            Sheriff!  I can see your dwelling
            from here!  You're almost home.

                         ALIEN
            Nirvana is coming!  The mystic
            portal awaits!

                         WOODY
                   (to Alien)
            Will you be quiet?!!
                   (to both)
            You guys don't get it, do you?
            Once we go into Sid's house, we
            won't be coming out.

ANGLE: TOYS' POV FROM OUT BACKPACK

The front door opens to reveal Scud.  The dog lunges
straight for the backpack, BARKING.

                         SID
            Whoa, Scud!  Hey, boy.  Sit!  Good
            boy!

The dog begrudgingly obeys.

                         SID
            Hey, I got somethin' for ya, boy.

Sid's hand reaches into the backpack.

                         WOODY
                   (loud whisper)
            FREEZE!!!

The toys go still.  Sid's hand grabs the alien out of the
backpack.  The alien is then placed sideways along Scud's
snout.

                         SID
            Ready, set, NOW.

In one quick motion, Scud flips the alien up, catches it in
his mouth, and rabidly shakes it back and forth.

Buzz and Woody react in horror.

                         SID
            Hannah!  Hey, Hannah!!!

Woody and Buzz glance up to see HANNAH, Sid's frail little
sister, carrying her Janie Doll.

                         HANNAH
            What?

                         SID
            Did I get my package in the mail?

                         HANNAH
            I dunno.

                         SID
            Whaddaya mean, you don't know?

                         HANNAH
                   (insistent)
            I don't know!

                         SID
                   (mock concern)
            Oh no, Hannah!

                         HANNAH
            What?

                         SID
            Look!  Janie!

He grabs the doll.

                         HANNAH
            Hey!!

                         SID
            She's sick!

                         HANNAH
                   (panic rising)
            No she's NOT --

                         SID
            I'll have to perform one of
            my...operations!

                         HANNAH
            NO-O-O... Don't touch her!  NO!

Sid bolts upstairs with Hannah in pursuit.

                         WOODY
            Not Sid's room...not there...

INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - CONTINUOUS

Sid races to his bedroom door.  Hannah is right behind.

                         HANNAH
            Sid!  Give her back!

Sid just LAUGHS.  He charges into the room and slams the
door in his sister's face.

INT. SID'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                         HANNAH (O.S.)
                   (pounding on his door)
            Sid!  Sid!...

Sid carelessly tosses the backpack on the bed and walks over
to a makeshift workbench.

                         SID
                   (as Doctor)
            Oh, no.  We have a sick patient
            here, nurse.  Prepare the O.R., STAT!

Sid CLICKS on a bare bulb dangling above his "operating
table."

Woody and Buzz look on from the safety of the backpack as
Sid places the Janie doll's head in a vise.

                         HANNAH (O.S.)
            Sid, give her back!  Give her back
            now!  I'm telling!

                         SID
                   (as Doctor)
            Patient is...
                   (straining while
                   tightening vise)
            ...pre-e-epped.

Sid grabs a painter's mask from his toolchest and dons it
like a surgeon's mask.

                         SID
                   (as Doctor)
            No one's ever attempted a double
            bypass brain transplant before.

Sid grabs a toy pterodactyl from a nearby crate full of junk.

                         SID
                   (as Doctor)
            Now for the tricky part -- pliers!

                         BUZZ
                   (whispering to Woody)
            I don't believe that man's ever
            been to medical school.

Sid struggles for a moment with his "patient" then stops.

                         SID
                   (as Nurse)
            Doctor, you've done it!
                   (running to the door)
            Hannah?

He opens the door.  Hannah is standing there, looking worried.

                         SID
                   (continued)
            Janie's all better now.

He hands her Janie -- her head has been replaced with a
pterodactyl's.  Hannah SCREAMS at the sight of the
monstrosity and bolts down the hallway.

                         HANNAH
            MOM!!  MOM!!

                         SID
            She's lying!  Whatever she says
            it's not true!

Sid throws the doll to the ground and runs after Hannah,
slamming the door behind him.

Woody and Buzz peer out of the backpack at their new
surroundings.  Heavy metal posters, discarded toy remains
and power tools adorn the messy room.

They are in Hell...toy Hell.

                         WOODY
            We are gonna die.
                   (bolting out of the pack)
            I'm outta here!

Woody leaps from the bed to the doorknob and struggles to
open it.  No good.  Woody drops to the floor.

                         WOODY
            Locked!  There's gotta be another
            way out of here.

SFX: ROLLING SOUND

Woody is startled by the noise.

A small yo-yo rolls out from behind a box and falls on its
side.

Spooked, Woody grabs a pencil from the floor and brandishes
it like a weapon.

Just then a shadow passes by Woody.  He turns quickly but
sees nothing.

                         WOODY
            Uh...Buzz?  Was that you?

Woody hurriedly trades his pencil for a larger flashlight.

He hears a NOISE from under Sid's bed.  Woody turns on the
flashlight and shines the beam in the direction of the
noise, illuminating...

A BABY DOLL HEAD'S PROFILE

                         WOODY
            Hey!  Hi, there, little fellah!
            Come out here.  Do you know a way
            out of here?

The baby doll moves out from under the bed, revealing a one-
eyed doll head atop a spider-like body made of erector set
pieces.

                         WOODY
                   (GASP!!)

The creature extends its legs and rises up taller than Woody.
Scared speechless, Woody keeps his flashlight beam locked on
BABYFACE.

Various other MUTANT TOYS begin to emerge from the shadows:
a toy fishing pole with fashion doll legs, a skateboard with
a combat soldier's torso screwed to the front end, a jack-
in-the-box with a rubber hand for a head, (and others).

Woody leaps onto the bed and hides behind Buzz.

                         WOODY
            B-B-B-Buzz!

Buzz and Woody look on as the mutants have a tug of war as
they grab all the Janie and pterodactyl parts, dragging them
off into the shadows.

                         BUZZ
            They're cannibals!

Woody retreats back into the backpack.

INT. BACKPACK - CONTINUOUS

Woody cowers in the corner as Buzz enters.  He punches a
button on his chest.

                         BUZZ
            May day!  May day!  Come in, Star
            Command!  Send reinforcements!...
                   (pause)
            Star Command, do you copy?

No response.

Buzz adjusts his laser light.  It emits a short BLIP.

                         BUZZ
                   (aiming his arm out
                   the pack)
            I've set my laser from stun to kill.

                         WOODY
            Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if
            anyone attacks us we can blink 'em
            to death.

EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Rex points a flashlight out of Andy's bedroom window while
Bo Peep, Slinky, Hamm and Potato Head look on.

Some bushes rustle below.

                         REX
            Hey, you guys!  I think I've found
            him.  Buzz!  Is that you?!

Rex points the flashlight beam at the shaking bushes.  The
annoyed MEOW of a cat is heard.

                         REX
            Whiskers!  Will you get out of
            here?!  You're interfering with the
            search and rescue.

SFX: APPROACHING CAR

Rex turns off the flashlight.

                         REX
                   (whispering)
            Look!  They're home!

The toys duck behind the sill.

The Davis' family van pulls into the driveway.  Andy and Mrs.
Davis get out.

                         ANDY
            Mom, have you seen Woody?

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Where was the last place you left him?

                         ANDY
                   (searching the van)
            Right here in the van.

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're
            just not looking hard enough.

                         ANDY
            He's not here, Mom.  Woody's gone.

The toys all look at one another.

                         BO PEEP
                   (GASP)
            Woody's gone?!

                         HAMM
            Well waddah-ya-know, the weasel ran
            away.

Hamm, Potato Head and Rex walk away from the window.
                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was
            guilty.

                         REX
            Who would've thought he was capable
            of such atrocities?!

Bo Peep and Slinky are left alone at the window, visibly
crestfallen.

                         BO PEEP
            Oh, Slink, I hope he's okay.

SFX: HAND SLAP

INT. SID'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

An inanimate Woody flies across the room, landing hard on
the floor.

Sid crosses to the window.

                         SID
                   (as Interrogator)
            I can see your will is strong.

Sid opens the window shade.  Bright sunlight shines down
onto Woody.

                         SID
                   (continued)
            Well, we have ways of making you talk.

Sid pulls out a magnifying glass from his back pocket and
focuses the beam on Woody's forehead.

                         SID
                   (as Interrogator)
            Where are your rebel friends now?
            Heh, heh.

A bright white hot dot forms on Woody's forehead and begins
to smolder.

                         SID'S MOM (O.S.)
            Sid!!  Your pop-tarts are ready!

Sid pulls the magnifying glass away.

                         SID
            Alright!!

Sid runs out of the room.  As soon as he's gone, Woody jumps
up SCREAMING, his forehead burning.

He runs to a bowl of half-eaten cereal (with milk) on the
floor, and dunks his head in.

Buzz runs over to Woody, pausing to remove two suction cup
darts from his person before pulling Woody out of the bowl.
Two colorful Froot-Loops stick to each of Woody's eyes like
glasses.

                         BUZZ
            Are you alright?
                   (whacking him on the back)
            I'm proud of you, Sheriff.  A
            lesser man would have talked under
            such torture.

Woody looks at his reflection in the back of the cereal
spoon and rubs the burn mark on his forehead.

                         WOODY
            I sure hope this isn't permanent.

                         BUZZ
                   (checking his wrist communicator)
            Still no word from Star Command.
            We're not that far from the
            spaceport --

Woody's eyes light up.

ANGLE: SPOON

Sid's bedroom door can be seen in the reflection.  It's open.

                         WOODY
            The door!  It's open!  We're free!!

Woody runs for the door.  Buzz follows.

                         BUZZ
            Woody, we don't know what's out there!

                         WOODY
            I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!

THE MUTANT TOYS

suddenly appear and block their path to the doorway.  Woody
hides behind Buzz.

                         WOODY
            They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!  Do
            something!  Quick!

                         BUZZ
            Shield your eyes!

Buzz fires his laser at them.  The little red beam just
flickers against Babyface's head.  The mutant toys look
confusedly at each other.

                         BUZZ
            It's not working.  I recharged it
            before I left.  It should be good
            for hours --

                         WOODY
            Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use
            your karate chop action!

Grabbing Buzz like a hostage, Woody fends off the mutant
toys by pushing a large button on Buzz's back, making Buzz's
arm involuntarily "chop" up and down.

                         WOODY
                   (to mutants)
            Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!

                         BUZZ
            Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that?
            Stop that!

                         WOODY
            Back!  Back, you savages!  Back!

Woody circles around the mutant toys to the open doorway,
continually chopping Buzz's arm.

                         BUZZ
            Woody, stop it!!

                         WOODY
            Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!

Woody drops Buzz and runs out the door.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Woody races down the corridor...

                         WOODY
                   (to himself)
            There's no place like home.
            There's no place like home.
            There's no place like home...

...turns onto the top of the stairwell, down a few steps,
and is confronted by...

SCUD

asleep on the landing.

Woody freezes inches away from the sleeping beast.  He
slowly backs up the stairs.

Suddenly Buzz appears and pulls Woody back against the
hallway wall.  He covers Woody's mouth with his hand.

                         WOODY
                   (muffled gasp)


                         BUZZ
                   (whisper)
            Another stunt like that, cowboy --
            you're going to get us killed.

                         WOODY
                   (pulling Buzz's hand away)
            Don't tell me what to do!

                         BUZZ
            Shhh!

Buzz checks to make sure Scud is still asleep and then darts
across the stairwell opening to the other end of the hallway.
Once safely across, he motions for Woody to follow.

Woody cowardly crawls on all fours across the open area and
meets up with Buzz.

As he stands...

WOODY'S PULLSTRING RING

gets caught on one of the curls of the wrought iron railing.

The toys begin to creep down the hallway, unaware that
Woody's pullstring is being pulled farther and farther
until --

It SNAPS off the iron railing and flies back towards Woody.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            YEEEEEEE-HAAAAAAA!!

Both Buzz and Woody leap in surprise at the sound of Woody's
voice box.

ANGLE: SCUD'S EYE

It opens.

Woody vainly attempts to stifle the recoiling pullstring.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
                   (continued)
            Giddy-up partner!...

GROWLING, Scud starts up the stairs.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
                   (continued)
            ...We got to get this wagon train a
            movin'!

Woody and Buzz take off running.

                         BUZZ
            Split up!

Two doors are ajar at the other end of the hallway.  Buzz
dives behind one while Woody jumps into...

A CLOSET

Woody slams the door shut just as Scud reaches the top of
the landing.  CRASHED can be heard from behind the closet
door, getting Scud's attention.

Buzz peeks out from his doorway at Scud SNIFFING AND
GROWLING at the closet.

Sensing movement behind him, Scud whips around and starts to
enter Buzz's doorway.

SFX: SNORING

The noise stops the dog in his tracks.  Both Scud and Buzz
look up to see...

INT. SID'S DAD'S DEN - CONTINUOUS

MR. PHILLIPS is asleep on a La-Z-Boy recliner in front of
the T.V.

Scud backs out and heads down the stairs.

Buzz turns to exit the room when he hears...

                         SPACE COMMANDER (O.S.; ON TV)
            Calling Buzz Lightyear!!  Come in
            Buzz Lightyear!!  This is Star
            Command.  Buzz Lightyear!  Do you
            read me?!

                         BUZZ
            Star Command!

Buzz opens up his wrist communicator and is just about to
speak into it when he is interrupted.

                         KID #1 (O.S.)
            Buzz Lightyear responding!  Read
            you loud and clear!

Buzz turns around to see...

A TELEVISION SET

Buzz's space ranger logo is on the screen over a field of
stars.  The image quickly changes to two young boys playing
in their backyard with a Buzz Lightyear doll.

                         SPACE COMMANDER
            Buzz Lightyear, Planet Earth needs
            your help!

                         KID #1
                   (into toy wrist communicator)
            On the way!

                         MALE CHORUS (V.O.)
            BUZZ LIGHTYEAR!!!

Buzz reacts with confusion at what he is watching.  He walks
slowly towards the television set.

                         TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
            The world's greatest superhero!
            Now the world's greatest TOY!

ANGLE: TV COMMERCIAL

The Buzz Lightyear doll is now out of the box and being
displayed.

                         TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
            Buzz has it all!  Locking wrist
            communicator!

                         KID #1
            Calling Buzz Lightyear.

                         TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
            Karate chop action!

                         KID #2
            Wow!

With every feature demonstrated on the TV, Buzz compares the
same feature on himself.

                         TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
            Pulsating laserlight!

                         KID #2
            Total annihilation!

                         TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

                         TV BUZZ (SAMPLED VOICE)
            It's a secret mission in uncharted
            space!

Buzz presses the same button on his uniform.

                         BUZZ (SAMPLED VOICE)
            It's a secret mission in uncharted
            space!

                         TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
            And best of all...
                   (big "monster truck" voice)
            HIGH-PRESSURE-SPACE-WINGS!!

                         TV BUZZ
            To Infinity and Beyond!

On the TV screen, the Buzz Lightyear action figure appears
to be launched through the air.  The words:  NOT A FLYING
TOY flash across the bottom of the screen.

                         TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                   (non-excited lawyer voice)
            Not a flying toy.

Buzz slowly shakes his head in wide-eyed disbelief.

                         TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
            Get your Buzz Lightyear action
            figure and save a galaxy near you!

                         MALE CHORUS (V.O.)
            BUZZ LIGHTYEAR!!!

The image on the screen changes to a shot of hundreds of
Buzzes in their boxes lining either side of a store aisle.

                         LOCAL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
            Available at all Al's Toy Barn
            outlets in the tri-county area.

Buzz is stricken.  He looks down at his wrist communicator
and opens it.

ANGLE: WRIST COMMUNICATOR

Molded on the underside of the cover are three words: "MADE
IN TAIWAN."

SONG: "I WILL GO SAILING NO MORE" BEGINS

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Buzz walks dejectedly out of the den and down the hallway.

As he passes the top of the stairwell he pauses to look up
through the railing at...

A SMALL WINDOW

It is open, revealing the blue sky beyond.  A bird flies past.

The taunting voice of Woody echoes in his head.

                         WOODY (V.O.)
            You are a toy!  You can't fly!

Buzz bows his head, defeated.

BEAT

Slowly Buzz raises his head, determination in his eyes.  He
slams the offending wrist communicator shut, as if to deny
its message of "Made in Taiwan."

Buzz climbs up the railing to the banister.  He pops open
his wings, and aims himself towards the window above.

                         BUZZ
            To Infinity and Beyond!

Buzz leaps off the banister...

and falls.

In SLOW MOTION Buzz watches his square of blue sky pull
farther away from him as he plummets to the floor below.

INT. SID'S HOUSE/ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS

Buzz CRASHES on the entryway floor.

Buzz opens his eyes to see...

HIS SEVERED LEFT ARM

The broken arm lies a few inches away from his now empty arm
socket.

Buzz drops his head back in defeat.

SONG ENDS

                         HANNAH (O.S.)
            M-o-o-om?  Mom, have you seen my
            Sally doll?

Hannah walks into the entryway, and not seeing Buzz, steps
on him.

                         MOM (O.S.)
            What, dear?  What was that?

Hannah picks up Buzz (and his arm) and smiles.

                         HANNAH
            Nevermind.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - LATER

ANGLE: CLOSET

The knob jiggles for a moment.  Suddenly, the door flies
open revealing Woody, entangled in Christmas lights,
standing atop a pile of boxes to be at doorknob height.

Woody and the rest of the junk topple over.

A bowling ball topples out, smashing Woody square on the head.

                         WOODY
            Oo-o-of!
                   (to the hallway)
            Buzz?!  The coast is clear.  Buzz?
            Where are you?
                         BUZZ (O.S.; SAMPLED VOICE)
            It's a secret mission in uncharted
            space!  Let's go!!

Woody creeps down the hallway, dragging the Christmas lights
with him.

                         HANNAH (O.S.)
            Really?  That is so-o-o interesting.

Woody peeks into the open doorway of...

INT. HANNAH'S BEDROOM/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Hannah is pretending to have a tea party.  Her guests are
dolls, headless dolls, that is except for...

BUZZ

He is seated at the miniature table, dressed up in a frilly
apron and fashionable party hat.

                         HANNAH
                   (continued)
            Would you like some tea, Mrs. Nesbit?

                         WOODY
                   (under his breath)
            Buzz!

Hannah has placed a tiny teapot in Buzz's severed arm and
pours imaginary tea with it.

                         HANNAH
            It's so nice you could join us on
            such late notice.

Woody steps back into the hallway.

                         WOODY
            Oh, no!

                         HANNAH
            What a lovely hat, Mrs. Nesbit.  It
            goes quite well with your head.

Woody thinks for a moment, then takes a few steps further
down the hall.  He CLEARS HIS THROAT.

                         WOODY
                   (high voice)
            Hannah!  Oh, Hannah!

Hannah stops pouring tea and looks up.

                         HANNAH
                   (yelling out her room)
            Mom?
                   (to the dolls)
            Please excuse me, ladies.  I'll be
            right back.

As soon as Hannah exits the room Buzz keels over face-down
onto the table.

Hannah passes Woody, hidden in the Christmas lights, and
walks downstairs.

                         HANNAH
            What is it, Mom?  Mom, where are you?

Woody bolts into Hannah's room.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!  Hey, Buzz!  Are you okay?

Buzz lifts his head up and wails in drunken despair.

                         BUZZ
            Gone!  It's all go-o-one!  All of
            it's gone.  Bye-bye!  Whoo-hoo!
            See ya!

Woody picks up Buzz's severed arm.

                         WOODY
            What happened to you?

                         BUZZ
            One minute you're defending the
            whole galaxy...
                   (pointing at other dolls)
            ...and suddenly you find yourself
            suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie
            Antoinette and her little sisters.

The headless dolls turn and wave.

Woody removes the teapot from the severed arm and sets it on
the table.

                         WOODY
            I think you've had enough tea for
            today.
                   (helping Buzz up)
            Let's get you out of here, Buzz.

                         BUZZ
                   (grabbing Woody)
            Don't you get it?!  You see the hat?
            I am Mrs. Nesbit!!
                   (hysterical laughter)


                         WOODY
            Snap out of it, Buzz!

Woody presses Buzz's helmet open, slaps him across the face
with his own detached arm, and then politely closes the helmet.

Buzz sobers up and calmly takes his severed arm from Woody.
Buzz walks out of the room while Woody follows.

                         BUZZ
                   (sober)
            I'm sorry.  You're right.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

                         BUZZ
                   (continued)
            ...I'm just a little depressed,
            that's all.  I can get through this.

Buzz reaches the center of the hallway and drops to his knees.

                         BUZZ
            Oh, I'm a sham!!

                         WOODY
                   (loud whisper)
            Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.

                         BUZZ
            Look at me!  I can't even fly out
            of a window!

Woody stops short.  He looks down the hallway in the
direction of Sid's room.

ANGLE: SID'S BEDROOM WINDOW

Woody can see straight out Sid's window across the way to
Andy's bedroom window.

                         BUZZ
                   (continued)
            But -- the hat looked good.  Tell
            me the hat looked good!  The apron
            is a bit much, it's not my color...

                         WOODY
            Out the window...Buzz, you're a
            genius!

Woody grabs the coil of Christmas lights and drags Buzz
towards Sid's room.

                         WOODY
                   (continued)
            Come on, this way!

                         BUZZ
            Years of Academy training...wasted!!

EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE/ANDY'S BEDROOM WINDOW

Mr. Potato Head and Hamm are playing Battleship.  Hamm's
wearing Potato Head's hat.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            B-3.

                         HAMM
            Miss.  G-6.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Ohhh!  You sunk it!

                         HAMM
            Heh-heh.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Are you peeking?

                         HAMM
            Oh, quit your whining and pay up.

Potato Head reaches for his ear.

                         HAMM
            No, no, not the ear.  Gimme the
            nose.  C'mon!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
                   (pulling out his
                   nose; nasally)
            How 'bout three out of five?

He is about to hand his nose over to Hamm when...

                         WOODY (O.S.)
            Hey guys!  Guys!  Hey!

Both toys look across the way.

EXT. SID'S WINDOW/ANDY'S BEDROOM WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

Woody has just finished lifting Sid's window and waves to
the toys.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Son of a building block, it's Woody!

                         HAMM
            He's in the psycho's bedroom!

                         WOODY
            Hi!

                         HAMM
                   (into Andy's bedroom)
            Everyone, it's Woody!

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Slinky, Bo Peep and Rex look to the window.

                         BO PEEP
            Woody?!

                         REX
            You're kidding?

                         SLINKY
            Woody?!

INT. SID'S ROOM

                         WOODY
            We're gonna get outta here, Buzz --
            Buzz?

Buzz is not there.  Woody looks down at the floor.

Buzz is sitting on the floor, playing "bombs away" with his
broken arm.

EXT. ANDY'S BEDROOM WINDOW/SID'S WINDOW

The rest of Andy's toys gather around the window to see Woody.

                         REX
            Hey, look!

                         BO PEEP
            Woody!

                         WOODY
            Boy, am I glad to see you guys!

                         SLINKY
            I knew you'd come back, Woody!

                         BO PEEP
            What are you doing over there?

                         WOODY
            It's a long story, Bo.  I'll
            explain later.  Here, catch this!

Woody tosses one end of the Christmas lights over.  Slinky
catches them.

                         SLINKY
            I got it, Woody!

                         REX
                   (overly excited)
            He got it, Woody!

                         WOODY
            Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just
            tie it on to something!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea!
            How about we DON'T?!

Potato Head grabs the string of lights away from Slinky.

                         SLINKY
            Hey?!!

                         BO PEEP
            Potato Head!?

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Did you all take stupid pills this
            morning?!  Have you forgotten what
            he did to Buzz?  And now you want
            to let him back over here?

                         WOODY
            No, no, no!  You got it all wrong,
            Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz
            is right here.  He's with me!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            You are a liar!

                         WOODY
            No, I'm not!
                   (to Buzz)
            Buzz, come over here and you just
            tell the nice toys that you're not
            dead.

ANGLE: BUZZ

He doesn't respond, preoccupied with peeling off the sticker
on his wrist communicator.  He crumples it up and tosses it
aside.

                         WOODY
                   (to Andy's toys)
            Just a sec.

INT. SID'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Frantic, Woody walks over to the edge of the desk.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!  Will you get up here and
            give me a hand?!

Buzz's severed arm comes flying into view and lands by
Woody's feet.

                         WOODY
                   (insincerely)
            Ha ha.  That's very funny, Buzz.
                   (exploding)
            This is serious!!

                         REX (O.S.)
            Hey, Woody!?  Where'd ya go?

                         MR. POTATO HEAD (O.S.)
            He's lyin'.  Buzz ain't there.

EXT. SID'S WINDOW/ANDY'S WINDOW

Woody reappears at the edge of Sid's window.  He pretends to
notice something out of the other toy's view.

                         WOODY
                   (forced casualness)
            Oh, hi Buzz!  Why don't you say
            "hello" to the guys over there?

BUZZ'S SEVERED ARM

suddenly appears with Woody holding the end just out of
sight.  Woody throws his voice, pretending to be Buzz.

                         WOODY (AS BUZZ)
            Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and
            beyond!

                         REX
            Hey look!  It's Buzz!

                         WOODY
                   (shaking the arm's hand)
            Yeah, hey Buzz.  Let's show the
            guys our new secret best-friends
            hand shake.  Gimme five, man!

                         HAMM
            Something's screwy here.

                         WOODY
            So, you see?  We're friends now,
            guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?
                   (as BUZZ)
            You bet.  Gimme a hug.

Woody makes Buzz's arm grab his neck and pull him forward.

                         WOODY
                   (continued; as himself)
            Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.

                         SLINKY
            See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back
            the lights, Potato Head.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Wait just a minute.  What are you
            trying to pull?!

                         WOODY
            Nothing.

Woody innocently shrugs and throws both his hands up...

...exposing the severed arm.

The toys all SCREAM in horror.  Rex clasps his hands to his
mouth and turns away to BARF.

Realizing his mistake, Woody tries to hide the arm, but it's
too late.

                         HAMM
            Oh, that is disgusting.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Murderer!

                         WOODY
            No!  No, no, no, no!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            You murdering dog!

                         WOODY
            No, it's not what you think, I swear!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Save it for the jury.  I hope Sid
            pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!

Potato Head drops the lights.

                         WOODY
            No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave!
            You've gotta help us, please!  You
            don't know what it's like over here!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
                   (to the other toys)
            Come on.  Let's get out of here.

                         HAMM
            Go back to your lives, citizens.
            Show's over.

All the toys leave the window except Slinky.

                         WOODY
            Come back!  Slink!  Slink, please!
            Please!  Listen to me!

Unable to look Woody in the eye, Slinky closes the blinds.

                         WOODY
                   (continued)
            No!  No!  Come back!  SLI-I-I-INKYYY!!

SFX: THUNDER

As storm clouds roll over Sid's house, Woody slumps over the
window sill in defeat.

INT. SID'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

BROKEN TOY SOUNDS emit from behind Woody.  He turns from the
window to see...

THE MUTANT TOYS

converging all around Buzz.

                         WOODY
            BUZZ!!

Still holding onto Buzz's arm, Woody jumps down from the
desk and runs to Buzz's rescue.

                         WOODY
            Go away, you disgusting freaks!

Babyface turns from the fray and charges at Woody with his
erector-set pinchers.

Woody cowers, shielding himself from Buzz's arm.

Babyface clamps onto the arm and has a tug-o-war with Woody.

                         WOODY
            Alright back!  Back, you cannibals!

Woody loses his grip on the arm and sails across the room,
crashing into the wall.

By now there is no sight of Buzz within the swarming mass of
mutant toys.

Woody attacks the mob with a vengeance.

                         WOODY
            He is still alive, and you're not
            gonna get him, you monsters!

He furiously throws the mutant toys aside, digging his way
to...

BUZZ

He is sitting up, his broken arm now newly-attached.

Woody's anger turns to confusion.

                         WOODY
            Hey?!  Hey, they fixed you!

Woody shakes Buzz's arm to confirm what he's seeing is real
when he looks to the mutants.

                         WOODY
                   (continued)
            But -- but they're cannibals.  We
            saw them eat those other toys.

The mutant toys part to reveal the recent victims of Sid's
last "operation": The Janie Doll and Pterodactyl.  Their
heads have been taped back on the correct bodies.

The mutants all innocently stare at Woody.

                         WOODY
            Uh...sorry.  I...I thought that you
            were gonna...
                   (laughs nervously)
            ...you know, eat my friend.

Immediately, the mutant toys retreat back into the dark
corners of the room.

                         WOODY
            Hey!  No, no, wait!  Hey!  What's
            wrong?

                         SID'S MOM (O.S.)
            Sid!

                         SID (O.S.)
            Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!

                         WOODY
            Sid!!!

FOOTSTEPS approach the bedroom.  Woody tries to pick up the
still depressed Buzz, but he just goes limp.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!  C'mon, get up!  Buzz,
            you're...
                   (GRUNT)
            ...get up...

Woody begins dragging Buzz towards the bed, but their
progress is too slow.  He shakes Buzz hard.

                         WOODY
            Fine.  Let Sid trash you.  But
            don't blame me.

Woody leaves Buzz sitting alone in the middle of the floor
and hides underneath a nearby milkcrate just as...

Sid enters carrying a big box.

                         SID
            It came!  It finally came!

Sid runs over to his workbench and rips open the box.

                         SID
                   (reverently)
            The big one.

He pulls out a rocket with "THE BIG ONE" written on it.

                         SID
                   (reading the rocket label)
            "Extremely dangerous.  Keep out of
            reach of children."  COOL...
                   (looks around)
            What am I gonna blow?  Man...hey,
            where's that wimpy cowboy doll?

Sid spots the milkcrate and picks it up.

No Woody.

ANGLE: UNDERSIDE OF MILKCRATE

Out of Sid's view, Woody presses against the inside, hanging
on for dear life.

SFX: BUZZ'S LASER

Sid looks down and notices he's stepping on Buzz, activating
his laser.

                         SID
            Yes!  I've always wanted to put a
            spaceman into orbit.  Ha-ha.

He places Buzz and the milkcrate on the workbench and throws
a toolbox on top of the crate.

The impact of the toolbox dislodges Woody from his hiding
place.  Woody quickly ducks under a magazine on the floor of
the crate "jail."

Woody watches helplessly as Sid fishes out a roll of
electrical tape from the toolbox and, with an IRREVERENT
CHUCKLE, tapes Buzz to the rocket.

SFX: THUNDERCLAP

A flash of lightning interrupts the moment.

                         SID
            Oh, no...

Sid crosses to the window to see a huge rainstorm commence.
Sullenly, he smacks his head against the window.

                         SID
            Aw, man...!

Woody heaves a SIGH of relief.

Suddenly Sid's face brightens.  He turns his focus from the
rain to the Buzzrocket.

                         SID
                   (as Newscaster)
            Sid Phillips reporting.  Launch of
            the shuttle has been delayed due to
            adverse weather conditions at the
            launch site.  Tomorrow's forecast...

Sid smacks Buzz down on the desk, winds his alarm clock, and
places it next to Buzz.

                         SID
            Sunny.  Ha-ha-ha.  Sweet dreams.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

Andy is being tucked into bed by his mother.  She hands him
his cowboy hat.

                         MRS. DAVIS
            I looked everywhere, honey, but all
            I could find was your hat.

                         ANDY
                   (groggy)
            But what if we leave them behind?

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Oh, don't worry, honey, I'm sure
            we'll find Woody and Buzz before we
            leave tomorrow.

Andy's eyes shut.  Mom turns out the light and quietly exits
the room.

A moving box on the floor, with the words "Andy's Toys!"
scrawled on it, begins to shake from side to side.

                         REX (O.S.)
                   (muffled)
            Aaaah!  I need air!

Rex pops out of the top of the box, COUGHING a packing
styrofoam peanut out of his mouth.  Potato Head appears
beside him.

                         REX
                   (relieved)
            Aa-a-a-a-ah!
                   (COUGH)

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Will you quit moving around?!

                         REX
            I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so
            nervous before I travel.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            How did I get stuck with YOU as a
            moving buddy?

Potato Head drops back down into the box.

                         REX
                   (following Potato Head)
            Everyone else was picked.

BO PEEP

peeks around the corner of one of the boxes and looks up at
Andy fast asleep clutching his cowboy hat.

                         BO PEEP
            Oh, Woody, if only you could see
            how much Andy misses you.

EXT. SID'S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

THUNDER RUMBLES as rain pours down outside the spooky dwelling.

INT. SID'S ROOM

Sid is in bed fast asleep.

Woody struggles to move his milkcrate jail, but with the
weight of the toolbox on top it won't budge.

Woody looks across the desktop at Buzz sitting dejectedly
with the rocket strapped to his back.

                         WOODY
            Ps-s-s-s-t!  Psst!  Hey, Buzz!

No reaction from Buzz.

Woody picks up a stray washer from the desktop and flings it
at Buzz, striking his helmet.

Buzz lifts his head and turns lifelessly to look at Woody.

                         WOODY
            Hey!  Get over here and see if you
            can get this tool box off me.

Buzz just looks away from Woody and bows his head.

                         WOODY
            Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I
            can't do this without you.  I need
            your help.

                         BUZZ
            I can't help.  I can't help anyone.

                         WOODY
            Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can
            get me out of here and then I'll
            get that rocket off you, and we'll
            make a break for Andy's house.

                         BUZZ
            Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's
            the difference.

                         WOODY
            Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall.
            You must not be thinking clearly.

                         BUZZ
            No, Woody, for the first time I am
            thinking clearly.
                   (looking at himself)
            You were right all along.  I'm not
            a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A
            stupid little insignificant toy.

                         WOODY
            Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being
            a toy is a lot better than being a
            Space Ranger.

                         BUZZ
            Yeah, right.

                         WOODY
            No, it is.  Look, over in that
            house is a kid who thinks you are
            the greatest, and it's not because
            you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's
            because you're a TOY!  You are HIS
            toy.

                         BUZZ
            But why would Andy want me?

                         WOODY
            Why would Andy want you?!  Look at
            you!  You're a Buzz Lightyear.  Any
            other toy would give up his moving
            parts just to be you.  You've got
            wings, you glow in the dark, you
            talk, your helmet does that -- that
            whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy.

Woody pauses and looks at himself.

                         WOODY
                   (continued; depressed)
            As a matter of fact you're too cool.
            I mean -- I mean what chance does a
            toy like me have against a Buzz
            Lightyear action figure?  All I can
            do is...

Woody pulls his own pull-string.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            There's a snake in my boots!

Woody bows his head.

                         WOODY
            Why would Andy ever want to play
            with me, when he's got you?
                   (pause)
            I'm the one that should be strapped
            to that rocket.

Woody slumps dejectedly against the crate, his back to Buzz.

Buzz lifts up his foot.

ANGLE: THE SOLE OF BUZZ'S FOOT

The signature "ANDY" reads through the dirt and scuff marks.

Buzz gazes back at Woody.  A look of determination spreads
across his face.

                         WOODY
            Listen Buzz, forget about me.  You
            should get out of here while you can.

Silence.

Woody turns around.

Buzz is gone.

Suddenly, the entire milkcrate begins to shake.  Woody looks
up to see...

BUZZ

He is on top of the milkcrate, trying to push the tool box off.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I
            thought you were --

                         BUZZ
            Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid
            over in that house who needs us.
            Now let's get you out of this thing.

                         WOODY
            Yes Sir!

Both Buzz and Woody push the milkcrate and together, they
finally get it to move but it's slow progress.

                         WOODY
                   (strained)
            Come on, Buzz!  We can do it!

SFX: TRUCK

The two toys stop to look out the window by the workbench.

ANGLE: OUT SID'S BEDROOM WINDOW

With the rain stopped and the sun beginning to rise...

A MOVING TRUCK

can be seen pulling up in front of Andy's house.

                         BUZZ
            Woody!  It's the moving van.

                         WOODY
            We've got to get out of here...NOW.

Buzz braces himself between the tool chest and the wall.

Using his legs, Buzz pushes with all his might.  The toolbox
begins to move.

Woody notices that with every shove Buzz gives to the tool
chest, the milkcrate begins to edge out over the lip of the
desk.

                         WOODY
            C'mon, Buzz.

Finally the gap is wide enough for Woody to jump through.
Woody drops down to the floor below.

                         WOODY
                   (loud whisper)
            Alright.  Buzz!  Hey!  I'm out!

Buzz doesn't hear Woody and continues to shove the toolbox
(and milkcrate) farther out.

                         BUZZ
            ...almost
                   (GRUNT)
            ...there
                   (GRUNT)
            ...

Woody looks up just in time to see the entire toolbox and
milkcrate topple towards him.

                         WOODY
                   (nervous laugh)

The toolbox CRASHES right on top of Woody.

Buzz falls onto the desktop and glances over to Sid, who
stirs...

                         SID
                   (in his sleep)
            I wanna ride the pony...

Sid does not wake.  Buzz heaves a SIGH OF RELIEF, then peers
over the edge of the workbench.

                         BUZZ
            Woody!  Woody?!  Are you alright?!

Woody lifts himself out from under the rubble.

                         WOODY
                   (punch-drunk)
            No, I'm fine...I'm okay...

SFX: ALARM CLOCK

It goes off by Sid's bed.  Woody drops back under the
toolbox and Buzz goes limp.

Sid groggily sits up for a beat, then his eyes light up.

                         SID
            Oh, yeah!  Time for lift-off!

Sid jumps out of bed, grabs Buzz and bolts out of the room.

                         SID (O.S.)
            TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!!

Woody leaps to his feet, runs across the room, and catches
the door just before it closes.  As he swings the door back
open Woody is confronted by...

SCUD

The dog barrels down the hallway straight for Woody.

                         WOODY
            Aaah!  Back!  Back!  Down!  Down!

Woody slams the door shut just in time.  Scud BARKS AND
SCRATCHES at the door.

                         WOODY
                   (out of breath; to himself)
            Okay, what do I do?  Come on Woody,
            think!

Woody looks across the room.

THE MUTANT TOYS

have appeared all around the room.

                         WOODY
            Guys!

The mutant toys all scatter and hide.

                         WOODY
            No, no, no!  Wait!  Wait!  Listen!
            Please!  There's a good toy down
            there and he's -- he's going to be
            blown to bits in a few minutes all
            because of me.  I've gotta save him!
                   (pause)
            -- But I need your help.

No response.

Woody then notices Babyface timidly peeking out of the
shadows from under the bed.

                         WOODY
            Please.  He's my friend.  He's the
            only one I've got.

Babyface crawls out and bangs in code on the side of Sid's
metal bedpost.

The mutant toys emerge from the shadows, and gather around
Woody.  He kneels down into a huddle with them.

                         WOODY
                   (to Babyface)
            Thank you.
                   (to the others)
            Okay.  I think I know what to do.
            We're going to have to break a few
            rules, but if it works, it'll help
            everybody.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM

THE MOVERS cart out the last load.  A forlorn Andy clutches
onto Buzz's "spaceship" box in one hand and his cowboy hat
in the other.

Andy scans the empty room and heaves a sad SIGH.

EXT. BACKYARD SHED

Sid comes out of the she carrying a bunch of materials under
his arm.

                         SID
                   (as Astronaut)
            Houston to Mission Control.  Come
            in, Control.

He drops the junk down beside an inanimate Buzz.

                         SID
                   (continued)
            Launch pad is being constructed!
            Heh-heh.

SID'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Scud is planted right outside Sid's bedroom door, poised to
attack anything that exits.

INT. SID'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Woody has created a little diagram of the house and yard out
of dominoes and Scrabble tiles.  He points to it with a
pencil as he addresses the mutants.

                         WOODY
            All right, listen up.  I need Pump
            Boy here -- Ducky here.  Legs?

LEGS, the toy fishing rod with fashion doll legs, steps
forward from the crowd.

                         WOODY
                   (continued; to Legs)
            You're with Ducky.
                   (to the others)
            RollerBob and I don't move till we
            get the signal.  Clear?

The mutants all give an affirmative nod.

                         WOODY
            Okay, let's move!

The toys all break.

Legs and DUCKY, a duck head Pez dispenser with baby doll
torso and plunger base, rush over to a heating grate and
pull the face plate off the wall.  They disappear into the
heating duct.

INT. HEATING DUCT - CONTINUOUS

Ducky and Legs come to an intersection.  Ducky QUACKS and
they head down the right tunnel.

INT. SID'S ROOM

HAND-IN-THE-BOX, the rubber hand in the Jack-in-the-box,
stacks on top of several mutant toys to reach the doorknob
of the bedroom door.

Woody hops onto ROLLERBOB, a skateboard with a soldier's
upper torso tied to its front.

                         WOODY
            Wind the frog!

WALKING CAR, a Hot Wheels car with baby arms, begins winding
up THE FROG, a tin wind-up frog with monster truck wheels
instead of legs.

INT. SID'S HOUSE/PORCH ATTIC

A bottom of wall insulation is pushed aside to reveal Ducky
and Legs.  They make their way towards a junction box
sitting in the center of the floor.

Ducky and Legs lift the loose junction box.

EXT. SID'S HOUSE/FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS

THE BROKEN PORCH LIGHT

suddenly lifts upward and disappears into the roof.

Ducky extends his Pez neck out of the hole to check that the
coast is clear.

INT. SID'S ROOM

All the toys have manned their positions and wait silently,
their eyes fixed on Woody.

                         WOODY
            Wait for the signal.

INT. PORCH ATTIC

Ducky takes the end of the line off Legs' fishing reel,
hooks it onto himself, and is then lowered down through the
open hole.

EXT. FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS

Hanging halfway down the front door, Ducky begins to swing.
Eventually he swings far enough to reach his destination:
the doorbell.

Ducky presses it.

SFX: DOORBELL

INT. SID'S ROOM

Woody throws his arm down.

                         WOODY
            Go!!

Hand-in-the-box throws open the door and The Frog is let loose.

The Frog zips through Scud's legs and down the hallway.
Scud chases after it and follows it down the stairs.

SFX: DOORBELL

                         HANNAH (O.S.)
            I'll get it!

Woody helps the rest of the mutant toys onto the skateboard.

                         WOODY
            Alright, let's go.

Using his front arms, Rollerbob propels the skateboard and
crew out into the hallway.

INT. SID'S HOUSE/ENTRYWAY

SFX: DOORBELL

Hannah walks to the front door...

                         HANNAH
            I'm coming!  I'm coming!

...and opens it.

EXT./INT. FRONT DOORWAY - CONTINUOUS

Nobody's there.

Hannah doesn't notice Ducky stuck to the porch floor by his
plunger.

THE FROG

zooms down the stairs with Scud BARKING right behind.  The
Frog leaps off the last step, speeds through Hannah's legs
and out the open front door.

Hannah looks back inside at Scud.  In that moment, Ducky
catches the Frog and is quickly reeled upwards back into the
roof.

Scud bursts through Hannah's legs, knocking her over, and
runs out onto the empty porch.

                         HANNAH
                   (annoyed)
            SCUD!!!

Scud suddenly realizes he's been duped, but before he can
get back inside, Hannah slams the front door shut.

                         HANNAH
            Stupid dog.

Scud smashes into the closed door and begins BARKING furiously.

As Hannah storms off into another room she doesn't notice
Woody and the mutants zipping off the stairs and round the
corner, heading straight into the kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

By now RollerBob has really picked up speed.  He shoots
underneath the kitchen table, through the maze of chair
legs, straight towards...

THE PET DOOR

                         WOODY
            Lean back!

The mutants all push back causing the RollerBob to do a
wheelie.  They smash through the doggie door...

EXT. SID'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

...and catapult into the bushes.

The toys peek out from the bush to see Buzz strapped to the
launchpad.  Sid is still in the toolshed.

                         SID (O.S.; AS ASTRONAUT)
            Uh, Mission Control...is the
            launchpad construction complete? --
                   (simulated static)
            Uh, Roger, rocket is now secured to
            guide wire.  We are currently
            obtaining the...ignition sticks.
            Countdown will commence momentarily.
            Stand by --
                   (simulated static)


Ducky, Legs, and the Frog shoot out into the yard from a
drain pipe.  They exchange a thumbs-up with Woody.

                         WOODY
                   (to toys in the bush)
            Let's go!

The mutants disperse to their designated places in the yard.

                         SID (O.S.)
            Hey, Mom?!  Where are the matches?
            Oh, oh, wait, here they are.
            Nevermind...

Woody runs towards Buzz, who spots Woody approaching.

                         BUZZ
                   (loud whisper)
            Woody?!  Great!  Help me out of
            this thing!

Woody stops a few feet away from Buzz.

                         WOODY
            Shhhhhhh!

                         BUZZ
            What?!

                         WOODY
                   (loud whisper)
            It's ok.  Everything's under control.

Woody deliberately falls down limp on the grass.

                         BUZZ
            Woody?!  What are you doing?!

Sid emerges from the tool shed.  Buzz freezes.

                         SID (AS ASTRONAUT)
            Houston, all systems are go.
            Requesting permission to launch --
                   (spotting Woody)
            Hey!  How'd you get out here?

Sid picks up Woody, examines him for a beat and then smiles.

                         SID
            Oh, well, you and I can have a
            cookout later.  Ha-ha-ha...

He sticks a match prominently in Woody's holster and tosses
him onto the grill of an open barbecue.

                         SID (AS ASTRONAUT)
            Houston, do we have permission to
            launch? --
                   (simulated static)
            Uh, Roger, permission granted.  You
            are confirmed at T minus 10 seconds...

During Sid's countdown, all the mutants scurry into their
final positions.

Sid lights a match.

                         SID
                   (continued)
            ...and counting.  Ten!  Nine!
            Eight!  Seven!  Six!  Five!  Four!
            Three!  Two!... One!...

Sid grins menacingly as the match moves towards the fuse.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            Reach for the sky!!

                         SID
            Huh?

Sid pulls back from lighting the fuse.  He turns to look at
Woody still lying lifelessly atop the barbecue except for
the sound emitting from his voice box.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            This town ain't big enough for the
            two of us!

                         SID
            What?!

Sid walks over to Woody and picks him up.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            Somebody's poisoned the water hole...

                         SID
            It's busted.

He raises Woody up, about to throw him away --

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            Who are you callin' busted, Buster?!

Sid stops short and looks at Woody again.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
                   (continued)
            That's right.  I'm talking to YOU,
            Sid Phillips.  We don't like being
            blown up, Sid, or smashed, or
            ripped apart...

While Woody's voice box talks, Sid checks the pullstring.

It isn't moving.  Sid GULPS.

                         SID
            W-w-w-we?

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            That's right.
                   (beat)
            Your toys.

The remains of broken toys in the yard, led by the bedroom
mutants, begin rising from the ground in "NIGHT OF THE
LIVING DEAD" fashion.
The toys march forward, forming a circle around Sid.  Sid is
too frightened to scream or move.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            From now on, you must take good
            care of your toys.  Because if you
            don't, we'll find out, Sid.  We
            toys can see...

Woody's inanimate head rotates 360 degrees.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
                   (continued)
            ...everything.

For a split second Woody's face comes to life.

                         WOODY
                   (regular voice)
            So play nice.

Sid drops Woody and bolts inside the house.

                         SID
            AAAAAAAGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!

Woody and all the toys CHEER VICTORIOUSLY.

INT. SID'S ENTRYWAY

Hannah has just come downstairs carrying a new doll when Sid
rushes up to her.

                         SID
            The toys!  The toys are alive!

Sid eyes Hannah's doll and pats it gently on the head.

                         SID
                   (continued)
            N-N-Nice dolly...

Hannah, sensing Sid's fear, suddenly thrusts the doll in
Sid's face.  He SCREAMS and runs upstairs.  Hannah chases
after him, taunting.

                         HAMM
            What's wrong, Sid?!  Don't you want
            to play with Sally?!

EXT. SID'S BACKYARD

The toys are all congratulating one another.
                         WOODY
            Nice work, fellahs.  Good job.
            Comin' out of the ground -- what a
            touch!  That was a stroke of genius.

                         BUZZ
            Woody!

Woody turns around and looks at Buzz, who's still affixed to
Sid's launchpad.  Buzz extends his hand to Woody.

                         BUZZ
            Thanks.

They shake.

                   (depressed)
            Bye, house.

Buzz and Woody look in the direction of Andy's house.

ANGLE: ANDY'S DRIVEWAY - THE FAMILY VAN

Through the fence, Andy and his family can be seen getting
into the van.

                         BUZZ
            Woody!  The van!

Woody quickly hoists Buzz off the pole he was tied to.

                         WOODY
                   (to mutant toys)
            We gotta run!  Thanks, guys.

With the rocket still taped to Buzz, the two toys sprint
towards the fence.

SFX: VAN ENGINE STARTING

                         WOODY
            Quick!

Woody easily slips through the slats in the fence, but
Buzz's rocket causes him to become stuck.

EXT. ANDY'S DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

Woody has climbed up on to the rear bumper of the van before
realizing that Buzz is missing.  He looks back to discover
Buzz stuck in the fence.

                         BUZZ
            Just go!  I'll catch up!

Woody jumps down and runs back for Buzz.

The van begins pulling out of the driveway.

Woody tugs on a loosened slat and breaks Buzz free of the
fence.

The two toys run out into the street just in time to see the
van driving off down the street.

SFX: TRUCK ENGINE

Woody and Buzz turn around.

THE MOVING VAN

drives right over them.  Woody and Buzz SCREAM, ducking just
in time.

After the truck passes, Buzz runs after it with Woody a few
steps behind.

                         BUZZ
            Come on!

ANGLE: SID'S FRONT PORCH

Scud is lying on the porch when he suddenly perks up at the
sight of the two tiny toys running down the street after the
moving truck.

Scud bears his teeth and GROWLS.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET

Buzz runs up close to the truck with Woody still back a few
paces.

A STRAP

dangles off the back of the truck.  Buzz makes a leap for it
and grabs hold.  He climbs up the strap and onto the bumper.

Woody then lunges for the strap but it stays just out of reach.

                         BUZZ
            You can do it, Woody.

Woody gives a mighty leap and catches hold of the strap.

                         WOODY
            Whew, I made it!

Woody begins climbing up when suddenly Buzz goes pale.
Woody looks behind him to see...

SCUD

The dog leaps forward and bites down on one of Woody's legs.

                         WOODY
                   (kicking Scud with
                   other foot)
            Aaaaaahh!!  Get away, you stupid
            dog!  Down!  Down!

Scud tugs on Woody, pulling him down to the end of the strap.

                         BUZZ
            Hold on, Woody!

                         WOODY
            I can't do it!  Take care of Andy
            for me!

                         BUZZ
            NO-O-O-O-O-O-O!!

Buzz leaps off of the truck and onto Scuds snout.  He grabs
Scud's eyelids and snaps them hard.  Scud YELPS, letting go
of Woody.  The dog bucks wildly with Buzz hanging onto his
face.

                         WOODY
            Buzz!

The moving truck continues down the street leaving Buzz and
Scud behind.

Still hanging onto the strap, Woody scrambles up onto the
bumper.  He unlocks the back door of the truck and tries to
lift up the heavy door.

Suddenly, the family van and moving truck come to a stop at
a traffic light.

Woody slams into the door, causing it to fly upward taking
Woody with it.

Hanging from the door, Woody scans the inside of the truck
until he spots what he's looking for.

A PILE OF MOVING BOXES

with the words "ANDY'S TOYS" written on them in crayon.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET

Scud flings Buzz off his face.  Buzz goes tumbling under a
parked car.  Scud runs over to the car, but is too big to
get under it.

INT. BACK OF MOVING TRUCK

Woody rips into one of Andy's boxes.

ANGLE: INSIDE OF BOX

All the toys wince and MOAN as they cover their eyes from
the sudden brightness.

                         TOYS
            What?!

                         REX
            Are we there already?

                         SLINKY
            Woody?!  How'd you --

Woody's response is to slide the box aside and begin
rummaging through the next box.

Slinky, Potato Head, Rex and the other toys GRUMBLE IN
CONFUSION as they poke their heads up out of the first box.

                         WOODY
            Ah-hah!  There you are!!

Woody pulls the RC Car and its remote out of the second box.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Hey!  What's he doing?

Woody runs to the back of the truck and throws the RC Car
out onto the street.  The other toys SCREAM in horror.

                         REX
            He's at it again!

INTERCUT - EXT. STREET/INT. REAR OF MOVING TRUCK

Woody turns on the remote and steers the RC car past Scud
and under the parked car where Buzz is hiding.

RC's motor WHIRRS happily at the sight of Buzz.

The traffic light turns green allowing the van and truck to
cross the intersection.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
                   (pointing at Woody)
            Get him!!!

All the toys pour out of their boxes and CHARGE on Woody.

                         WOODY
            Ah-h!!  Ah-h!  No, no!

Woody continues to steer the remote while trying to avoid
the angry mob of toys.

Buzz jumps on to the RC car and they zoom back towards the
moving truck.

Scud is right on their heels and is about to chomp down on
Buzz --

Rocky picks up Woody and spins him over his head.

                         WOODY
            No, no, no!  Wait!
                   (as Rocky spins him)
            Whoa-Whoa-Whoa...!

-- The RC car suddenly swerves from Scud's jaws and starts
doing doughnuts (matching Woody's) in the middle of the street.

                         BUZZ
                   (spinning)
            Whoa-Whoa-Whoa...!

Rocky throws Woody to the floor.

-- RC resumes his course straight down the street with Scud
giving close chase.

Hamm leaps off a pile of boxes and onto Woody.

                         HAMM
            Pig pile!!

-- The RC car hops up in the air, tossing Buzz up and off.
Buzz manages to land back on RC, but facing backwards.

ANGLE: TRAFFIC LIGHT

It changes red again and the wall of cross traffic resumes.

Buzz and the RC car drive straight into it.

Scud blindly follows them into the traffic and skids to a
halt just missing a car.  The car swerves and CRASHES into
another car.  Soon there is a multi-car pile up that
encircles Scud, entrapping the dog.

Buzz and the RC car emerge from the intersection safely on
the other side.

INT. BACK OF MOVING TRUCK

The mob of toys lift up Woody (still holding the remote) and
head for the open back.

                         WOODY
            No wait!  You don't understand!
            Buzz is out there!  We've gotta
            help him!!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Toss 'im overboard!

                         WOODY
            No, no, no, wait!

The toys toss him out into the road.  As the truck drives
off, the toys CHEER.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            So long Woody!

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

SFX: CAR HORN

Woody turns around and ducks just in time as a car passes
over him.

Shaken, Woody tries to get up again when...

BUZZ & RC

come barreling towards him.

                         BUZZ
            Who-o-o-oa!  Woody!

The RC Car sweeps up Woody and keeps driving.

Woody finds himself sitting in front of Buzz (still holding
the remote).

                         WOODY
            Well, thanks for the ride.

                         BUZZ
                   (pointing ahead)
            Look out!!

The toys are about to slam into the rear tire of the car
that had passed over Woody earlier.

Woody SCREAMS and gives the steering wheel on the remote a
hard left, missing the tire by inches.  The RC Car moves up
under the car.

                         WOODY
            Now let's catch up to that truck!

ANGLE: RC REMOTE

Woody flicks a switch from "ON" to "TURBO."

The RC Car speeds up towards the moving truck.

INT. BACK OF MOVING TRUCK

The toys are busy CONGRATULATING one another when Lenny, the
wind-up binoculars, glances out the back and spots Buzz and
Woody.

                         LENNY
            Guys!  Guys!  Woody's riding RC!
            And Buzz is with him!

                         TOYS
            What?!!!

The toys rush to the edge of the open truck.  Bo picks up
Lenny and looks through him.

            What have we done?!

                         REX
            Great.  Now I have guilt.
EXT. STREET/BACK OF MOVING TRUCK

The RC Car begins to gain on the truck.

                         WOODY
            We're almost there.

                         BO PEEP
            Rocky!  The ramp!

Rocky, the wrestler doll, rushes over to a lever on the side
of the back.  The sign above it reads "RAMP: UP/DOWN."
Rocky pushes down hard on the lever.  The ramp begins to lower.

Woody & Buzz look up to see the ramp about to come down
right on top of them.

                         BUZZ
            Look out!!

The RC Car pulls back just before the heavy ramp slams into
the road.  Sparks fly everywhere from the metal scraping the
pavement.

                         SLINKY
                   (to other toys)
            Quick!  Hold on to my tail!

Potato Head and Rex grabs on to Slinky's tail allowing
Slinky's front end to jump off the truck and onto the ramp.

Slinky leans forward with his paw outstretched to Woody.
Woody hands the remote to Buzz and leans forward to grab
Slinky's hand.

ANGLE: WOODY & SLINKY'S HANDS

They grab hold of one another.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            That a boy, Slink!!

All of a sudden, the RC Car begins to slow down pulling
Slinky's front end off the ramp.

                         SLINKY
            Woody!!

His slinky middle begins to stretch and stretch...

                         SLINKY
            Woody!  Speed up!

                         BUZZ
            The batteries!  They're running out!

RC's headlight eyes sag.  The car slows even more.

As Slinky continues stretching.  The RC Car begins to weave
side-to-side like a water skier.

                         SLINKY
            Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!

INT. FAMILY VAN

With Mom and Andy preoccupied, baby Molly looks in her
sideview mirror.

ANGLE: PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR

The RC Car (w/ Woody and Buzz) weaves into view and then
back out.

Molly SQUEALS with delight.

EXT. STREET/BACK OF MOVING TRUCK

With Slinky's mid-section stretched to the limit, he begins
to lose his grip on Woody.

                         SLINKY
            I can't hold on much longer!

                         WOODY
            Slink!  Hang on!

Slinky's hand slips, sending his front shooting back into
the moving truck and knocking over all the toys.

The RC Car sputters to a stop.

Woody and Buzz watch in vain as the family van and moving
truck disappear.

Buzz tosses the remote to the ground in frustration.

                         WOODY
                   (sarcastic)

            Woody!  The rocket!

                         WOODY
            The match!

Woody pulls out the match from his holster that Sid had put
there earlier.

                         WOODY
                   (continued)
            Yes!  Thank you, Sid!

Woody runs around behind Buzz, strikes the match against
RC's back tire, and is about to light the fuse when...

A CAR

whizzes right over them, blowing out the match.

Woody clenches the burnt match in his hands and falls
prostrate to the ground.

                         WOODY
            No-o-o!  No-no-no-no!  No-o-o!

Unable to watch a cowboy cry, Buzz bows his head, causing
his helmet to block the sun from Woody.

As Buzz's shadow passes over him, Woody stops whimpering and
looks at his hand.

A WHITE HOT DOT

like the one generated from Sid's magnifying glass, appears
on the back of Woody's hand.

Woody leaps up, grabs Buzz's helmet and aligns it so the
white dot hits the tip of the fuse.

                         BUZZ
            Woody?!  What are you doing?

                         WOODY
            Hold still, Buzz!

The fuse lights.

            Ha-ha!!

                         BUZZ
            You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.

Woody jumps back onto the car then suddenly stops smiling.

                         WOODY
            Wait a minute...I just lit a rocket.
            Rockets explo --

SFX: ROCKET EXPLOSION

The RC Car rockets forward.  Speeding along the dividing
line in the road, it easily passes car after car until the
moving truck can be seen on the horizon.

EXT. BACK OF MOVING TRUCK

The toys are gathered around Slinky, his spring splayed out
on the floor.

                         SLINKY
            I shoulda held on longer.

Lenny looks out the back again.

                         LENNY
            Look!  Look!  It's Woody and Buzz!
            Comin' up fast!

The toys run to the opening and CHEER.

ANGLE: BUZZ AND WOODY

The rocket is so strong that it begins to lift Buzz and
Woody off the RC Car.  Woody manages to continue holding
onto RC -- but not for long.

The toys CHEERING turns to SCREAMING as they rush to get out
of the way of the oncoming "RC rocket."

                         REX
            Take cover!!

Woody is forced to let go of the RC Car.

They separate, sending the two toys upward and RC into the
back of the truck.

RC smashes into Potato Head, sending all of his parts flying.

EXT. SKY - BUZZ AND WOODY

The rocket hurtles upward higher and higher.

                         WOODY
            Ahhh!! This is the part where we
            blow up!

                         BUZZ
            Not today!

Buzz confidently presses the button on his chest.

WINGS

jut out of Buzz, severing the tape that holds him to rocket.
The toys separate from the rocket just before it BLOWS UP.

The toys plummet.

                         WOODY
                   (covering his eyes)
            Ah-h-h-h-h!!

Just then Buzz banks under some power lines and soars upward
again.  Woody takes a peek.

They're flying.

                         WOODY
            Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!

                         BUZZ
            This isn't flying.  This is

                         WOODY
            Ha ha!!  To Infinity and Beyond!!

They soar gracefully towards the moving truck, but then pass
over it.

                         WOODY
            Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!

                         BUZZ

Buzz and Woody fly right over the van's sun roof and then
drop into the car.

INT. FAMILY VAN - CONTINUOUS

Before anyone can notice, Woody and Buzz land in an open box
in the back seat right next to Andy.

Andy turns to discover the limp Buzz and Woody lying in the

            Right where you left them.

Andy hugs both toys.

One of the Christmas bulbs moves aside to reveal...

The plastic green soldier spies on the Davis family with his
binoculars.  He turns and motions back into the tree.

INT. CHRISTMAS TREE

A baby monitor sits wedged between some branches supported
by several green army men.  One of the soldiers turns it on.

Woody and the rest of the toys are MINGLING together like a
typical office Christmas party.

                         REX
            Oh!  It's time!

The toys all stop and run towards the monitor.

Woody is about to follow when a crook pulls him backwards to

            Mm-hmmmmm.

Bo drops her crook, dips Woody and KISSES him.

The rest of the toys have congregated below the monitor
restless with "excitement" not fear.

                         REX
                   (to Slinky)
            Maybe Andy'll get another dinosaur,
            like a leaf-eater.  That way, I
            could play the, uh, dominant
            predator.  Ha ha ha!

Slinky LAUGHS with Rex.

                         BUZZ
            Quiet everyone, quiet!

            Molly's first present i-i-is...Mrs.
            Potato Head.  Repeat.  A Mrs.
            Potato Head.

                         HAMM
            Way to go, Idaho!

All the toys CONGRATULATE Potato Head.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Gee, I better shave.

Potato Head whips off his moustache piece.

Woody climbs up onto the bed and joins Buzz.  Lipstick now
covers Woody's face.

                   (over monitor)
            Come in, Frankincense.  Andy is now
            opening his first present --

Buzz bangs on the side of the monitor.  Nothing.

                         WOODY
            Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not
            worried, are you?

                         SARGENT (O.S.)
                   (over monitor)
            I can't quite make out --

                         BUZZ
                   (defensively)
            Me?  No, no, no, no...
                   (beat)
            Are you?

                         WOODY
                   (laughing)
            Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly
            get that is worse than you?!

We TRUCK OUT through the window to the EXT. as we HEAR...

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Oh, what is it?  What is it?

SFX: BARKING

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Wow!  A puppy!

We ZOOM BACK through the window to a CLOSE UP of Buzz and
Woody.

They look at one another with a half-smile, half-grimace and
LAUGH WEAKLY.

                                            FADE OUT.

         1     EXT.   DESERT VALLEY - DAY                                   1

               The high desert -- absolutely silent -- a vast, hard land-
               scape stretching away to distant mountains.  The silence is
               broken by hoof-beats.


         2     EXT.  EDGAR'S PLACE - DAY                                    2

               It's a simple cabin dwarfed by a big, ramshackle barn.  EDGAR
               DEEMS (60s), a weathered desert rat of a hermit, is walking
               his donkey around in circles.

               Now, rattling toward them down an endless dirt road, comes an
               old, sun-bleached Buick.  It stops and out leans OLD FRED
               (70s) wearing a sweat-stained fedora.  The two friends nod.

                                          OLD FRED
                            How's she doing?

                                          EDGAR
                            She wants to lay down.  I'm a
                            little worried.

               Old Fred climbs out with a bushel basket of carrots.

                                          OLD FRED
                            Well, I brung her something I know
                            she likes.

                                          EDGAR
                            Damn, Fred, you can't give away all
                            those.

                                          OLD FRED
                            Forget it.  I got vegetables coming
                            out my ears.  Usually the varmints
                            eat up half my crop, but lately I
                            ain't so much as seen a gopher or a
                            jack-rabbit nowheres.

                                          EDGAR
                            If that ain't the truth.  And I
                            count on them for a little bit of
                            stew meat...Thank you, Fred.

               Edgar takes the carrots and feeds one to the donkey.

                                          EDGAR (cont'd)
                            Here you go, Justine.  Look what
                            Fred brought you.

                                          OLD FRED
                            We playing cards tonight?

                                          EDGAR
                            I think I'm gonna be sitting up
                            with her.

                                          OLD FRED
                            I'd do the same.  Well, catch you
                            Thursday.

                                          EDGAR
                            You bet.

               The men nod, and Old Fred drives off.

               CLOSE-UP of the donkey's hooves thumping along as Edgar leads
               her to the barn.

                                          EDGAR (cont'd)
                            Let's get you out of the sun for a
                            spell.

                                          EDGAR (cont'd)
                            I'll get you some fresh water.

               But, suddenly, we hear the donkey restlessly stomping its
               hooves and braying.  Edgar turns, concerned.  Now we hear an
               odd sound.  Distant thunder?  The wind?  The donkey gets more
               and more frantic.

               The barn shudders violently.  Frightened birds explode from
               the eaves.  Dust puffs from every old seam.  Roof shingles
               rain down.  Edgar stares in amazement.

                                          EDGAR (cont'd)
                            ...some kind of earthquake!?

               Then another sound -- the donkey starts screeching in wild
               panic.

                                          EDGAR (cont'd)
                            Justine, hang on! I'm coming!

               Edgar races back to the barn and flings open the doors.


         3     INT.  EDGAR'S BARN - DAY                                     3

               Dust swirls through the air.  But -- the barn in empty.  No
               donkey.  Now Edgar is hit by a ghastly stench.  He staggers
               back, and covers his nose with a handkerchief.  Then he sees,
               splattered across the walls -- blood!

                                          EDGAR
                            What in the name of Jehovah...?

               He raises his arms above the door frame.  When he lowers them
               he's holding a 12 gauge shotgun.  He races outside, ready to
               shoot, but there's nothing -- as far as the eye can see.


         4     EXT.  CLIFFS - DAWN                                          4

               The sun lights up spectacular sheer cliffs which plunge 1000
               feet from a ruggedly beautiful high-desert plateau.  At the
               top of the cliffs, silhouetted against the dawn, a lone cow-
               boy seems to gaze in deep contemplation at the sunrise.  As
               we MOVE IN, we realize he's actually peeing over the cliff.

               This is VALENTINE MCKEE (25).  Smart and good looking, Val
               has nevertheless managed to underachieve brilliantly.  He
               coasts through life, following the path of least resistance
               -- which has brought him to this dubious rustic existence on
               the edge of civilization.  But lately he's beginning to
               wonder why he hasn't accomplished more in his 25 years.

               As a few sleepy cows gaze at him, sleepy Val shuffles over to
               his battered old pickup truck.  A hand-painted sign on the
               door reads: "V & E -- All Type's of Job's."  Indeed, the
               pick-up bed is jumbled with tools and supplies for every
               conceivable odd job -- and the noisily snoring form of his
               partner huddled in a dirty sleeping bag.  Val raps on the
               side of the truck.

                                          VAL
                                   (softly)
                            Good morning, Mr. Bassett, this is
                            your wake-up call.  Please move
                            your fat ass.

               No response from the sleeping bag.  Val stares at the cows
               chewing their cud -- and perks up as he gets an idea.  He
               gently steps onto the truck's running board, then suddenly
               starts jumping up and down as hard as he can, rocking the
               truck violently.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            STAMPEDE!  EARL, GET OUT OF THE
                            WAY!

               The sleeping bag tries to get up and run for it.  It tumbles
               out of the back of the pickup.  While Val laughs uproar-
               iously, EARL BASSET (43) claws his way out of the bag, looks
               around wildly, and finds himself staring at three motionless
               cows.

                                          EARL
                            You dumb shit.

               Earl is a good-ol' boy who has lived his life just like Val,
               drifting from job to job.  He knows why he hasn't accom-
               plished anything, and often tries to impart his hard-won
               wisdom to Val, but the last thing the younger man wants is
               advice.

               Earl stretches.  The men begin a silent ritual:  Earl gropes
               through his pockets for a cigarette, but only finds a
               lighter.  Meanwhile, Val digs in his pockets, coming up with
               cigarettes, but no lighter.  Typical of these two, each guy
               always has half of what he needs.  Eventually they sort it
               out,  trading the necessary implements.

               Earl reaches for a coffee-pot on a battered Coleman stove on
               the tailgate.  But it's cold.

                                          EARL
                            You didn't cook breakfast?

                                          VAL
                            Did it yesterday.  Franks and
                            beans.

                                          EARL
                                   (tries to recall)
                            No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.

                                          VAL
                            Hell you did.  Your turn.

               Earl raises his fist.  This is The Challenge, and it instantly
               triggers the partners' conflict-resolution technique.  They
               solve all disputes using the children's game of "scissors,
               rock, paper."  Earl raises his fist in response.  The game is
               played swiftly and silently -- one, two, three.  On three,
               Val mimes "paper" (open hand.  Earl mimes "scissors" (two
               extended fingers).  Scissors cuts paper.  Val has lost.  He
               shrugs and starts pumping up the stove fuel tank.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Well, when I'm your age I'll
                            probably forget what I eat, too.


         4A    EXT.  DESERT VALLEY - FENCE - DAY                          4A

               Val and Earl are restringing a dilapidated, and seemingly
               endless, barbed wire fence.  A few bored cows watch them.

                                          VAL
                            How many cows does it take to make
                            a stampede?  Is it like three or
                            more?  Is there a minimum speed?

                                          EARL
                                   (shakes his head)
                            I was in one.  A bolt of lightning
                            blew up cottonwood tree.  Three
                            hundred head going hell-bent for
                            the horizon.  Wasn't so damn funny,
                            I can  tell you.

               Earl's hand slips and the fence snags him right through his
               thick glove.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            Ow!  God damn!  Is this a job for
                            intelligent men?!

                                          VAL
                            If there was one nearby I'd
                            probably ask him.

                                          EARL
                            I keep thinking, if we were but
                            half serious about money, we should
                            quit being hired hands and...

                                          VAL
                                   (mock serious)
                            Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.

                                          EARL
                            Whatever the hell we are, we should
                            quit and go get ourselves some real
                            employment.

               Val gestures to the vastness around them.

                                          VAL
                            What, and give up all this personal
                            freedom?


         5     EXT.  JEEP TRAIL - DAY                                       5

               Val guides the truck down a tortuous, rocky, almost impas-
               sable trail.  It takes full concentration as he fights the
               steering wheel, shifts, rides the brake and leans out trying
               to pick a decent route.  Earl braces his feet on the dash and
               munches breakfast, a raw hot dog right out of the package.

                                          VAL
                            Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every
                            year.

                                          EARL
                                   (shrugs)
                            Has a lot of rain.

               Earl pulls a box of Hershey bars from under the seat.  There's
               only one bar left.  He sets the box down between them.  Val
               glances at it -- and raises his fist: The Challenge.  One,
               two, three.  Val mimes "paper;" Earl mimes "rock."  Earl
               loses.  Val takes the bar.

                                          EARL
                                   (pointing ahead)
                            You're gonna get us hung up.

                                          VAL
                            Do not talk to the driver.

               THWONK!  The truck lurches to a stop, its frame caught on a
               big rock.  Val glares at Earl.


         6     EXT. DESERT INTERSECTION - PICK-UP TRUCK - DAY               6

               The pick-up turns from a dirt road onto an old paved road.

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            What do we have next?


         7     INT.  PICK-UP - MOVING - DAY                                 7

               Earl consults a crumpled list pulled from inside his hat.

                                          EARL
                            Uh...Digging that waterhole for
                            Nestor.

                                          VAL
                            Burt and Heather's place is closer.
                            Let's do their kitchen today.  Do
                            Nestor tomorrow.

                                          EARL
                            Nestor's out of town tomorrow.  We
                            don't dig today.  We don't get paid
                            today.  Damn it, Valentine, you
                            never plan ahead.  You never take
                            the long view.  Hell, here it is
                            Monday and I'm already working on
                            Wednesday.
                                   (squints dubiously at
                                    his schedule)
                            It is Monday, right?

               But Val is peering at the desert up ahead.  Off the road a
               ways is a small Toyota pick-up truck and, beside it, a lone
               figure trying to flag them down.

                                          VAL
                            Who the hell's that?  That's not
                            what's his name...the grad student?

                                          EARL
                            Nah, it's September.  Must be the
                            new one.

                                          VAL
                            The new one!  That's supposed to be
                            a girl!

               Earl braces himself, knowing what Val will do.  Val swerves
               the truck wildly off the road, barreling across the desert.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                                   (almost praying)
                            You will have long blonde hair, big
                            green eyes, nice full breasts that
                            stand up and say hello, ass that
                            won't quit.  And legs, legs that go
                            all the way up!

               Earl shakes his head, mildly bemused as they slide to a stop
               in a cloud of dust.


         8     EXT.  DESERT - RHONDA'S TRUCK - DAY                          8

               Val looks out hopefully.  The dust clears.  He sees her --
               RHONDA LeBECK, (25).  Val's eyes do an expert vertical scan:
               short brown hair, small brown eyes, so-so chest, legs hidden
               in baggy dungarees.

               Laden with a portable computer, notebooks, and some
               seismograph printouts, she stares at him through tilted
               glasses.  Her little pick-up truck is loaded with geology
               field equipment.  She shakes Val's hand firmly.

                                          RHONDA
                                   (brightly)
                            Hi, I'm Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.
                            I'm up here for the semester...

                                          VAL
                            Yeah, geography.

                                          RHONDA
                            Right, geology.  And you have to be
                            Val and Earl.  I've heard all about
                            you.

                                          EARL
                            We deny everything.

               Rhonda smiles.

                                          RHONDA
                            Listen, got a question for you.  Do
                            you know if anybody is doing any
                            blasting or drilling or anything
                            like that?

                                          VAL
                            Around here?  Why would they?

                                          RHONDA
                            Well, I'm supposed monitor these
                            seismographs.  You know, they
                            measure vibrations...

                                          VAL
                            Yeah, vibrations in the ground.

                                          RHONDA
                            Yeah, well, I'm getting what I
                            refer to scientifically as "weird
                            vibes."  every sensor I've got is
                            giving me strange readings.  I
                            mean, the school has had these
                            machines up here three years and
                            they've never recorded anything
                            like this.

                                          EARL
                            Well, we'll ask around.  Let you
                            know if we hear of anything.

                                          RHONDA
                            Thanks.  God, I hope they're not
                            screwed up.  I might have to bag
                            the whole semester. Anyway, sorry
                            to bother you.

                                          EARL
                            No problem.  Nice meeting you.
                            Hope you get it sorted out.

               Rhonda unhappily turns back to her equipment as Val and Earl
               drive off.


         9     INT.  PICK-UP TRUCK - MOVING - DAY                           9

               Earl glances over at Val with a gleam in his eye.

                                          EARL
                            You know, if you wanted, we could
                            take a look at those seismographs
                            for her.

                                          VAL
                            What the hell do we know about
                            seismographs?

                                          EARL
                            Nothing.  But it sure might be a
                            nice way of getting to know her.

                                          VAL
                            Why?

                                          EARL
                            Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go
                            for any gal unless she fits that
                            damn list of yours A to Z...

                                          VAL
                            Well, sure.

                                          EARL
                            ...And is dumber than my hind end.
                            Like that Bobby Lynn Dexter...

               Val flips down the truck's sunvisor.  Tapes to it are snap-
               shots of nearly identical blonde bimbos.  Val points to one.



                                          VAL
                                   (defensively)
                            Tammy Lynn Baxter.

                                          EARL
                            Don't matter.  They're all the
                            same: dead weight.  Can't make a
                            decision, can't walk because of
                            their shoes, can't work because of
                            their fingernails.  Make my skin
                            crawl!

                                          VAL
                            Well, I'm a victim of circumstance.

                                          EARL
                            I thought you called it your
                            pecker.  Look, don't make the
                            mistake I made.  Twenty years of
                            looking for a woman exactly like
                            Miss October 1968, and where'd it
                            get me?  Here with you.

               Val rolls his eyes -- "Give me a break."


         10    EXT.  PERFECTION - ESTABLISH - DAY                           10

               The pick-up rattles toward a tiny, utterly isolated high
               desert hamlet -- a few dozen houses and mobile homes fighting
               for shade in the vast landscape.  Its most prominent feature
               is an aging wood-frame water tower, perhaps 25 feet high,
               near the center of town.  A sign PANS into view --
               "PERFECTION -- Pop. 14."


         11    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 11

               Val and Earl head past the water tower for Pham Van's General
               Store, Perfection's main gossip stop and only business.  The
               store's sign, in English and Vietnamese, reads: "Groceries,
               Haircuts, Post Office, Town Hall, VIDEOS!"  Val and Earl park
               next to a camouflage-painted, large-tired Blazer.

               Just then they spot MELVIN, the town's surly teen-aged pain-
               in-the-ass, coming toward them, mindlessly bouncing a
               basketball off the hoods of parked cars.  As he nears their
               truck:

                                          EARL
                            Melvin, touch that truck and die.

                                          MELVIN
                            Oh, man, I'm really shaking.

               But he steers clear of their truck.


         12    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                               12

               Inside, the energetic Vietnamese owner, PHAM VAN, presides
               over his all-purpose establishment: part general store, part
               barber shop, part saloon.

               At the bar are BURT GUMMER and his wife HEATHER, two no-
               nonsense survivalists who have settled in Perfection to await
               the coming apocalypse -- a nice enough couple, but there's a
               hint of paranoia around the edges.  Burt is shoving a box of
               cartridges across to Pham.

                                          BURT
                            No, Pham, they're not hollow
                            points.  I ordered hollow points
                            and that's what I want.

               When Val and Earl enter, Pham automatically pops the tops on
               two cold beers and has them in place before the cowboys reach
               the bar.  Everyone exchanged nods.

                                          HEATHER
                            Hi, guys, what you been up to?

                                          VAL
                            Ran into the new college student,
                            Rona.

                                          EARL
                            Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.  She's
                            getting some kind of strange
                            readings on her things.

                                          BURT
                            Damn, you know, those kids turn up
                            oil or uranium or something out
                            there...next thing the Feds will be
                            at our door.  "Sorry, time to move.
                            Eminent domain."

                                          HEATHER
                            Down, honey, down.

                                          VAL
                            Yeah, Burt.  The way you worry,
                            you're gonna have a heart attack
                            before you get to survive World War
                            III.

               Heather and Pham laugh.  Burt smiles patiently.  Just then
               the compressor in Pham's ice cream freezer comes on.  It's a
               loud chug-chug-chug sound mixed with a high-pitched squeal.

                                          PHAM VAN
                            Hey Val, listen.  Bearing going
                            out, you think?

                                          VAL
                            Could be.

               He starts toward the compressor, but Earl heads him off.

                                          EARL
                            Catch it later, Pham.  Gotta get
                            over to Nestor's.

                                          VAL
                            Right.  We plan ahead.  That way we
                            don't do anything right now.  Earl
                            explained it to me.

               As they turn to go, Val does a take, amazed, as he spots a
               decorative bleached-out cattle skull displayed on the counter
               -- with a $29.95 price tag.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Hey, Pham Van, what the hell is
                            this?

                                          BURT
                            A beauty, isn't it?  We bought three
                            of them for the rec room.

                                          VAL
                                   (whispers to Pham Van)
                            We sell 'em to you for three bucks
                            a piece!

                                          PHAM VAN
                                   (deadpan)
                            And I appreciate it.

                                          VAL
                                   (playfully)
                            You don't get it, Pham.  The idea
                            was: we were ripping you off.

               Suddenly a car alarm blares from outside.  Burt's out the
               door in a flash.  The others follow.


         13    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 13

               Burt races out and shouts at Melvin who back guiltily away
               from Burt's camouflage Blazer.

                                          BURT
                            Melvin, you little pain-in-the-ass!

                                          MELVIN
                            It wasn't me, man!  Your truck's
                            just screwed up, that's all.

               Burt angrily switches off the alarm.  Val and Earl laugh as
               they climb into their truck.

                                          VAL
                            Why don't his parents ever take him
                            to Vegas with them?

                                          EARL
                            You gotta ask that?


         14    EXT.  PIT - DAY                                              14

               At one end of town, Earl maneuvers a huge bulldozer with a
               scoop-loader blade through a choking cloud of dust, scouring
               out a shallow pit to serve as a watering hole.  Val sights
               down a row of stakes which mark one end of the pit.  The job
               is done.  He signals Earl to cut the engine.  Both men have
               kerchiefs covering their faces and are totally encrusted with
               dust.


         15    ANGLE - TRUCK TRAILER - DAY                                  15

               Nearby is an old battered truck trailer -- the massive, solid
               steel kind used for heavy rock hauling.  Tires flat, mired in
               dried mud and weeds, it hasn't been used in years.  Now it
               provides welcome shade as the men sit sipping some coffee.

               NESTOR CUNNINGHAM drives up, surveying the pit with approval.

                                          NESTOR
                            It came out great, boys.  Should
                            fill up just fine come the next
                            rain.  Lemme have your bill.

               Earl and Val start fishing in their pockets for pen and
               paper.  Earl comes up with various pieces of paper, Val with
               three or four pens.  It's a moment before they realize each
               has the other needed implement.  Earl writes out the bill
               during:

                                          NESTOR (cont'd)
                            I'll have to send it to you the
                            first of the month, boys.

               Val and Earl exchange pained looks.

                                          NESTOR (cont'd)
                            Now, you know I'm good for it.

                                          VAL
                            Yeah, Nestor, we know.  Don't worry
                            about it.  Catch us when you can.

               They amble over to their truck.  Earl takes the driver's side
               -- and starts fishing in his pockets for the key.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Are we too easy-going?

                                          EARL
                            No, we're not too easy-going.  This
                            area is economically depressed.

               Val realizes he has the key and hands it over.

                                          VAL
                            So what if we just did it...today.
                            Pack up.  Drive straight down to
                            Bixby.  Get serious.

                                          EARL
                            We could.  We could.  But we'd have
                            to get really serious.  It's gonna
                            cost twice as much to rent a place.

                                          VAL
                            So?  That car wash pays good, and
                            they're always looking.

                                          EARL
                            Car wash?!  That's got no future.
                            If we're gonna take the plunge we
                            oughta have a better plan than
                            that.

                                          VAL
                            Yeah, sure.  Go ahead and plan
                            it...for a year or two.


         16    EXT.  VIOLA'S PLACE - DAY                                    16

               CLOSE ON a stencilled sign: PHAM VAN'S U-RENT -- CESSPOOL,
               SEPTIC TANKS.  PULL OUT to see Val and Earl have rented a
               portable septic pump (perhaps trailer mounted).  The aged
               machine reeks of and drips with its ignoble cargo.  The
               intake hose has been repaired so often it looks to be more
               tape than hose.  Grimacing Val threads the slimy hose down
               through the open top of Viola's cesspool.

               Beside them is Viola's well-kept mobile home on a low hill
               not far from Pham Van's store.  Well-kept flower gardens
               surround the place.  VIOLA, a sweet little old lady, watches
               the men work while straining to hold the leash of her tiny
               but ferocious dog.  The dog yaps continuously, lunging at
               Val and Earl.

                                          VIOLA
                            Stop it!  Stop it, you horrid
                            animal!
                                   (to Val and Earl)
                            I'm going to give her back to my
                            son.  I swear it.

                                          VAL
                            Hey, Viola, you've got my
                            permission.

                                          EARL
                            God almighty, my mama sure didn't
                            raise me for this.

               Val gets up and starts the pump's gas engine.

                                          VAL
                            Well, you're the one won't work in
                            the car wash.  You're the one's
                            gotta have a plan.

                                          EARL
                            Damn it, Val!  Not having a plan is
                            what keeps us doing jobs like this!

               Earl angrily throws the pump valve and starts the pump
               mechanism.  He and Val on stand either side of the intake
               hose as it gurgles happily.

                                          VAL
                            What keeps us doing jobs like this
                            is you dragging your feet.  I was
                            up for going to Bixby.  I was
                            getting excited.

                                          EARL
                            In the past year I must've said a
                            hundred times "We gotta get out of
                            Perfection.  We gotta better
                            ourselves."  You gonna stand there
                            in broad daylight and tell me you
                            think I'm the reason we're still
                            here?  You want to know how close I
                            am to going to Bixby right now?

                                          VAL
                            I'll call that little bluff.  How
                            close?

               POW!  GOOOOSH!  The gurgling intake hose ruptures, showering
               them with -- well you know.  They react as if they'd been
               shot; gagging, staggering, screaming obscenities.


         17    EXT.   VAL AND EARL'S TRAILER - DAY                          17

               Val and Earl's beat-up mobile home is just down the street
               from Pham Van's store.  Val and Earl, now in cleaner clothes,
               march out resolutely.  Val has a portable TV in one hand and
               a framed COORS beer sign in the other.  Earl unhooks the
               clothes line and dumps it, clothes and all, into the back of
               their truck, on top of the rest of their belongings.

               They stare at each other for a moment.  This is it.  No going
               back.  They leap into the truck.  As they drive off, Val leans
               out and yanks their wooden nameplate ("E. Basset -- V. McKee")
               off the mailbox.


         18    EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    18

               They haven't gone fifty yards when they spot NANCY STERNGOOD
               (40s) working in front of her house.  The guys pull their
               hats low over their faces.  Earl swerves to the far side of
               the street.

                                          EARL
                            Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants
                            another load of firewood.

                                          VAL
                            Forget it, man.  It's not worth it.

               Nancy spots them and beckons excitedly.

                                          EARL
                            She's got us.  Now, listen, the
                            plan is: we have done our last job
                            in Perfection.

                                          VAL
                            That's the plan.

               They stop beside Nancy.  While they talk, Nancy's daughter,
               MINDY (9), comes bouncing along on her pogo-stick, listening
               to her Walkman and slowly circling the truck.

                                          NANCY
                            Mindy, honey, don't pogo in the
                            street.  Hey, guys, I've got a job
                            for you...

                                          EARL
                            Sorry, Nancy.  We ain't doing odd
                            jobs anymore.  We're headed for
                            Bixby permanent.

                            Oh, sure...
                                   (sees stuff in back of

                            ...My God, you really are!

                                          VAL
                            Yep, we're relocating to an area
                            with a greater economic base.
                                   (to Mindy, over her music)
                            Hey, Mindy, what's the count?

                                          MINDY
                            Six hundred three, six hundred
                            four, six hundred five...

                                          VAL
                            Go for it!

                                          NANCY
                            Gee, guys.  I made the big
                            decision.  I'm putting in that
                            satellite dish.  I was going to
                            offer you five hundred dollars.

               Val and Earl glance at each other -- five hundred dollars!


         19    EXT.  DESERT ROAD - PICK-UP TRUCK - DAY                      19

               The truck roars toward the "Leaving Perfection" sign.  Val
               and Earl are elated, downright giddy.

                                          EARL
                            We did it!  We faced temptation and
                            we did not bend!

                                          VAL
                            Damn straight!  Now there's nothing
                            between us and Bixby but nothing!

               They zoom past the sign.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Last time we'll see that sign!

               They laugh, then are thrown half out of their seats as Earl
               accidentally hits a big pothole.

                                          EARL
                            Last time we hit that goddamn
                            pothole!


         20    EXT.  DESERT - WIDE - DAY                                    20

               As the truck streaks across the landscape.  Val and Earl
               merrily continue their good-byes to whatever is visible.

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            So long, cactus!

                                          EARL (V.O.)
                            Adios, bridge!


         21    EXT.  CANYON ROAD - DAY                                      21

               On its way down from the high desert, the lonely road now
               winds through a twisting, narrow canyon.  A county highway
               maintenance truck is parked to one side and two road workers,
               CARMINE and HOWARD, repair a slide-damaged section of the
               road, Carmine breaking up asphalt with a jackhammer.  Val and
               Earl pull up, hand them each a beer, and speed away, shouting:

                                          VAL
                            Last time down this damn twisty
                            road!


         22    EXT.  SHACK - DAY                                            22

               The pick-up speeds past a small shack.  Val and Earl
               automatically roll up their windows.  In a moment we see why:
               a monster, ferocious dog comes galloping out to chase their
               truck.  Earl gives the dog the finger.

                                          EARL
                            Last chance, asshole.  Run, run...!


         23    EXT.  OLD FRED'S PLACE - DAY                                 23

               Old Fred latches the gate on his corral filled with sheep.
               He looks up as Val and Earl's truck speeds past.  Val and Earl
               honk their horn and wave happily.  Old Fred waves back.


         24    EXT.  ROAD - ELECTRICAL TOWERS - DAY                         24

               The pick-up zooms along, the road now paralleling a line of
               tall high-tension electrical towers.


         25    INT./EXT.  PICK-UP TRUCK - MOVING - DAY                      25

               The guys have calmed down, but each is still dreaming of a
               new life.

                                          EARL
                            Okay, here's the plan.  We bust our
                            tails in the car wash six months...
                            well, maybe nine...and we don't
                            spend a dime, you know?  And then
                            we go for it...down payment on a
                            tow-truck or a back-hoe or
                            something, right?  Start a real
                            business.  We can start looking for
                            something today, tonight!

               Val points up ahead -- a man is sitting near the top of a
               distant electrical tower.

                                          VAL
                            Jeez, look at that guy.

                                          EARL
                                   (shakes his head)
                            One job I'd never take is working
                            around electricity.

                                          VAL
                            Especially when it's two hundred
                            feet off the ground.

               But as the pass the tower:

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Hey, hold up...That's Edgar Deems!

                                          EARL
                            You're full of shit.

                                          VAL
                            He's only got one damn jacket.
                            That's him, I'm telling you.


         26    EXT.  ELECTRICAL TOWER - DAY                                 26

               Earl pulls over.  They climb out and peer up at the tower.
               Edgar is hard to see through the criss-crossing girders.

                                          EARL
                                   (impressed)
                            Man, oh, man.  He must've really
                            been drunk this time.
                                   (shouts)
                            Edgar!  What the hell you doing?
                            Get on down from there!

               Edgar doesn't move.  Val and Earl shift about uncomfortably.

                                          VAL
                            Well, shit, we can't leave him up
                            there.

               They stare at each other.  Someone's got to climb up.  Val
               raises his fist in The Challenge.  Their fingers fly.  Rock
               breaks scissors.  Val loses.

               Valentine unhappily climbs the tall tower while Earl watches
               from below.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Hey, Edgar, don't you move.  I'm
                            coming to get you...You damn fool,
                            you owe me on this one...

               Higher and higher Val climbs.  He tries not to look down.

               He's approaching Edgar from below and behind.  As he gets
               nearer he begins to notice forboding details: one of Edgar's
               shoes is missing, half the trouser led is torn off.. Edgar is
               strapped to a girder by his belt, his shotgun gripped in his
               hands.  A swarm of flies buzzes away.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            What the hell...

               He edges around to where he can see Edgar's face -- the
               eyes are wide open, staring.  He's dead.


         27    EXT.  OLD FRED'S PLACE - DAY                                 27

               Old Fred is now hoeing his garden.  He glances up as Val and
               Earl's pick-up roars back toward Perfection.


         28    EXT.  JIM AND MEGAN'S HOUSE - DAY                            28

               A big station wagon is parked between a small mobile home and
               a half-finished house being built by JIM and MEGAN WALLACE,
               an out-going, energetic older couple.  Lumber, cinder blocks,
               and tools are scattered around the yard.

               Jim examines Edgar's body in the bed of Val and Earl's pick-
               up truck.  Val, Earl and Megan talk in subdued tones.

                                          VAL
                            Real sorry to bother you, Megan,
                            but we figured since Jim's a doctor...

                                          MEGAN
                            No, it's fine.  You did the right
                            thing.  When Jim is done we'll call
                            the Coroner's office in Bixby.
                            We'll take care of it.
                                   (shakes her head)
                            Poor Edgar.

                                          EARL
                                   (tries to break the mood)
                            Well, I see you got all the
                            wallboard up.

                                          MEGAN
                            That was easy.  You two did the
                            hard part.  Sure sorry you're
                            leaving.

               Jim climbs out of the pick-up.

                                          EARL
                            Was is a heart attack?

                                          JIM
                                   (shaking his head)
                            He died of dehydration.  Thirst.

                                          VAL
                            But that doesn't make sense.  That
                            takes a couple of days, doesn't it?

                                          JIM
                            Three or four even.

                                          EARL
                            You mean he sat up there three or
                            four days?  Just sat there till he
                            died of thirst?

               Jim shrugs.  Everyone is mystified.


         29    EXT.  OLD FRED'S PLACE - DAY                                 29

               Fred is still hoeing.  In the nearby pen his sheep start
               acting restless.  He eyes them.  What's up?  We hear a
               strange muffled sound.  Unseen, behind him, at the far end of
               the garden, his scarecrow mysteriously tilts.

               Old Fred keeps hoeing.  He stops, his foot is caught in the
               dirt.  Suddenly he is yanked knee-deep into the ground!


         30    EXT.  CANYON ROAD - DAY                                      30

               Val and Earl's truck, again headed for Bixby, and going way
               too fast, zooms past the two workers still repairing the
               road.  The workers glance up, annoyed.


         31    EXT.  SHACK - DAY                                            31

               Val and Earl, sobered and deep in thought, drive past the
               shack where the ferocious dog lives.  They automatically roll
               up their windows during:

                                          EARL
                            Reckon he hated Perfection more
                            than us?  You suppose he wanted to
                            kill himself?

                                          VAL
                            If he did, why didn't he use his
                            damn shotgun?

                                          EARL
                            Maybe he just couldn't pull the
                            trigger...

                                          VAL
                            Oh sure, he figured it was easier
                            to die of thirst?  Come on,
                            sombody must've chased him up
                            there.

                                          EARL
                            Oh, you mean somebody who ain't
                            scared of a twelve gauge shotgun.
                            And then what did they do?  Camp
                            out down below and just wait for
                            him to die?

               Val has no answer.  It's too weird.

                                          VAL
                            Well, whatever the hell happened
                            it's just one more goddamn good
                            reason to haul ass out of this
                            place.

                                          EARL
                            You got that right.

               They are passing the shack.  Earl suddenly realizes:

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            Hey, where the hell's that asshole
                            dog?

                                          VAL
                                   (looking around)
                            Probably up a pole starving itself
                            to death.

                                          EARL
                            Okay, the plan is: pedal to the
                            metal the whole way.  We don't stop
                            till we hit the carwash, not even
                            to pee.

                                          VAL
                            I'll go with that plan.


         32    EXT.  OLD FRED'S PLACE - DAY                                 32

               CLOSE ON the pick-up's tires skidding to a stop.  PULL OUT to
               see we're back at Old Fred's.

                                          VAL
                            What are you doing?

               Earl is staring wide-eyed.  Val follows Earl's gaze and is
               aghast when he sees --

               The sheep pen -- it's a ghastly, bloody mess.  Scattered on
               the churned up ground a few dismembered sheep legs and heads
               are all that remain of the flock.

                                          VAL
                                   (whispers)
                            What the hell...?

               Val and Earl leap out of the truck to investigate.

                                          VAL
                            Hey, Old Fred!  Fred!  Where are
                            you?!

               Earl dashes into Fred's house.  Val checks around outside.
               Earl comes back out.

                                          EARL
                            Not here.

               Then they spot something lying in the middle of the garden --
               Old Fred's hat.

               Still looking all around, Val squats distractedly to pick up
               the hat.  He and Earl stumble backward in shock.

               OLD FRED IS STILL WEARING HIS HAT!!  His mangled face stares
               up at them, eyes and mouth frozen open in a death grimace.

                                          EARL
                            Oh, Jesus!!

                                          VAL
                            What the hell is going on?  I mean
                            WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?!!


         33    EXT. CANYON ROAD - DAY                                       33

               Carmine and Howard continue repairing the road, Carmine still
               using the noisy jackhammer.  Val and Earl drive up.

                                          EARL
                            You guys better get the hell outta
                            here!  We got a killer on the loose!

                                          HOWARD
                            What?

               Carmine stops jackhammering to listen.

                                          EARL
                            A murderer, man!  A real psycho.
                            He's cutting people's heads off!
                            I'm serious!  I'd high-tail for
                            town if I was you!

               Val and Earl speed away.

                                          CARMINE
                            They're drunk.

                                          HOWARD
                            Yeah...

               But he edges over to the truck and takes out a heavy steel
               pry-bar to keep within easy reach.

               Carmine goes back to work, pounding the asphalt with the
               jackhammer.  Suddenly the blade strikes something beneath the
               road, something soft.  We hear a strange, unearthly shriek
               from underground.  A weird orange goo gushes up around the
               blade.  Then the jackhammer takes off by itself like a
               harpoon stuck in a whale!  Carmine gets tangled in the jack-
               hammer's air-hose and is dragged along, shouting for help.

               Howard chases him down the embankment and into the scrub-
               brush.  He hears Carmine screaming.

                                          HOWARD
                            Carmine!  What the hell is it?!
                            Where are you?

               But now there is only silence.  Howard crashes through the
               brush.  All he finds is the torn end of the air-hose -- which
               suddenly sucks down into the ground.  He's momentarily
               staggered by an awful smell, but forces himself to keep
               looking.  He lets the pry-bar drag on the ground.  Then
               something -- it looks like a mouth or a horrid beak -- shoots
               out of the ground and grips the pry-bar with uncanny
               strength!  Howard drops his weapon and scrambles madly away.

               He clambers back onto the road.  But almost immediately
               cracks form in the pavement around him.  More beak-things
               break through the asphalt between him and his truck.

               He dashes across the road, scrambling up the embankment.  He
               clings precariously to a tree root, looking down -- where'd
               they go?  Suddenly the dirt around him begins to "bubble."
               Several hungry beaks break through and grab him, yanking him
               head first into the embankment.  Then the embankment gives
               way, crashing down onto the road, taking with it a nearby
               telephone pole and snapping the lines.


         34    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 34

               Pham Van is talking to MIGUEL, a local rancher.  They both
               jump as the doors burst open.  Val and Earl race in, trailed
               by Nestor and Melvin.  Val heads for the payphone during:

                                          NESTOR
                            His head?  You mean just his head?

               Val grabs the phone and digs in his pocket for change.

                                          VAL
                            Yeah, really sick, man.  Sweet Old
                            Fred.

               Earl comes up with change and hands it to Val, who dials.

                                          PHAM VAN
                            Something happen to Fred?

                                          MELVIN
                                   (ignoring Pham)
                            Are you serious, man?  They killed
                            him just to take his sheep?

                                          EARL
                            He didn't have nothing else to
                            steal.  Neither did Edgar.

                                          MIGUEL
                            What happened to Edgar?

               Val stares at the phone.

                                          VAL
                            I don't believe this.  The phone is
                            out!  Pham, your phone is out!

                                          PHAM VAN
                            I didn't do it!  What's going on?

               Val and Earl rush out.


         35    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 35

               Trailed by the others Val and Earl march out and leap into
               their truck , Val driving now.  He searches for the key.

                                          NESTOR
                            We've gotta get the police up here.
                            You guys gotta step on it to Bixby.

               Earl hands Val the key.

                                          VAL
                            Consider it stepped on.


         36    EXT.  CANYON ROAD - DAY                                      36

               Again the pick-up barrels through the canyon.

                                          VAL
                            Brother, we decided to leave this
                            place just one day too late, you
                            know?

                                          EARL
                                   (grimly)
                            Well, there's sure as hell nothing
                            to stop us now.  Everybody we know
                            between here and Bixby is already
                            dead.

               Earl points ahead and screams:

                                          EARL
                            LOOK OUT!!

               Val brings the truck to a squealing stop.  Ahead: the
               collapsed embankment completely blocks the road.  It's
               totally impassable.  The cowboys are dumbfounded.

                                          EARL
                            Is some higher force at work, here?
                            Are we asking too much of life?

               But Val is in no mood for philosophy.  He leaps out and peers
               into the highway maintenance truck which sits undisturbed,
               emergency lights still flashing.  There's nobody in it.  He
               starts looking around.

                                          VAL
                            Those assholes are supposed to be
                            fixing the goddamn road!
                                   (shouts)
                            Hey!  Where are you guys?  People
                            gotta use this road, you know!
                            You on a booze break or what?!

                                          EARL
                                   (whispers; urgently pointing)
                            Val!  Val!

               Val looks where he's pointing -- Howard's bloodstained
               hardhat lies at the edge of the landslide.  Val gets the
               point.  Looking around for the unknown assailant, he eases
               back into the truck.  Earl already has a pistol in his lap
               and is digging through the glove compartment.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            Where are the bullets?  Don't we
                            have any goddamn bullets?

               Val quickly jockeys the truck to turn it around on the narrow
               road.  But as he backs into the hillside, we hear a strange
               grating clunk from underneath.  When he tries to pull
               forward, the truck won't move.  The engine stalls.

                                          VAL
                            Jesus!  I don't believe this!

                                          EARL
                            You're hung up again.

                                          VAL
                            I am not!

               They both lean out.  The rear tires are clear.  Val restarts
               the truck and tries to pull forward, rocking the truck
               against some unseen pull.  Smoke wells up from the clutch.

                                          EARL
                            You're hung up I tell you.  You're
                            gonna burn the clutch.

               Val slams the truck into low-range four-wheel-drive and revs
               it.  The tires dig in, fighting for traction -- and suddenly
               the truck lurches free.  We hear an eerie shriek mingled with
               gear and engine noise as Val angrily roars away.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            Jesus, you can break an axle like
                            that.

                                          VAL
                            Fuck you!

                                          EARL
                            Hey, I don't want spend the night
                            out here!


         37    EXT.  PHAN VAM'S STORE - DAY                                 37

               The word has spread.  Everybody in town is gathered at Pham
               Van's.  They rush out to meet Val and Earl as they drive up.

                                          BURT
                            What the hell you doing back
                            already?

                                          VAL
                            You're never going to believe this,
                            but the canyon road...we were on it
                            not two hours ago...well, it's
                            completely...

               But he stops because they're all staring wide-eyed at the
               rear of the truck.

                                          NANCY
                            My God...!

               Val and Earl jump out and look where everyone else is
               looking.  Their jaws drop.  REVEAL: hanging from the rear
               axle of their truck and trailing out behind like a nightmare
               wedding decoration -- a sex foot long, grotesque, fleshy,
               tentacle.  The end gripping the axle looks like a vicious,
               razor-sharp beak or hook.  The trailing end is mutilated,
               oozing orange goo -- as though the creature was torn in half.

               Burt, more daring than the others, pries the thing off the
               axle with a shovel.

                            Damn right fifteen.

               Burt is deep in thought.

                                          BURT
                            Just one of these couldn't eat up
                            off a whole flock of sheep.
                            There's gotta be more out there, a
                            lot more.

               A cold chill spreads through the group.  They stare out at
               the vast, forbidding desert.  They suddenly feel alone --
               very alone.


         38    EXT.  DESERT - DAY                                           38

               CLOSE on Rhonda's hat lying on the ground.  We think the
               worst.  Then she reaches in, picks it up and puts it on.
               REVEAL she's in a lonely corner of the valley working with a
               seismograph.  She pounds a marking stake into the dirt.


         39    INSERT - CLOSE ON SEISMOGRAPH                                39

               The needle responds to each blow on the stake.  We hear
               Rhonda stop pounding.  The needle stops.  All is silent --
               but the needle starts moving again!"


         40    BACK TO SCENE                                                40

               LOW CAMERA is MOVING in Rhonda's general direction.  She
               starts to pound another stake.  CAMERA REACTS so it is moving
               straight toward her.  As it passes a burrow, a rabbit
               suddenly scouts out.  CAMERA WHIP PANS to watch the rabbit
               scamper into the distance, then TURNS BACK to move toward
               Rhonda, who still pounding her stake.

               CAMERA passes Rhonda's seismograph.  The machine tilts
               slightly as the ground bulges up beneath it.

               Rhonda finishes pounding.  She heads for her truck, noisily
               tossing in her tools and slamming the tailgate.  CAMERA
               CLOSES IN on her, faster and faster.  It is right on her
               heels as she climbs into the cab!


         41    ANGLE - RHONDA'S TRUCK                                       41

               A beak-thing thrusts out of the ground, groping where
               Rhonda's boot just was.  Rhonda drives off, unknowingly
               running right over the thing.  We hear a shriek of pain as
               the tentacle writhes and sucks back under the ground.


         42    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - NIGHT                               42

               Mindy Sterngood poses cautiously with the bizarre hook
               tentacle.   A camera FLASHES and we REVEAL Pham Van taking
               her photo beside a sign: "Photographs -- You and the Snake
               Monster -- $2.00."  Viola and Miguel, wait in line.

               We now see the store is crowded with concerned townsfolk
               debating what to do, and how to protect themselves.  Val and
               Earl sit on the sidelines, sipping beer, gazing in awe at
               enterprising Phan Vam:

                            A man who plans ahead.

               Dominating the discussion are Burt and Heather now armed with
               scoped, magnum hunting rifles.  Heather stands guard at a
               window, peering out into the night.

               Burt steps over to a faded topographic map on the wall and
               points out details during:

         43    EXT.  JIM AND MEGANS'S HOUSE - ESTABLISH - NIGHT             43

               In the vast desert night a single floodlight illuminates Jim
               and Megan's partially finished house.  Their station wagon is
               parked out front.  A country and western tune drifts to us
               from it's radio.

               As we MOVE CLOSER, we see the floodlight is powered by a
               small, softly purring generator set maybe fifty feet away.

               Jim and Megan, both exhausted, unload a big stack of roofing
               shingles from their station wagon.  Jim starts to lift a
               package of shingles but gives up and sits on the tailgate.

                                          JIM

                            We have to go into Bixby in the
                            morning.
                                   (grins devilishly)
                            The concrete blocks are in.

                                          JIM
                            The con...!  Oh my God.

                                          MEGAN
                            Just keep looking at that beautiful
                            sky.

                                          JIM
                            What?

                                          MEGAN
                            That's the sky that's going to be
                            over our roof every night, when
                            we're done.

                                          JIM
                                   (joking)
                            Ah, but consider this, if we don't
                            finish the roof, we can looks at
                            that sky all the time.

               Just then the whirring of the generator becomes strangely
               muffled.  The floodlight flickers.  Now the generator dies.
               Darkness engulfs them.  The car radio music drones on
               incongruously.

                                          JIM (cont'd)
                            Damn that thing!

                            We could always buy a new
                            generator.

               Jim digs out a powerful flashlight and heads over toward the
               generator.  Megan lies back, taking a welcome breather.
               After a moment:

                                          MEGAN
                            Well, what's wrong with it?

                                          JIM (V.O.)
                            It's...gone...!


         44    ANGLE - JIM                                                  44

               Baffled, he sweeps the whole area with the flashlight.  Megan
               joins him.

                                          MEGAN
                            You sure this is where it was?

                                          JIM
                            Am I sure?!
                                   (points with flashlight)
                            It was right there.  There's the
                            cord.

               The severed electric cable stops at the edge of a cone-shaped
               depression in the dirt where the generator sat.  He hands her
               the flashlight and kneels.  We watch tensely as he probes the
               loose earth with his hands.

                                          JIM (cont'd)
                            Maybe the ground caved in.  There's
                            a lot of old mines and stuff around
                            here.

               Megan grabs his shirt, trying to pull him back.

                                          MEGAN
                            Well don't then!  You don't want to
                            fall in.

               Suddenly, about ten feet away -- WHOOMP!!  The generator
               shoots up out of the ground!  Jim and Megan dive for cover as
               it sails through the air, and crashes to earth.  They stare,
               transfixed.  The generator is dented and bent almost beyond
               recognition -- and covered with oozing slime.

                                          JIM
                            What the...?

               But Megan is all action.  She yanks him back.

                                          MEGAN
                            Come on.  Get away from it!

                                          JIM
                            God, what a stink!

               We again hear that mysterious rumbling sound.  Jim stops,
               sweeping the flashlight around them.

                                          JIM (cont'd)
                            Hear that?

                                          MEGAN
                            Never mind!  Let's go!  Let's just
                            go into town or something!  Jim,
                            please!

               She hustles him bodily toward the car during:

                                          JIM
                            You know, I bet it's geological or
                            something, like natural gas, or a
                            geyser.  They stink like that.
                            Remember in Yellowstone...?

               Suddenly he drops knee-deep into ground!  Megan is thrown
               off balance and tumbles to one side.  The flashlight falls,
               lighting them at an eerie low angle.

                                          JIM (cont'd)
                            Something's got me!!

               We hear sickening CRUNCHES from below the earth.  He SCREAMS
               in excruciating agony.

                                          JIM (cont'd)
                            Oh, God!  Get me Out!!  GET ME OUT!!

               He struggles wildly, but just sinks further down!  Megan
               slides a 2X4 over to Jim.  He grabs it like a drowning man,
               trying to keep himself from being pulled down.  But he's
               pulled with suck power the 2X4 snaps!

               His head is going under.  Megan desperately tries to dig the
               smothering earth away, but she's losing.  Now only his arms
               are above ground.  She pulls with all her might, but he sinks
               inexorably down, down.  She's pulled flat on the ground.
               He's gone.

               The next instant, a vicious hook-tentacle erupts through the
               earth, missing Megan's face by inches.  She scrambles back
               frantically.


         45    ANGLE - STATION WAGON                                        45

               LOW CAMERA pursues Megan toward the car, just missing her as
               she dives in through the open tailgate.  She slams it after
               her.  The talons rake across the car, scratching the glass.

               Megan tumbles into the front seat.  Thank God the keys are in
               the ignition.  She starts the engine.  But outside the "snake
               things" attack the car in a frenzy, slashing blindly.  A rear
               tire is totally shredded just as:

               Megan floors it.  The car lurches forward but the mutilated
               tire falls apart.  The wheel rim digs into the loose earth
               and the car is stuck.  With no other recourse, Megan locks
               the door, rolls up the windows and cowers in the middle of
               the car, panting, sobbing.  The radio is still playing a
               happy cowboy tune.  She peeks out.  They gave up?  She's
               safe?  Nothing happens for a moment, then --

               The car starts to shake and shudder!  Dust wells up around the
               windows.

               Outside we see a bizarre sight.  The earth around the rear of
               the car is "boiling," dirt flying in all directions -- and
               the car starts to sink into the ground!!

               Megan wildly honks the horn!  The car looks just like a ship
               going down by the stern, hood tilting up gracefully.  The
               back windows shatter, dirt pouring in!  Megan smashes the
               windshield with a small fire extinguisher and scrambles out
               on the hood.  But there's no hope.  The car keeps sinking,
               titling now almost ninety degrees, forcing her onto a
               precarious perch on the grille -- sinking, sinking.

               Out of her mind with terror, she keeps softly murmuring the
               same hopeless phrases:

                                          MEGAN
                            Stop it!  Stop it!  Somebody stop it...!


         46    EXT.  DESERT - JIM AND MEGAN'S HOUSE - VERY WIDE - NIGHT     46

               The headlights are two ironic beacons sending their beams
               skyward through the roiling dust into the night sky.  The
               sound of the radio becomes muffled.  The headlights sink from
               view -- and then Megan's scream floats across the desert.


         47    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAWN                                47

               Out front of Pham Van's, nervous Val and Earl saddle up the
               horses while Pham loads their saddle bags with food.  Every-
               one has gathered to see them off.  There's an air of tension.

                                          VAL
                                   (eyeing the horses)
                            Pham, we don't want to be stuck on
                            a couple of canners.  They better
                            be fast.

                                          EARL
                            Relax.  A snake thing like that
                            couldn't move too quick.

                                          VAL
                            Screw you.  For all you know they
                            could fly.

               Earl pulls their old Smith and Wesson revolver and battered
               Winchester rifle out of the pick-up truck.

                                          EARL
                            You want the rifle or the Smith?

                                          VAL
                                   (definite)
                            The rifle.

               So does Earl.  He raises his hand.  They swiftly do a round
               of scissors-rock-paper.  Earl loses.  He hands Val the rifle.
               Just then, Burt and Heather pull up in their Blazer, climbing
               out with their hunting rifles.

                                          BURT
                            You guys all set?

                                          EARL
                            Ready as we'll ever be.

                                          BURT
                            Heather and I are going to drive
                            around a little, see if we can find
                            that college girl and tell her to
                            get her ass back into town.

                                          VAL
                            Good idea.  And we'll swing by the
                            doctor's place.  They were going to
                            go into Bixby but we don't know if
                            they left before the road was out.

               Val and Earl mount up.

                                          HEATHER
                            Hold on.  You guys oughta take
                            something that packs more punch
                            than that thirty-thirty.  Take one
                            of our Browning autos, or even my
                            model seventy...
                                   (offers her hunting rifle)
                            It's three-seventy-five H and H
                            mag.

               Earl takes the awesome-looking gun with a smug glance at Val.

                                          EARL
                            Gee...thanks, Heather.  Hope we
                            don't need it.

               Heather unhooks a box of cartridges from her belt and hands
               it to Earl.  Suddenly there's a blood-curdling SCREAM!  The
               door to Pham Van's flies open.  Out staggers Melvin, wrapped
               in Pham Van's hook-tentacle, writhing in apparent agony.

                                          MELVIN
                            IT'S GOT ME!  IT's GOT ME!  AAAAHGH!

               People scatter like sheep.  Burt and Heather have guns
               trained on him in an instant.  Then everyone realizes it's a
               sick joke.  Melvin collapses with laughter.  Burt is livid.
               He almost shot Melvin.  He charges over and yanks the kid to
               his feet, screaming:

                                          BURT
                            You stupid punk!  You came that
                            close, that close!!

                                          EARL
                            One of these days, Melvin,
                            somebody's gonna kick your ass.

               Pham rushes over and grabs his precious tentacle.  As people
               calm down, Val and Earl gaze nervously at the vast desert
               before them.

                                          BURT
                            Well...you fellas watch yourselves.

                                          NANCY
                            Come back with the Sheriff.

                                          NESTOR
                            Sheriff, like hell.  Come back with
                            the National Guard.

               They ride out to an adlib chorus:  "Keep your heads down;"
               "Go careful, boys;" "Keep a sharp lookout;" etc.


         48    EXT.  DESERT - DAY                                           48

               Val and Earl ride along, very tiny in the vast, lonely
               landscape, and very on edge.  Constantly looking all around.

                                          EARL
                            You know, we can't possibly make
                            Bixby by nightfall.

               Val doesn't want to hear it.

                                          EARL
                            That means we're gonna be out here,
                            like, in the dark.

                                          VAL
                                   (resentfully)
                            Great.  Thank you.

               Faint Country and Western radio music drifts to them.
               They're nearing Jim and Megan's house.


         49    EXT.  JIM AND MEGAN'S HOUSE - DAY                            49

               Val knocks on the door to the mobile home.

                                          VAL
                            Hey, doctor, anybody here?

               No answer.  He opens the door and peers inside.  Behind him
               Earl steps out of the half-finished house and shrugs.  Nobody
               around.  Wind rustles the plastic sheeting over the windows.
               Strangely they can still hear the muffled radio clearly.

                                          VAL
                                   (spooked)
                            Oh, man, I hate this shit.

               They walk briskly to their horses.  Earl snatches Heather's
               rifle from its saddle scabbard.  Val pulls out the
               Winchester.  Earl tries to reassure himself.

                                          EARL
                            Car's gone.  We just missed them,
                            that's all.

                                          VAL
                            Then where's the goddamn Conway
                            Twitty coming from?

               They focus on the sound and walk gingerly toward it, keeping
               constant watch in every direction.  The ground here is all
               torn up like the sheep pen -- and the music is coming from
               underneath!  What the hell is going on?

               Val scrapes at the dirt with his boot -- and finds the
               headlight of Jim and Megan's station wagon, still on, glaring
               up at him.  He drops down and wildly sweeps away more dirt,
               revealing more of the car's grille and hood -- and blood -
               soaked dirt which sticks to his hand.  He leaps away,
               frantically rubbing the blood off on his pants.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Oh, man...oh, man...


         50    EXT.  DESERT - CONCRETE DITCH - DAY                          50

               Val and Earl are riding at full gallop.  They race alongside
               a concrete-lined flood-control ditch and veer off to follow a
               barbed wire fence which crosses the ditch.


         51    EXT.  DESERT - BARBED WIRE FENCE - DAY                       51

               They ride along the fence during:

                                          EARL
                            Here's the plan...We don't even
                            stop.  Ride like hell.  Tonight we
                            keep right on going.  We'll walk
                            the horses.

                                          VAL
                            That is the plan...I mean, goddamn
                            it!  What the hell are those
                            things?  How could they bury an
                            entire Plymouth station wagon?

                                          EARL
                            Why would they do it?

               Suddenly the horses stop short.  In a frenzy they wheel
               around, rear up, refusing to go on.  The cowboys fight to
               control them.

                                          VAL
                            I knew it!  Pham Van wouldn't know
                            a decent horse if...!

               But Earl's already drawing his rifle.

                                          EARL
                            Shut up!  They got wind of
                            something they don't like!

                                          VAL
                            Oh shit!

               He draws his rifle.  They look wildly in all directions at
               once -- but there's nothing, only empty desert.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            But I don't see anything!

               They keep staring.  The horses keep pacing nervously.  Then
               -- Earl's horse rears wildly and falls!  Earl goes flying.
               Val wheels around wildly, dismounts and runs to Earl, who's
               bruised and winded but basically unhurt.  They think Earl's
               horse just tripped.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Hey, you okay?  You okay?

                                          EARL
                            Yeah...yeah.
                                   (turning to the horse)
                            What about the hor...?

               Their eyes bulge.  Several "snake things" have engulfed the
               horse's head, sucking, crushing, slurping.  Val's horse goes
               berserk and gallops for the horizon.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            What in the name...?

                                          VAL
                            That's how they get you!  They're
                            under the goddamn ground!

               Suddenly they realize what that means -- the thing could
               come up under them!!  The cowboys scramble frantically away.
               But nothing pursues them.  They pause, glancing back
               nervously.

                                          EARL
                            What the hell are they?

                                          VAL
                            Sons of bitches!

               Val raises his rifle and takes a well-aimed shot, hitting one
               of them.  Orange goo spurts out.  We hear a deafening shriek
               as all the "snake things" instantly zip back underground.

               Then -- A HUGE MOUND OF EARTH RISES UP UNDER VAL AND EARL!!
               The cowboys tumble down its side, Val losing his rifle.  They
               roll over and stare dumbfounded at the mound.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                                   (gasps)
                            There must be a million of them!!

               The mound of earth turns toward them.  The ground splits open
               and out rises -- a huge head!

                                          EARL
                                   (awestruck)
                            Nope...just one.

               The monster is a horrendous thirty-foot long eating machine!
               Its head is eyeless, utterly alien, covered with tough boney
               plates which close together to form a cork-screw point.

               The cowboys stumble back toward the fence in speechless
               terror.  The creature slides toward them, pushing through the
               earth like a whale through water.  Now it opens its mouth --
               but it's like a grotesque flower, boney plates spreading open
               like petals, revealing a huge, slimy, fleshy, oozing orifice!
               And inside the mouth, a ghastly multi-tentacled tongue!
               These are the "snake things," not snakes at all but actually
               the horrid hook-tentacles that can shoot out six feet to snag
               their prey!

               The monster snorts and snuffs, throwing up plumes of dust,
               sounding like a horrendous pig.  It sinks into the earth and
               charges!  We see the hump of earth move toward them faster
               and faster but then it disappears as the creature goes deeper.

               Val and Earl leap sideways and run along the fence.  The
               creature goes straight and slams into a fencepost from below.
               All we see is the fencepost knocked at a crazy angle.

               The cowboys keep running.  The creature regroups and charges
               after them, hitting each fencepost in turn, sending weird
               sinuous shock waves along the barbed wire, making almost
               musical twanging sounds.  Val looks back.

                                          VAL
                            It's gaining on us!!

               And as if that weren't enough, Earl points to more trouble
               ahead.


         52    EXT.   CONCRETE DITCH - DAY                                  52

               The fence runs straight to the edge of the ditch, an eight
               foot wide gap yawning dead ahead.  The creature churns like
               a locomotive from behind.  They'll have to try to jump!  They
               strain desperately for every last fraction of speed.

                                          EARL
                            We can do it, we can do it!

               They leap and -- they don't do it!!  They smack into the
               opposite side of the ditch, clawing frantically at the lip,
               only to tumble to its sloping bottom.  A split second later
               the charging creature slams like a wrecking ball into the
               foot-thick concrete wall!  The wall CRACKS AND BULGES OUT!  A
               hook-tentacle flops out through one of the cracks!  Terrified
               Val and Earl scramble away.  But the wall holds together.

               And the, strangely, all is quiet.  The tentacle lays dead
               still.  Eventually, the cowering cowboys dare to creep back a
               little closer, still panting, exhausted, jumpy.

                                          EARL
                            Stupid son of a bitch...knocked
                            itself cold.

               And now orange slime begins to ooze through the cracks in the
               concrete.

                                          VAL
                            Cold, my ass!  It's dead!  We
                            killed the bastard!

               He suddenly shakes his fist at the dead beast.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            You FUCKER!!

               They allow themselves a small wheeze of nervous laughter,
               only to jump like rabbits as some pebbles rattle loudly down
               the concrete wall behind them.  They whirl to see Rhonda, up
               on the opposite side of the ditch, staring down at them.
               She's lugging a bunch of her equipment, including a small
               folding shovel.

                                          RHONDA
                            Hi, guys, how're you doing?  Look,
                            can I ask you something?  Did you
                            just notice something weird?
                            Vibrations?  You know, some kind of
                            earth tremor?

               Val and Earl look at each other, then burst out laughing.
               Rhonda spots the cracked wall.

                                          RHONDA (cont'd)
                            What's that?


         53    EXT.   CONCRETE DITCH - DAY                                  53

               The shattered concrete has been pulled away to fully reveal
               the creature's horrendous head.  Start CLOSE on it: oozing
               blood, slavering mouth plates hanging open, hook-tentacles
               lolling out.  WIDEN to see Earl and Rhonda, sweating, dusty
               and tired, staring in awe and cringing at the stench.

                                          EARL
                            Jesus Christ...think it smells like
                            that 'cause it's dead?

                                          RHONDA
                            I don't see any eyes...must be
                            totally subterranean...and those
                            tentacles...

                                          EARL
                            I think they shoot right outta its
                            mouth, hook you, and pull you right
                            in.  Good thing we stopped it
                            before it killed anybody else.

                                          RHONDA
                                   (shudders)
                            Yeah, I'm lucky it didn't find me.
                                   (overwhelmed)
                            This is important, you know.  This
                            is like, well, let's say it, it's
                            probably the biggest zoological
                            discovery of the century.  The
                            century?  Forget it.  History.

               We can hear a shovel digging up above, and now Val shouts:

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            I got it!  Here's the other end!
                            Just look at what we caught here!

               Earl and Rhonda climb up.  CRANE UP with them to REVEAL the
               whole animal!  Val, digging excitedly with Rhonda's shovel,
               is just scraping away the last loose dirt from the creature's
               tail.  The whole length of the immense thirty foot beast is
               partially uncovered, in king-sized bas-relief.

                                          EARL
                                   (hushed)
                            This is one big mother!

                                          VAL
                            So this is the guy that had your
                            seismos working overtime?

               She nods, stepping down to study the creature.  The body is
               stream-lined, cigar-shaped, maybe eight feet in diameter at
               its thickest.  It's covered with hundreds of short, rear-
               pointing, retractable spikes.  Rhonda gingerly jiggles one.
               It can be pushed in and out of its socket like a plunger.

                                          RHONDA (cont'd)
                            It must push itself along with
                            these.  Hundreds of them pushing at
                            once.  That's how it can move so
                            fast.  I mean this thing was
                            tripping sensors all over the
                            valley.  No wonder I couldn't...

               A chilling thought stops her in mid-sentence.  She springs
               down into the drainage ditch to get her backpack, pulling out
               her seismograph printouts.  She studies them frantically
               during:

                                          EARL
                            Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of
                            anything like this before?

                                          VAL
                                   (elbows Earl)
                            Sure, Earl, everybody knows about
                            them.  We just didn't tell you.
                            Come on, nobody's ever seen one of
                            these!  We're really in on
                            something here!

               The guys looks at each other.  One thought immediately springs
               to their minds.

                                          EARL
                            Pham Van don't get his mitts on
                            this for no measly fifteen bucks!

                                          VAL
                            You got that right!

               While they bask in their fame-to-be, Rhonda continues to
               study the print-outs, coming to a terrifying conclusion.

                                          EARL
                            Here's the plan: we'll get a...a
                            flatbed, I guess, with a big winch,
                            figure a five ton anyway.

                                          VAL
                            Naw, don't want to winch it.  That'd
                            tear it all up.  Want to lift it.
                            Some kind of crane with lifting
                            straps.

               But Rhonda interrupts -- now really scared.

                                          RHONDA
                            Hey, hey, shut up!  The way I
                            figure it.  There are five more of
                            these things!

               Val and Earl shut right up.  Earl edges up a fencepost.  Val
               sidles up onto a rock during:

                                          EARL
                            Five more?

               Rhonda paws through her unwieldy printouts, pointing out
               jagged ink lines on the graphs, comparing different ones.

                                          RHONDA
                            Yeah, darn it, look.  I've got
                            seismographs all over the valley.
                            If you compare the different
                            readings, there have to be five.
                            Here's one at two o'clock
                            yesterday, but here's another one
                            three miles away at the same time.
                            So that's two.  Now, here...

               The men leap from their perches and hustle her in the
               direction she came from.

                                          VAL
                            We'll take your word for it.

                                          EARL
                            Yeah.  Where's your truck?

                                          RHONDA
                            The other side of that dome.

               She indicates what to most of us would be a hill, dotted with
               huge boulders thrusting out of the sandy desert soil like big
               mushrooms.  The trio jogs toward the hill.


         54    EXT.  DESERT - SEISMOGRAPH - DAY                             54

               En route to the truck, they pass near one of Rhonda's
               seismographs.  Suddenly Earl stumbles as one leg drops knee-
               deep into the ground!  He screams.  Val wheels and bodily
               yanks him up.  They back away from the small hole in the
               ground, calming a little as they realize:

                                          EARL
                            Prairie dog burrow...

                                          VAL
                            Little sons of bitches.

               Rhonda tenses as she hears a sound she knows well -- the soft
               scratching of the seismograph needle across its paper
               cylinder.  She whacks Val on the shoulder and points
               speechlessly at it.


         55    INSERT - SEISMOGRAPH                                         55

               The needle is going wild!!


         56    BACK TO SCENE                                                56

               She doesn't have to explain.  All three of them dash dash for:


         57    EXT.  BOULDER FIELD - DAY                                    57

               The remains of an old rail fence lay beside one of the
               boulders.  Val, Earl, and Rhonda scramble over the wood, up
               onto the rock and stand there tensely.

               In a moment, the creature gently rustles the earth at the
               base of the rock.  The monster's slimy hook-tentacles slither
               out, searching the rock base.  Shuddering, the humans move as
               high as they can, well out of reach.  The tentacles slip back
               beneath the earth.  Everyone breathes a sigh of relief.

                                          EARL
                            Well, at least the bastard can't
                            climb.  Pardon my French.

                                          RHONDA
                            Probably couldn't move too easily
                            on the surface.

                                          VAL
                            God, the live ones smell worse tan
                            the dead ones.

                                          EARL
                            Okay, now, how far's your truck?

               Rhonda points.  They can see the roof of her truck, maybe a
               hundred yards away through the boulders.  Val and Earl think
               about it.

                                          VAL
                            I don't know.  If this one's any
                            faster than that other one...

                                          EARL
                                   (nods)
                            I think we wait right here.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:


         58    EXT.  BOULDER FIELD - SUNSET                                 58

               It's hours later.  Stiff and uncomfortable, they have nothing
               to do but theorize.

                                          RHONDA
                            There's nothing like them in the
                            fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so
                            they predate the fossil record...
                                   (not buying it herself)
                            That'd make them a couple of
                            billion years old...and we've just
                            never seen one till now.  Right.

                                          EARL
                            I'd vote for outer space.  No way
                            those are local boys.

                                          VAL
                                   (joking)
                            Atomic testing.  Or, no, bio-
                            engineering!  The government built
                            them, a big surprise in the next
                            war.

               There's a long pause.  Earl stares at the dirt around the rock.

                                          EARL
                            Well...haven't seen a sign for
                            hours.  Maybe it's long gone.

                                          VAL
                            Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a
                            little stroll and see?

                                          EARL
                            Fuck you, too.  Pardon my French.

                                          RHONDA
                            Well, we've got to do something.

               Val gets an idea.  He grabs a post from the dilapidated fence
               and cautiously slips down near the boulder's edge.

                                          EARL
                            Watch yourself!  It's got a good
                            six foot reach.

               Val nods.  Dead silence as he reaches way out with the post
               and scrapes it on the ground.  Almost instantly the creature
               roars up, grabbing the post in a flurry of flying dirt and
               lashing tentacles, nearly hooking Val's hand.  Val
               practically falls over himself scrambling back to safety.

                                          VAL
                            Son of a bitch!

                                          EARL
                            Son of a goddamned bitch!  Been
                            waiting there all this time.  How
                            the hell's it even know we're still
                            here?

                                          VAL
                            It's been listening to us.  It's
                            got no eyes.  It sure as hell can't
                            smell anything underground, so I
                            figure...

               Rhonda stares at Val, impressed.

                                          RHONDA
                            Of course!  It can sense the
                            slightest seismic vibration...hear
                            every move we make.  Especially on
                            this rock.  It's a perfect
                            conductor.

               They all settle back, having no idea what to do next.  Rhonda
               gazes out at the desert that surrounds them like an ocean.

                                          RHONDA (cont'd)
                            I always wanted to be stuck on a
                            desert island.  But somehow I
                            always imagined, you know, water.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               Our heroes are silhouetted against a huge, spectacular,
               desert night sky.  After a very long pause:

                                          EARL
                            You know, I hate to be crude, but
                            I'm gonna have to take care of some
                            business here.

                                          VAL
                                   (emphatic)
                            Me, too.

                                          RHONDA
                                   (just as emphatic)
                            Same here.

               The silhouettes shift, Val and Earl moving down one side of
               the rock, and Rhonda down the other.  We can no longer see
               them.  We just head zippers zipping down -- then soft sighs
               of relief from Val and Earl.  Then:

                                          RHONDA (V.O.)
                                   (softly)
                            Darn it!

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            You okay?

                                          RHONDA (V.O.)
                            Yeah.  But I'll tell you, if you
                            ever wanted proof God is a man,
                            this is it.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:


         59    EXT.  BOULDER FIELD - DAWN                                   59

               Rich orange sunlight creeps silently across the deathly still
               desert.  Earl is already awake.  Val is curled up without his
               jacket, shivering.  He wakes with a start.  Where the hell's
               his jacket?

               Rhonda wakes slowly.  She's surprised to find herself wrapped
               in Val's jacket.  Touched by his chivalry, she embarrassedly
               hands it to baffled Val.

                                          RHONDA
                            Thanks.

               Val glances at Earl, who looks away.  Who, me?

                                          VAL
                                   (to Rhonda)
                            No problem.  Anytime.

               Earl gropes through his pockets, coming up with only
               cigarettes.  Val fishes in his own pockets, finding only
               their lighter.  They exchange items and light up during:

                                          EARL
                            Well, folks, what's the plan?

                                          VAL
                            First let's see if Stumpy's still
                            out there.

               This time he tosses a piece of wood out onto the sand.  With
               soft rustling, a bulge forms in the earth, moves over to the
               wood, then subsides.  Rhonda starts looking around during:

                                          EARL
                            Don't he have a home to go to?

                                          VAL
                                   (grim)
                            Well, that's why Edgar never got
                            down off that tower.

                                          RHONDA
                            I might have an idea...

                                          EARL
                                   (ignoring her)
                            We're gonna have to come up with
                            some kind of plan or it's just
                            gonna wait us to death.

                                          RHONDA
                            Well, I was wondering if we
                            could...

                                          VAL
                            Well, let's just run for it.  We
                            outran that one yesterday, at least
                            on a sprint.

               Rhonda gives up on them.  She goes over and pulls a long
               cross rail from the fence during:

                                          EARL
                            Run for it?  Running's not a plan.
                            Running is what you do when the
                            plan fails.  You're not even trying
                            to come up with a plan!

                                          VAL
                            Well, it's not like we've got a
                            hell of a lot of options...

                                          RHONDA
                                   (interrupting)
                            You guys know how to pole vault?

               They watch in surprise as she hefts her pole, checks the
               balance, eyeballs the distance to the nearest boulder.  Then
               she charges between them, plants her pole and vaults smoothly
               over to the next boulder, maybe fifteen feet away.  The
               creature surfaces where her pole touched down, but too late
               -- a hook tentacle vainly sweeps the area, the disappears
               into the ground.  Val and Earl glance at each other,
               impressed.

                                          RHONDA (cont'd)
                            We just stay where it can't get
                            us...on these residual boulders.
                            My truck's parked right next to
                            one.

               Earl rushes to grab a couple more fence rails.

                                          EARL
                            Stay on those residual boulders!

               Val just stands staring across at Rhonda -- his horizons are
               broadening.  Earl stuffs a fence rail into his hands.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                                   (pointedly)
                            Tammy Lynn Baxter, she do a lot of
                            pole-vaulting?

               Earl takes a deep breath and goes for it, vaulting across to
               Rhonda.  Val follows.


         60    EXT.  BOULDER FIELD - WIDE SHOT - DAY                        60

               Through the shimmering heat in the distance we see the
               strange sight of the three figures vaulting from boulder to
               boulder.


         61    EXT.  BOULDER FIELD - RHONDA'S TRUCK - DAY                   61

               Val, Earl and Rhonda pole-vault their way toward the truck.
               Finally they're at the nearest boulder, but the truck is
               still ten feet away.

                                          VAL
                            Think it's still following us?

                                          RHONDA
                            Let's assume that it is.

                                          EARL
                            And once we hit that truck we gotta
                            go fast.  I say we all jump together.

               Rhonda and Val nod.  Rhonda grips her car keys in her teeth.

                                          RHONDA
                                   (through clenched teeth)
                            Ready?

                                          VAL
                            Yeah.  One, two, three...

               They all vault in unison, landing in the truck bed.  Rhonda
               scrambles up, slides open the cab's rear window, and begins
               wriggling through headfirst.

                                          EARL
                                   (whispers)
                            Come on, girl, it ain't gonna give
                            us much time...

               Dust explodes around the rear of the truck!  Hook-tentacles
               snake up on all sides, narrowly missing Val.  He and Earl
               grab whatever's handy, pounding at the tentacles with
               expensive instruments.

                                          VAL
                            GO!  GO!  GO!

               Rhonda's only half way through the cab window, still hanging
               headfirst into the cab.  She frantically starts the truck,
               dives down and punches the accelerator with her fist.

               As the truck roars away, one tentacles manages to tear off the
               the muffler.  The engine thunders like a tank.  Val and Earl
               sit back, sighing in relief, then react when they see
               Rhonda is driving upside down and blind.


         62    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 62

               Rhonda skids her noisy truck to a halt in front of Pham Van's.

                                          VAL
                            We better get everybody together.

               Val leaps out and jumps into his pick-up truck.  He searches
               for the key.

                                          EARL
                            You go north, I'll go south.

                                          VAL
                            Right.

               Val holds out his hand for the key.  Earl tosses it to him.
               Val drives off.  We FOLLOW Rhonda and Earl as they drive the
               other way, toward Viola's.

                                          EARL
                            I'll bet you're sorry the college
                            ever sent you up here.

                                          RHONDA
                            Well, I'm scared, but I'm not
                            sorry.

                                          EARL
                            You know, Val went to that college,
                            too.  For a whole year.  Couldn't
                            quite sit still for it, though.
                            Had too much vinegar in his system.
                            But once he settles down, forgets
                            this cowboy stuff, he'll be one in
                            a million.

               Rhonda sees straight through Earl's clumsy attempt at match-
               making.  She can't help but smile.  Earl grins sheepishly.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            All right, I'm about as subtle as
                            a donkey's ass.  Pardon my French.
                            I'm just saying the boy's got
                            potential, that's all.

               MOVE IN on Rhonda -- her and Val?


         63    INT. PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                  63

               Nestor, Viola, Nancy, and Miguel nervously crowd around Val,
               Earl, and Rhonda.  Viola holds her yappy dog which perio-
               dically snarls and snaps at people.  Pham Van is on his CB
               radio trying to contact Burt and Heather.

                                          MIGUEL
                            You serious, Val?  You think we're
                            not even safe here in town?

                                          VAL
                            Ask me that after you meet one.  I
                            think we should all get the hell
                            out while the getting's good.

                                          NESTOR
                            Why not just take a Number Ten pick
                            axe and give it one good whack...?

                                          VAL
                            Nestor, damn it, these things are
                            bigger than an Airstream trailer!

                                          NANCY
                            God, I've got to find Mindy.

               Nancy rushes out.

                                          EARL
                            Hey, Pham, where's Burt and Heather?

                                          PHAM VAN
                                   (hangs up CB)
                            Can't raise them.  I guess they're
                            still out there somewhere.

                                          RHONDA
                            If you've got a radio, why aren't
                            you calling somebody in Bixby?  The
                            police or...

                                          PHAM VAN
                            Can't reach outside the valley.
                            You know, because of the mountains.

                                          MIGUEL
                            Hey, Rhonda, what's the name you
                            call those things, huh?

                                          PHAM VAN
                            Where'd they come from?

                                          RHONDA
                            Huh?  I don't know.

                                          PHAM VAN
                            You're a scientist, right?

                                          VIOLA
                            You should have a theory at least.

                                          RHONDA
                            Look, these things are absolutely
                            unprecedented!

                                          NESTOR
                            Yeah, but where'd they come from?

                                          RHONDA
                                   (exasperated)
                            Where'd they come from?  Okay,
                            worms, probably in the Jurassic
                            period.  Cosmic radiation was much
                            higher then...so they mutated...and
                            they got so big they just sank
                            right into the ground and fell
                            asleep... But now continental drift
                            has brought them to the surface,
                            ready to be harvested by the
                            ancient alien meat growers who
                            planted them here.

               Everybody stares at her, then they smile, realizing she's
               pulling their legs.

                                          EARL
                            You're right, don't matter where
                            they come from.

                                          VAL
                            Right.  We need to be talking about
                            what we're gonna do.

                                          VIOLA
                            My goodness, Valentine, once they
                            see the road is out and the phone
                            lines are down, someone will be
                            along to look in on us.  Don't you
                            think?


         64    EXT.  CANYON ROAD - DAY                                      64

               We see the utility truck still parked near the landslide
               blocking the road.  REVEAL, on the far side, a telephone
               maintenance truck is now parked, emergency lights flashing --
               and nearby, amid phoneworkers' climbing and repair gear, two
               more hard hats lying on blood-soaked ground.


         65    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 65

               The crowd is still jabbering away.  Rhonda speak over them:

                                          RHONDA
                            No no no, they listen!  They can
                            sense the slightest vibration
                            through the ground.  That's how
                            they see!  That's how they hunt!

                                          MIGUEL
                            So, like we don't vibrate, right?
                            Maybe they won't even come to here,
                            huh?  Maybe they leave us alone.

               Val shakes his head, and marches over to the topographic map
               on the wall.

                                          VAL
                            They caught up with Edgar here.
                            They grabbed Old Fred here.  They
                            nailed the asshole dog here.  And the
                            doctor's place is here...

               The spots he indicates describe a line leading along the
               valley straight toward town.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            This valley's just one long
                            smorgasbord and if we don't haul
                            ass outta here we're the next
                            course.

               We hear an a eerie SHRIEK from outside.  Something shoots in
               through the window, striking Earl in the chest!!  Earl flails
               frantically at it -- but it's only Melvin's basketball.  We
               glimpse Melvin outside, doubled over with laughter.  Earl
               grabs the ball and hurls it viciously back, but Melvin easily
               dodges it.

                                          EARL
                            You little ass wipe!  You knock
                            that off or you're gonna be
                            shitting that basketball!  Pardon
                            my French.

                                          NESTOR
                                   (to Val)
                            Now, Val, let's assume they're as
                            dangerous as you say.  Where are we
                            going to go that's safer than right
                            here?

                                          VAL
                            Rhonda's got an idea about that.

                                          RHONDA
                            Yes, see, they move very easily
                            through the Pleistocene Alluvials...
                                   (off their blank looks)
                            ...the dirt...the loose soil that
                            makes up the valley floor.  But
                            they can't move through solid rock.
                            I think we should travel west to
                            the mountains.

                                          EARL
                            You know, up the jeep trail.

                                          RHONDA
                            The mountains are solid granite.
                            We'd be safe there, and we could
                            hike along them...all the way to
                            Bixby if we have to.


         66    EXT.  EDGE OF TOWN - DAY                                     66

               Nancy rushes back toward Pham Van's, still looking.

                                          NANCY
                            Mindy!  Mindy!


         67    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 67

               We're CLOSE on Melvin as he circles around the back of Pham
               Van's, bouncing his basketball, mischief in his eyes.  We can
               hear the townsfolk inside.

                                          VIOLA (V.O.)
                            No, Valentine, I'm not leaving my
                            place.

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            Well, it's gonna take us days to
                            get back with help.

                                          EARL (V.O.)
                            Doggone it, Viola, it's just plain
                            crazy to stay.

               Then, to Melvin's astonishment, the steady rhythm of his
               bouncing basketball suddenly stops.  The ball just goes flup
               and doesn't bounce back up to him.  He looks down.  No ball!
               Just swirling dust at his feet.


         68    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 68

               Everyone jumps as we once more hear an ear-shattering SHRIEK
               from Melvin.  Earl snarls and heads for the door, Val right
               behind them.

                                          EARL
                            I'm gonna kick his ass!

                                          VAL
                            I'm gonna help you.


         69    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 69

               Val and Earl are well ahead of the other townsfolk as they
               march around to the side of Pham Van's.  But where's Melvin?
               Nothing out here but the oppressive, hot desert silence.
               Then they hear a soft shuddering whimper -- from above.
               There's terrified Melvin, halfway up a telephone pole,
               clinging to it desperately.

               Val and Earl freeze in their tracks and glance at each
               other, realizing instantly what's up.  Without a word they
               leap desperately in opposite directions.  Like a breaching
               whale, a creature roars up through the earth right where they
               were standing, great mouth gaping open, slimy tentacles
               lashing in all directions.

               The townsfolk scatter, some heading for their homes,
               including Viola and Nestor.  Others scramble over each other
               as they pile back into Pham Van's.  The telephone pole
               shudders.  Melvin falls and scampers for the nearest hiding
               place, a corrugated tin storage shed near Pham Van's.


         70    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 70

               Val, Earl, Rhonda, Miguel, and Pham Van rush in.

                                          MIGUEL
                            Jesus Christ!  Man, you gut a gun?!

                                          PHAM VAN
                            Big as a house!  What are we gonna
                            do...?!

                                          RHONDA
                            Quiet!  QUIET!!

               Miguel and Pham shut up.  Then we hear something new -- the
               building itself creaking and groaning like a ship.  The
               liquor bottles behind Pham Van's bar vibrate and clink.  The
               creature is moving beneath the building.  The people freeze
               like mannequins.  Now we can hear its pig-like snorting.
               Pham Van and Miguel react as the awful smell percolates up
               through the floorboards.  Val signals them to keep quiet.
               Finally, the creaking stops.

               Rhonda addresses the group in an intense whisper:

                                          RHONDA
                            Remember...no noise.  No vibration.

               Everyone stands stock still -- and sweats.  But, then, slowly
               we become aware of a faint, yet oddly familiar sound.
               Squeak, squeak, squeak -- Mindy on her pogo stick!  They all
               scramble to the windows.


         71    EXT.  MAIN STREET - DAY                                      71

               There she is, alone in the vacant street, Walkman blaring in
               her ears, merrily bouncing along to a rock 'n' roll beat.


         72    ANGLE - PHAM VAN'S STORE                                     72

               Thoughts of personal safety vanish as the horrified people
               lean way out the doors and windows and shout with one voice:

                                          CROWD
                                   (ad lib)
                            MINDY!
                            Get off your pogo stick!
                            Get in here, girl!
                            Run, Mindy!


         73    ANGLE - MINDY                                                73

               She can't hear them over her Walkman.  A tell-tale puff of
               dust spurts up not fifty feet from her!


         74    ANGLE - PHAM VAN'S STORE                                     74

               Val sees Mindy has only seconds left!  He vaults straight out
               the window and charges toward her!  Right behind him comes
               Earl and Rhonda.


         75    ANGLE - NANCY                                                75

               As she rounds a corner at the opposite end of town.  She
               spots Mindy, then sees Val running.  She starts running.

                                          NANCY
                            Mindy!  Mindy!


         76    ANGLE - MINDY                                                76

               She's lazily bouncing in circles -- squeak, squeak, squeak.
               She goes wide-eyed as she rotates to see Val coming at her
               like a mad bull, arms outstretched.  The asphalt under her
               pogo stick cracks and --

               Val tackles her, both of them tumbling head over heels.  She
               scrambles up, rubbing her skinned elbow and yelling:

                                          MINDY
                            Oww!  Val, you hurt me...!

               Val claps his hand over her mouth.  She goes wide eyed as she
               sees: her pogo stick standing straight up in the cracked
               asphalt!  Then it is sucked down like so much spaghetti!

               Nancy rushes into frame, hugging Mindy.  Val signals her to
               be quiet.  They sit uneasily.  Where's the creature?
               Suddenly the pogo stick erupts out of the earth right in
               their midst!

               Val runs one way, Nancy and Mindy the other, heading up the
               street toward their house.  Val scrambles up onto his pick-up
               truck!  The creature rams the truck, rupturing a tire.  As it
               shakes the truck violently, Val spots Rhonda and Earl, now
               standing uncertainly halfway between him and Pham Van's.

                                          VAL
                            Go back, for chrissake!

               Rhonda and Earl hesitate.

                                          EARL
                            We gotta get him off there.  It'll
                            suck that truck down!

               But Earl now hears something behind them!  Down the street,
               a little wall of cinder blocks framing Viola's driveway
               suddenly topples over.

                                          EARL
                            Oh, Jesus.  Rhonda, another one!


         77    ANGLE - LOW CAMERA - RHONDA AND EARL                         77

               CAMERA charges toward them.  Earl swerves toward Pham Van's,
               but Rhonda is cut off!  She heads toward the next nearest
               haven:


         78    EXT.  STORAGE SHED - DAY                                     78

               The storage shed where Melvin is hiding.  It sits in a
               vacant, weed-choked lot.  Crashing through the weeds, Rhonda
               has almost reached the shed when she is suddenly brought up
               short and slams face down in a cloud of dust!

               She can't get up!!  Something's got her!  She's caught in an
               old rusted barbed wire fence, lying almost flat, hidden in
               the weeds.  Some strands have come loose and are curled up
               like vicious concertina wire.

               Barely has she taken this in when -- the ground caves in
               under her!  She rolls wildly to one side as hook-tentacles
               snake up, missing her by inches!  She keeps rolling-crawling-
               scrambling -- anything to get away from the awful maw -- but
               gets her legs hopelessly tangled in the barbed wire.  She
               freezes.  The creature feels around where she was.

               She calms herself, pulling gingerly at the wire, working
               tensely to free herself but --

               The creature's mouth slams shut on the fence.  Like a spider
               sensing something caught in its web, the monster knows it's
               on to something.  Its hook-tentacles shoot forward to snare
               three feet of fence, then the creature lunges up and out,
               swallowing that three feet in a big "gulp" and yanking Rhonda
               violently toward it!  She screams, pants ripped, legs slashed
               and bleeding!  GULP!  She's dragged even closer.


         79    EXT.  MAIN STREET - THE PICK-UP - DAY                        79

               The truck shakes and shimmies as Val's creature tries to pull
               it down.  Val sees that Rhonda's in trouble.  He searches
               frantically for a weapon -- and finds one -- a CHAIN SAW!  He
               leaps as far from the truck as he can and hits the ground
               running, yanking furiously on the saw's starter cord.


         80    EXT.  STORAGE SHED - DAY                                     80

               Rhonda is in a dead panic, thrashing helplessly in the barbed
               wire.  The beast takes another gulp of fence, wrenching her
               within inches of a probing hook-tentacle!  Suddenly we hear a
               nasty ROAR as Val's chain saw swings in, slicing the squirm-
               ing tentacle in half, spraying gore everywhere!  The creature
               unleashes an unearthly shriek, and the other tentacles
               recoil.  The severed one writhes like a beheaded snake.

               Val yanks off Rhonda's boots.

                                          VAL
                            Come on!  Outta your pants!

               She frantically claws at her belt.  But in mere seconds:

                                          RHONDA
                                   (pointing)
                            LOOK OUT!

               Tentacles snake out to regain their grip on the fence.  Val
               grabs the saw and starts slashing wildly, but this time the
               hook-tentacles snag it and wrench it from his grasp.  It
               slams to the ground, motor dying.  The monster readies itself
               for the lunge that will suck Rhonda in.  Val grabs her under
               the arms and pulls.  Rhonda wriggles wildly to get out of her
               wire enmeshed pants.

               The creature lunges!  Rhonda pulls free!  She and Val tumble
               backward.  The creature gets only a mouthful of Rhonda's jeans.

               The next instant the second creature explodes up through the
               ground right next to fallen Val and Rhonda!  They roll
               sideways, come up running, and sprint for Pham Van's along an
               old wooden sidewalk.


         81    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 81

               Earl flings open the front door.  Val and Rhonda race toward
               the porch.  Right on their heels the creature ripples the
               boards like an ocean wave!

                                          EARL
                            Come on!  Come on!  Don't look back!
                            Just run!  Run like screaming fuck!

               They dive through the open door of Pham Van's.  The rippling
               boards zoom on past it.  Earl quickly eases the door shut.


         82    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 82

               Earl turns to breathless Rhonda.

                                          EARL
                                   (whispers)
                            Pardon my French.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:


         83    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - LATER                               83

               It's a tense, edgy group.  Every movement made is in slow
               motion, every word is a whisper.   They gaze grimly out the
               windows at the silent, deserted, heat-shimmering main street.

               Val gingerly dabs iodine onto the cuts on Rhonda's legs.
               She doesn't even wince.

                                          VAL
                            You paying attention?  This oughta
                            hurt like hell.

                                          RHONDA
                            It does.

               She smiles at him.

                                          RHONDA (cont'd)
                            So, is that one of your usual jobs,
                            saving peoples' lives?

                                          VAL
                                   (embarrassed)
                            First time for me.

               She gazes at him.  He looks away.  Over at the bar, Pham
               holds up a new pair of pants for Rhonda.

                                          RHONDA
                            Oh, thank you.

               Grateful for something to do, Val eases over to get the
               pants.  Rhonda looks after him.  Then she becomes aware of
               someone staring at her.  It's Earl, giving her a big Cheshire
               cat grin that says "What did I tell you?"

               Pham hands the pants to Val.  Then Pham and Miguel reach
               simultaneously for a sods bottle and -- knock it over!  It
               rolls all the way down the bar as a flurry of desperate hands
               try to stop it.  No good.  It rolls off the end and -- CRASH!

               Everyone freezes.  Sure enough the building shudders.  Floor
               boards creak and bend as searching tentacles thump and scrape
               along under the floor.  People close their eyes, not even
               breathing.  Finally the noise subsides.  Everyone relaxes --
               a little.

                                          MIGUEL
                            So what are we gonna do, you know?
                            How long till they go away?

                                          EARL
                                   (shakes his head)
                            They got the patience of Job.  They
                            just sit and goddamn wait til they
                            hear something that sounds like
                            lunch.  We need a plan.

                                          PHAM VAN
                            I've got a plan.  You and Val take
                            your truck, get to the mountains.
                            Hike to Bixby.  Get us some help.

                                          VAL
                            Those scumsuckers are my radials,
                            Pham!

                                          RHONDA
                            Well, we can take my truck then.

                                          EARL
                            No good.  You need major four-
                            wheel-drive just to get up that
                            jeep trail.

               They all shut up when they hear Viola's dog yapping in the
               distance.


         84    EXT.  VIOLA'S TRAILER - DAY                                  84

               Up the hill across from Pham Van's, the old trailer looks
               perfectly peaceful.  Except Viola's dog keeps yapping.  Then
               we hear panicked Viola.

                                          VIOLA (V.O.)
                            Quiet!  Quiet you hateful thing...!


         85    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 85

                                          EARL
                            Shut it up!  Shut the little
                            bastard up!

                                          VAL
                            Chuck him out the door!  Like a
                            little hors d'oeuvre.



               INT.  VIOLA'S TRAILER - DAY

               We hear a loud whap!  The dog's bark simply changes to
               piercing yelps.  It would be funny except --

               The trailer suddenly bucks upward, hit from below as though
               by a pile driver!  Again and again the unseen creatures slam
               into the frail structure.

                                          VIOLA (V.O.)
                            Get away!  Get away!  Oh God in
                            heaven, help me!

               The trailer is finally knocked right off its foundation!  It
               tips over and tumbles all the way down the hill!  As the dust
               clears, all is silent.  A huge hole is torn in the trailer's
               floor.  Viola's possessions are scattered everywhere.


         86    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 86

               Everyone stares in shock.

                                          RHONDA
                            Oh my God.

                                          EARL
                            Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid,
                            scum...

                                          VAL
                            Gotta do something.  Gotta get the
                            bastards!

                                          MIGUEL
                                   (hopeless)
                            Man, what the hell can we do to
                            those things?

                                          EARL
                            Well, we're sure as hell not going
                            to sit here being quiet for God
                            knows how long.  Are we?

                                          PHAM VAN
                            Now wait a minute, Earl.  I got
                            enough food here to last us for
                            weeks.  Those damn things can't
                            wait around forever.
                                   (pause)
                            We can do it.  I mean, if we have
                            to, right?

               Everyone turns away from the windows, gingerly sitting down,
               glumly pondering this possibility.  There is a long silence.

               Then suddenly -- ROAR!  The silence is shattered as Pham
               Van's big freezer compressor suddenly comes on.

                                          EARL
                            Jesus!  Shut it off!

               Pham runs to the freezer.  Its on/off switch is buried behind
               stacks of soft-drink cases.  He tears at them like a madman,
               toppling them this way and that.  Earl and Val join him.

               But right behind Pham, the floor BUCKLES UP, a monster's
               snout BURSTING THROUGH and engulfing one of his legs!  The
               creature starts to back down into the jagged hole, dragging
               screaming Pham with it.  Val, Earl, Rhonda, and Miguel grab
               Pham's arms but are no match for the monster.  It shakes and
               spins him like some gigantic dog, effortlessly throwing them
               off, relentlessly pulling Pham down.

               The hole in the floor is too small for Pham to fit through!
               As one leg goes down, the other is bent hideously backward.
               Pham screams and screams as jagged wood tears into him, bones
               snap, ribs crack.  The others grab him again but are utterly
               helpless.  With vicious, powerful jerks the creature yanks
               his man mangled body down.  The last thing we see is his foot,
               now folded back past his head, and he's gone.

               Val is wild with helpless anger.

                                          VAL
                            Son of a bitch!  Son of a bitch!

               The floor bulges up in another place!  A second creature!
               Then a third, coming RIGHT UP UNDER THEM!  Earl sprawls onto
               the bar.  Rhonda springs onto the shelves in the middle of the
               store, knocking groceries everywhere.  Val and Miguel climb up
               shelves which cover the rear wall of the store.

               The whole building shakes and shudders, dust powdering down
               from the ceiling.  Flailing tentacles are everywhere,
               slashing open food packages; clouds of flour fill the air!

               Val spots a hatch in the ceiling.

                                          VAL
                            Everybody!  This way!  The roof!

               Earl leaps from the bar to the rear shelves.  Val and Miguel
               slide sideways till they're beneath the hatch, then use the
               shelves as a ladder, climbing up to the hatch.  Val pounds on
               it frantically.

               In the middle of the store, Rhonda leaps from shelf to shelf,
               trying to get closer to where Val is.  Soon she reaches the
               last one, balancing precariously.  But a creature tips over
               the first one!  The shelves topple like dominoes, crashing
               toward Rhonda.  She is half catapulted, half jumps right
               through an open window, ripping through the screen.

               Val sees what's happened.  With maniacal strength he smashes
               open the hatch and climbs out onto --


         87    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          87

               Val rushes to the edge of the roof shouting:

                                          VAL
                            Rhonda!  Keep moving.  Don't stop!

               He looks down where Rhonda fell.  She's not there.  He hears
               a whistle and is relieved to see:


         88    EXT.  WATER TOWER - DAY                                      88

               Rhonda is perched as high as she can get on the water tower
               near Pham Van's.  It's maybe twenty-five feet tall, a simple
               wood frame holding a big galvanized tank.  The wooden legs
               stand on big concrete anchors buried in the ground.


         89    EXT.  STORAGE SHED - DAY                                     89

               Melvin peers terrified out the shed door, up at the guys on
               Pham Van's roof.

                                          MELVIN
                            Hey!  What's going on, man?!  What
                            the hell you doing up there...?!

                                          MIGUEL
                            Melvin, shut the hell up!

               It's too late.  Wham!  A creature strikes.  The little shed
               shudders, dust puffing from every old seam.  In a split
               second Melvin has climbed to the shed roof.


         90    EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    90

               Nancy and Mindy peer to the window, surprised to see the men
               on Pham Van's roof.


         91    EXT.  PERFECTION - WIDE - DAY                                91

               We hear Val's shouting to the remaining townsfolk.

                                          VAL
                            Nancy!  Nestor!


         92    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          92

                                          VAL
                            Get up on your roof!  On your roof!
                            They can come through the floor!

               The store shakes and shimmies.  We hear the monster's
               thunderous crashing from below.

                                          EARL
                            Can't you shout a little quieter?


         93    EXT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - DAY                           93

               Burt and Heather's place, about a mile from town, is no-
               nonsense, functional, ugly -- unpainted concrete walls, no
               yard, chain-link fence.  Burt and Heather drive up in their
               big Blazer and park right beside the house.  Hot and tired,
               they climb out, each carrying a heavy, scoped hunting rifle.
               Burt peers toward Perfection through binoculars during:

                                          HEATHER
                            I can't believe it.  No tracks, no
                            sign, no spoor.

                                          BURT
                            Yeah, whatever they are, you'd
                            think after they ate all those
                            sheep they'd have to take a dump
                            someplace...
                                   (reacts to what he sees)
                            What the hell's going on in town?


         94    EXT.  PERFECTION - TELEPHOTO - BURT'S P.O.V. - DAY           94

               The town is a very strange sight.  It's as though an
               invisible flood were in progress, driving people to high
               ground.  We see: Rhonda perched on the water tower; Val, Earl
               and Miguel on the store roof; Nancy and Mindy on their roof;
               Melvin on the storage shed; Nestor on his roof.


         95    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          95

               Val, Earl and Miguel gaze out at the town, trying to concoct
               a plan.   Suddenly Earl perks up.  The men speak softly.

                                          EARL
                            Hey, here's the plan: Nestor's
                            Cadillac.  His tires are nine
                            hundred sixteens.  We sprint for
                            it, grab the spare, put it on our
                            truck with our spare.

               Val stares at him, incredulous.

                                          VAL
                            How the hell long it take you to
                            change a tire?

                                          EARL
                                   (sighs)
                            Just about too damn long.  Bolt
                            pattern's probably wrong anyway.

                                          VAL
                            We need another plan.

               Suddenly, down in the store, Pham Van's CB radio squawks
               loudly.

                                          BURT (V.O.)
                            Yo, P.V., Burt here.  Come back.

               The building shudders as the creatures again smash through
               the floor inside, looking for the source of the noise.  Val,
               Earl and Miguel scramble to the edge of the roof.


         96    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 96

               The CB radio sits on a shelf near an open window.  Tentacles
               are feeling along the wall just below it.  Val appears out-
               side the window -- upside-down.  He snatches the radio and is
               hauled straight up out of frame.

                                          BURT (V.O.)
                            Pham?  Anybody copy?


         97    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          97

               Miguel and Earl haul Val by the feet back up onto the roof.
               Val quickly turns down the CB volume.

                                          VAL
                                   (whispers into mic)
                            Burt, now listen.  We found out
                            what's been killing people.  Over?


         98    INT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY                98

               A peculiar cross between bomb shelter and blue-collar den,
               Burt's wood-paneled basement has all the comforts for post-
               Apocalypse living.  Burt talks on his CB.

                                          BURT
                            Negative copy on that, Pham, check
                            your frequency.  I'm on forty-nine.

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                                   (a little louder)
                            Burt, can you hear me now?

                                          BURT
                            Just barely, Pham.  What are you
                            all doing up on your roofs. What
                            the hell's going on?  Come back.

               A few feet away Heather works at their ammunition reloading
               bench.  She dumps a few hundred empty cartridge cases into a
               case cleaner and switches it on.  It HUMS loudly as it
               vibrates.


         99    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 99

               The groping tentacles swiftly suck back below the floor.
               TILT UP to see out the window some distance away, a couple of
               old trash cans topple over as the creature streaks past
               beneath them, making a bee-line for Burt's.


         100   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          100

               Miguel points frantically at the trash cans.

                                          MIGUEL
                            Oh man, they're going, man!  I
                            think they're going for Burt!

               Val talks a little louder into the mic.  INTERCUT as needed.

                                          VAL
                            Burt!  This is Val!  Get out of
                            your basement!!  Take your radio!
                            You and Heather get up on your
                            roof!  Then we'll talk, okay?!

                                          BURT (V.O.)
                            Val?  What the hell you doing back
                            already?

                                          VAL
                                   (shouts)
                            Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof
                            or someplace!  We found out what's
                            been killing people!  They're under
                            the ground!

                                          BURT (V.O.)
                            What's under the ground?  We're not
                            getting up on the roof.  Earth
                            shelter's the best.  Known that
                            since I was a kid.

                                          VAL
                            Listen!  Listen!  We know what they
                            are!  They're big things under the
                            ground!  Much bigger than we
                            thought!  They're coming after you!
                            They're coming right now!


         101   INT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY                101

               Hearing that warning, Burt and Heather go into a well-honed
               drill.  They grab their hunting rifles and take positions at
               basement windows.  Burt scans with the binoculars.  He sees
               nothing.  He glances at Heather.  She shrugs.  Nobody coming.

                                          BURT
                                   (into CB)
                            We don't see anything, Val.  Now
                            what the hell are you talking
                            about?  Over.

               Val is frantic.  How do you explain these things?

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            They're coming underground!  They
                            ...they can dig like a son of a
                            bitch...Big monsters under the
                            ground, Burt!  Now get the hell
                            out!  Hurry!

               Burt and Heather exchange looks.  Has Val gone nuts?  Then
               they hear a low RUMBLE, growing louder and louder.  Tools
               hanging over the work bench start to shake; the decorative
               cow skulls on the wall rattle; the overhead lights sway --
               and then -- everything stops.  Dead silence, except for the
               humming of the case cleaner.

               THEN THE WALL MOVES!!  The wood paneling bulges slightly.
               Nails pop out.  The wall is pushed again; the paneling
               cracks.  A cow skull falls.  Burt and Heather level their
               rifles and --

               A huge creature pushes right through the wall!  Fully half
               its bulbous, spiked body writhes into the center of the
               room, great multi-part jaws drooling open, hook-tentacles
               lashing out.


         102   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          102

               The three men can hear the chaos over the CB.

                                          BURT (V.O.)
                            Jesus Chri...!

               The CB goes dead.  The men stare numbly.  Then, drifting
               across the desert, a soft popping sound.  The men perk up;
               they know what it is -- distant gunfire.


         103   INT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY                103

               The gunfire is DEAFENING as Burt and Heather blast away.
               Globby blood spurts from a dozen wounds, and the creature
               pulls back a little.  The couple keeps firing until magazines
               are empty.  The creature lunges forward again.

               PAN with Burt and Heather to REVEAL a wall of the basement we
               haven't seen until now -- a wall covered with guns -- hand
               guns, long guns, riot guns, flare guns, antique guns,
               military guns, elephant guns.

               Heather grabs an HK-91 assault rifle, slams in two magazines,
               bottoms taped end to end, and opens fire!  A hook-tentacle
               snags her boot, yanking her right off her feet.  Burt pumps
               out eight devastating blasts from a twelve-gauge riot gun,
               severing the tentacle.  Heather is on her feet in an instant.
               She expertly flops her double magazine over, loading the full
               one taped upside-down to it, and opens fire again.  Burt
               grabs an AR-15 semi-auto and joins her.  They lay down
               massive fire, virtually disappearing in muzzle flash and
               smoke.  Ejected shell cases clatter and clang all around the
               room.

               The guns are empty.  THE CREATURE IS STILL COMING!  They back
               down the wall, desperately grabbing weapons one after
               another: a lever-action, a magnum handgun, even a flare gun
               which Heather fires right into the creature's mouth.
               Shrieking in pain, the horrid thing thing KEEPS WRIGGLING
               TOWARD THEM!

               Burt and Heather scramble up over a desk to keep something
               between them and it.  Burt smashes open a fancy glass case
               holding a huge four-gauge elephant gun.  He slams in two
               gigantic cartridges nearly an inch in diameter.  He fires.
               The concussion literally shakes the building.  The recoil
               slams Burt back against the wall.

               The monster bullets tear monster holes in the monster.  Great
               gouts of curdles blood spew from it -- Burt hit an artery or
               something.  The beast convulses grotesquely, then collapses,
               deflating like a beached whale.  Burt and Heather stagger
               together and hug each other fervently.  They stare dumbfounded
               at the massive dead horror.  Burt suddenly shouts vehemently:

                                          BURT
                            Broke into the wrong goddamn rec
                            room, didn't you, you BASTARD!


         104   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          104

               Val, Earl and Miguel listen to the silence hoping for some
               sign that their friends are alive.  Suddenly:

                                          BURT (V.O. filter)
                            We killed it!  You got that?  We
                            killed that motherfucker!  Come
                            back!

               It takes a moment for this to sink in, then the men CHEER --
               as quietly as possible.

                                          VAL
                            Uh...roger that, Burt.  Uh,
                            congratulations.  Uh, be advised,
                            however, there are four more,
                            repeat, four more motherfuckers.
                            Come back.


         105   EXT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                    105

               Burt and Heather dash out onto the roof, laden with weapons,
               ammo boxes and their CB radio.  They hit the deck, assorted
               rifles and the elephant gun the ready.


         106   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          106

               Val shouts to everyone:

                                          VAL
                            They got one!  They killed one of
                            the sons of bitches!


         107   EXT.  STORAGE SHED - ROOF - DAY                              107

               Melvin pumps his fist in the air.

                                          MELVIN
                            Way to go, dudes!


         108   EXT. THE STERNGOOD HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                        108

               Nancy and Mindy hug each other.


         109   EXT.  NESTOR'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                            109

               Perched on his Spanish tile roof, Nestor pours coffee from
               his thermos and raises his cup in a toast.


         110   EXT.  WATER TOWER - DAY                                      110

               Rhonda lets out a WHOOP.


         111   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          111

               The men sit, temporarily jubilant.

                                          EARL
                            Well, I guess we don't get to make
                            fun of Burt's lifestyle anymore,
                            huh?

               Val grabs the CB mic.

                                          VAL
                            Burt, any chance you can get the
                            rest of them?


         112   EXT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                    112

               Burt and Heather peer from their fortress-like roof.  Burt
               spots earth bulging up near the foundation of his house.

                                          BURT
                                   (into CB)
                            One second, Val.

               He grabs the elephant gun and takes two well-aimed shots --
               two deafening BOOMS which echo off the distant mountains.
               But the bullets bury themselves harmlessly in the dirt.  The
               bulge in the dirt moves calmly away and sinks from view.
               Heather shakes her head.

                                          HEATHER
                            You're not getting any penetration,
                            even with the elephant gun.

                                          BURT
                            Damn!
                                   (into CB)
                            Val, we can't get them.  Never
                            figured on having to shoot through
                            dirt!  Best goddamn bullet stop
                            there is.  Come back.


         113   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          113

               The men are disappointed.  That's not what they wanted to
               hear from Burt.  Then Earl perks up and grab the CB mic.

                                          EARL
                                   (into CB)
                            Okay, Burt, listen.  Forget
                            shooting them.  Tell me this: can
                            you get to your truck?

                                          BURT (V.O.)
                            No problem.

                                          EARL
                            Good.  You've got the only truck in
                            the valley that can make it up that
                            damn jeep trail.  So, here's the
                            plan: You and Heather go for help.
                            Get to the mountains...

               But Rhonda interrupts, pointing urgently from the water
               tower.

                                          RHONDA
                            Hey, guys!  They're up to
                            something.

               Val, Earl and Miguel rush to the edge of the roof and look
               down where she's pointing --

               A creature is running its tentacles along the building's
               foundation.  It's a strange, more studied movement than we've
               seen before.

                                          VAL
                                   (to Rhonda)
                            What's it doing?

                                          RHONDA
                            Why do you all keep asking me?

               They all stare nervously down as the tentacles feel their way
               along the wall, moving toward a corner of the building.
               Suddenly Miguel spots something down the next wall.

                                          MIGUEL
                            Hey, there's another one coming!

               Another set of tentacles is feeling along the adjacent wall.
               The two creatures meet at the corner, their tentacles touch-
               ing rather like ants' antennae.  They they submerge; tenta-
               cles zipping into the earth.  Nothing happens for a moment.

               Then the corner of the building suddenly heaves up a couple
               of feet.  Clapboard siding splits.  A warped window shatters.
               (We don't see the creatures, only the effect of their shoving
               from below).  The men nearly lose their balance.  Then the
               corner sinks back down.

                                          EARL
                            What the hell was that all about?


         114   EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    114

               Nancy and Mindy are still huddled on the roof.  They don't
               make a sound.  They're startled when the house suddenly
               groans and tilts as creatures give it a tentative shove.
               Nancy and Mindy frantically cling to the peak of the smooth
               roof.  The picture windows shatters.  We hear beams POP and
               CRACK, dishes CRASH off shelves.  The front screen door
               swings open.  At last the house slowly settles back down.


         115   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          115

               The men are watching Nancy's house tensely.

                                          MIGUEL
                            They weren't making no noise.
                            Why they bothering them for?

                                          VAL
                                   (mind racing)
                            They're studying the buildings...
                            trying to figure them out.

               Rhonda chimes in from the water tower.

                                          RHONDA
                            Yeah, they're confused.  They can
                            feel our vibrations, but they can't
                            find us.

                                          VAL
                            They're working together, too.

                                          EARL
                            Yeah, like they got a plan...

                                          BURT (V.O.)
                            Breaker there, Earl.  What do you
                            want us to do?

                                          EARL
                                   (into CB)
                            Hang on, Burt.  The bastards are up
                            to something.


         116   EXT.  NESTOR'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                            116

               Straddling the peak of his steeply sloping roof.  Nestor
               grabs on in panic as the creatures lift the place up slowly!
               The roof warps, Spanish tiles shatter and rain down on the
               ground.

               This causes a flurry of activity.  Tentacles snake around
               where the tiles fell.  We hear creatures crash through
               inside, snorting and huffing.  They attack the house in
               earnest, shaking it violently, pushing the front wall out
               till it falls flat.  The roof collapses on that side!  Nestor
               can't hang on!  He slides all the way down, landing across a
               window on the flattened wall.  The next instant he's grabbed
               and pulled through the window, right into the ground.  He
               SCREAMS!

               DOLLY along the ground, heading toward the storage shed where
               Melvin is.  All we can see is dirt, but we can still hear
               Nestor screaming UNDERGROUND!  His screams get more and more
               faint as DOLLY ENDS on:


         117   EXT.  STORAGE SHED - DAY                                     117

               CLOSE ON horrified Melvin as he rocks back and forth
               autistically.

                                          MELVIN
                            Oh, wow, man!  No way!  No fucking
                            way, man...!


         118   EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                             118

               Nancy comforts Mindy.


         119   EXT.  WATER TOWER - DAY                                      119

               Rhonda turns away.


         120   EXT.  PHAM CAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          120

               Val, Earl and Miguel stare in horror and disbelief.  Miguel
               crosses himself.  They're in worse trouble than they thought.

                                          VAL
                            They knocked his place down on
                            purpose, man.  They're gonna tear
                            this whole town out from under us!


         121   EXT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - DAY                           121

               Burt and Heather's truck is parked in foreground.  The couple
               is up on the roof in background.  Burt prowls along the edge
               of the roof with the elephant gun.  Heather mans the C.B.

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            Burt!  Heather!

                                          HEATHER
                            Yeah, Val.

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            We're in deep shit over here.
                            Let's change that plan.

               A hump of dirt raises near the base of the house.  Burt jerks
               the rifle to his shoulder and squeezes off a shot.  The hump
               moves away from the house.

                                          HEATHER
                            Knock it off, Burt!

                                          BURT
                            I think I scared it!

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            Forget going for help.  We'll all
                            be dead long before you get back.

               Still moving away, the hump of dirt passes under the side-
               walk, rippling the flagstones gently.

                                          HEATHER
                                   (into CB)
                            We're here, Val.  Just tell us what
                            you need.  Come back.

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            They're tearing down the houses
                            here!  We all gotta get outta here
                            together!  Now!

               The hump of dirt passes under Burt and Heather's truck,
               rocking the vehicle slightly.

                                          HEATHER
                            We're with you, Val.  We'll come
                            get everybody.  Just hang on tight.

               The truck's security alarm starts BOOPING!  Burt and Heather
               stare down helplessly as the noisy truck is furiously
               attacked by the frenzied creatures.  Dust flies as metal rips
               and tires shred.


         122   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          122

               Val Earl and Miguel listen in disbelief to the distant truck
               alarm.  It finally sputters and dies.

                                          HEATHER (V.O.)
                            Val, we're going to have to forget
                            about the truck...

                                          VAL
                                   (into CB)
                            Yeah, Heather, we got you.

               They've hit rock-bottom.  They sit in helpless, desperate
               silence.

               Over on the storage shed roof, Melvin is losing it:

                                          MELVIN
                            Hey, you better think of something,
                            man!  You gotta do something!

                                          EARL
                            Who?

                                          MELVIN
                            You and Val, man!

               Miguel nods in agreement.  Val and Earl stare at him,
               incredulous.

                                          VAL
                            What?!!  Since when the hell's
                            every goddamn thing up to us?!

                                          RHONDA
                                   (flatly)
                            You guys do all the odd jobs.

               Val just stares at her.

               Then -- CRASH!  The store shudders, creaks, and groans.  The
               creatures are back.  One corner of the store lifts up, beams
               splintering.  Then another corner lifts up!  The roof tilts
               like the deck of a storm-tossed ship.  From now on the
               monsters shake and ram the building almost constantly.
               Hanging on tight, the men peer over the edge.

                                          EARL
                            We don't have a hell of a lot of
                            time here.

               Meanwhile, Rhonda tries her desperate best to be logical:

                                          RHONDA
                            Look, the situation hasn't changed.
                            We still have to get to solid rock.
                            There must be some way!

                                          VAL
                                   (shouts, angry)
                            Like what?!  There's nothing left
                            that'll make it to the mountains!

                                          MIGUEL
                            Hey, Val, quiet, man!

                                          VAL
                            We need a helicopter is what we
                            need, or a goddamn tank...

                                          EARL
                            Wait a minute...the Cat.  Could we
                            take the Cat?

                                          VAL
                                   (dubious)
                            Jesus.  It's slower than hell.

                                          EARL
                            Yeah, but it weighs better than
                            thirty tons.  No way they could
                            stop it.

                                          MIGUEL
                            We can't all fit on that bulldozer.

               But Val is warming to the idea.

                                          VAL
                            But...we could pull something!  We
                            could, I don't know, drag a car
                            behind it!

                                          EARL
                            A car, huh?  Like a big armored
                            car?  Need something bigger,
                            tougher...our truck maybe...or,
                            hell, that old semi trailer!

                                          VAL
                            Its tires are flat...

                                          EARL
                            Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull
                            anything.

                                          VAL
                            Well...all right!  We just roll on
                            out of here!

                                          EARL
                            We got a plan!

               They squint at the bulldozer -- 'way in the distance.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            'Course, that's one helluva long
                            walk.

               They stare grimly, momentarily stuck for an idea.  Then:

                                          RHONDA
                            Listen, they only respond to
                            vibration, right?  Couldn't we...
                            distract them somehow?

                                          VAL
                            Yeah, good!  Something to keep them
                            busy.  We need a decoy.

                                          EARL
                            Hey, Melvin, you wanna make a buck?

                                          MELVIN
                            Fuck you!

               Miguel grabs Earl and points down at little garden tractor in
               a jumble of Pham Van's equipment and tools near the side of
               the store.

                                          MIGUEL
                            Hey, how about the tractor?  Start
                            him up.  Let him go by itself.  Let
                            those things chase it all over is
                            they like that noise.

                                          EARL
                                   (nodding)
                            Not bad.
                                   (to Val)
                            What do you think?

               The store takes a heavy hit.  The front porch collapses with
               a terrific crash.

                                          VAL
                            I think the ground's getting
                            closer.  I think we do it.  We're
                            gonna save our asses here!

                                          RHONDA
                            Wait!  How are you going to know
                            they're all following it?

                                          VAL
                            Good point.

                                          EARL
                            We got two right here.

               Val scrambles to the highest point of the sagging roof and
               shouts to Nancy.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Nancy, we gotta find all four of
                            them.  How many you got over there?


         123   EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                             123

               The house shuddering and shaking.

                                          NANCY
                            There's one.  I think one.


         124   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          124

               Earl grabs the CB mic.

                                          EARL
                                   (into CB)
                            Burt, Heather, we got a little sort
                            of a plan going here, maybe.  Can
                            you tell if you've still got any of
                            those things out at your place?
                            Come back.


         125   EXT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                    125

                                          BURT
                                   (into CB)
                            Yeah, still got one poking around.

                                          EARL (V.O.)
                            That's four.  Let us know if it
                            starts moving, Burt.

                                          BURT
                            Roger that.


         126   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - TRACTOR - DAY                       126

               Val and Earl have lowered Miguel down to a window sill right
               above the garden tractor.  He has used his kerchief to tie
               the steering wheel to keep the front wheels straight.  He
               jams the throttle open and signals thumbs-up to Val and Earl
               above.


         127   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          127

               Val and Earl stride purposefully toward the opposite end of
               the roof.  Realizing they have the same idea, each one tries
               to edge ahead of the other.

                                          VAL
                            I'm making the run to the Cat.

                                          EARL
                            Like hell you are.

                                          VAL
                            Get real.  I'm faster than you.

                                          EARL
                            I'm best at driving the Cat.

                                          VAL
                            Only if something happens to me.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            Look, you'd better listen.  I'm
                            older and wiser.

                                          VAL
                            Yeah, well, you're half right.

               Earl raises a fist: The Challenge.  They do scissors-rock-
               paper.  One, two, three.  Val loses.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Damn.  Guess I have to do it.

                                          EARL
                                   (shakes his head)
                            I won.  I pick who does it.

               Val glares at him.  Earl's obviously determined.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            Ready when you are, Miguel!

               Earl positions himself, nervous as hell, ready to leap at the
               right moment.


         128   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - TRACTOR - DAY                       128

               Miguel leans out precariously and pulls the tractor's starter
               cord.  Nothing.  On the second try it starts.  He slams it
               into gear and sends it out toward open desert.  The store
               shakes under Miguel, almost knocking him off the window sill,
               as two humps of dirt pursue the noisy tractor.

                                          MIGUEL
                            There they go!  They're chasing it!


         129   EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    129

               A "spout" of dust erupts near the foundation as the creature
               beneath zooms away toward the new sound.  Nancy whispers:

                                          NANCY
                            It's going...
                                   (then shouts)
                            There goes this one!  It's going!


         130   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          130

               The CB radio squawks:

                                          BURT (V.O.)
                            Hey, this guy just took off like a
                            shot.  What'd you people do?

               Earl is poised to leap.  Val steps up and slaps him on the
               back.

                                          VAL
                            Watch your ass, shithead.

                                          EARL
                            Don't worry about me, jerkoff.

               Val instantly elbows Earl hard in the stomach.  As Earl
               doubles over, Val springs off the edge of the roof.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            You goddamn suicidal son of a
                            bitch!

               We see Val running for all he's worth -- and there's the
               bulldozer at the edge of town a long way away.


         131   EXT.  DESERT - DAY                                           131

               LOW CAMERA pursues the garden tractor as it bounces along.


         132   EXT.  PERFECTION - DAY                                       132

               Val charges across the vast open area that separates him from
               the bulldozer.  We can hear the tractor droning along in the
               background.


         133   EXT.  DESERT - DAY                                           133

               The tractor suddenly takes a bad bounce and flips over!  The
               engine dies.  Total silence.


         134   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          134

               Earl, Rhonda and Miguel have seen the tractor take a header.

                                          EARL
                            Oh my God!


         135   EXT.  EDGE OF TOWN - VAL - DAY                               135

               Val's crunching boots seem incredibly loud in the sudden
               silence.  He hesitates, glancing over his shoulder.  He's
               totally out in the open, halfway to the bulldozer.  Should he
               run back or go forward?  He decides to go for the bulldozer.


         136   EXT.  DESERT - DAY                                           136

               All four creatures are now heading for Val.  INTERCUT four
               slightly different LOW CAMERA ANGLES speeding over the
               ground, racing after him.  He strains to the limit, breaths
               coming in painful rasps -- but the creatures are closing in
               on him with chilling ease.


         137   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          137

               Everyone watches in horror.

                                          EARL
                            He'll never make it!  They're gonna
                            get him!

                                          RHONDA
                                   (yells)
                            VAL, STOP!  THEY'RE COMING!  DON'T
                            MOVE!


         138   EXT.  EDGE OF TOWN - VAL - DAY                               138

               Val hears her and stops dead.  So do the creatures.  Maybe
               twenty feet away, their giant snouts poke up out of the
               ground: one, two, three, four.  Val stands trembling.  The
               creatures softly shuffle back and forth, searching blindly
               for him, hook-tentacles feeling everywhere.  One tentacle
               sweeps toward Val's boot.  He manages to lift his foot just
               in time, letting the tentacle pass beneath it.  He balances
               precariously like a flamingo.


         139   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          139

                                          EARL
                            It worked!  They can't find him!
                                   (pause)
                            Okay, okay...uh...we gotta make
                            some noise...a lot of noise!  HEY,
                            YOU SORRY SONS OF BITCHES, COME AND
                            GET ME...!!!!

               He starts jumping noisily up and down.  Miguel joins in,
               cursing the monsters in Spanish.



         139A  EXT.   WATER TOWER - DAY                                     139A

               Rhonda kicks and shouts.  But it's obvious they need some-
               thing louder.  She spots the aging outlet pipe coming from
               the water tank.  Bracing herself, she kicks at it with both
               feet.  It finally gives way at a rusted joint.  A torrent of
               water blasts out, thundering into the dirt.


         140   EXT.  EDGE OF TOWN - VAL - DAY                               140

               All the creatures wheel about in the dirt and zoom off toward
               town.  Val breathes a big sigh of relief and sprints to the
               bulldozer.


         141   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          141

                                          EARL
                            That did it, girl!  Goddamn good
                            thinking!


         142   EXT.  WATER TOWER - DAY                                      142

               A mass of tentacles and snouts swirl through the big puddle
               where the water if falling.  The creatures' breathing throws
               up spouts of muddy water.  Rhonda looks down nervously.  Earl
               calls reassuringly from Pham Van's:

                                          EARL
                            Don't worry.  No way they can lift
                            that tower.  I mean it's really
                            heavy.

               The dirt begins to cave in around the tower's footing.  The
               creatures are digging the dirt away!


         144   BACK TO SCENE                                                144

               The water tower tilts ever so slightly, creaking and
               groaning!  Rhonda frantically grabs a handhold.

                                          RHONDA
                            They're not trying to lift it!


         145   EXT.  BULLDOZER - DAY                                        145

               Val lands in the driver's seat and turns the engine over --
               it doesn't start!

                                          VAL
                            NO FUCKING WAY!

               The old machine starts.  Val slams it into reverse and backs
               up toward the semi trailer.


         146   EXT.  WATER TOWER - DAY                                      146

               The water tower is starting to tilt seriously.  Water spills
               over the top edge of the tank, drenching Rhonda.


         147   EXT.  BULLDOZER - DAY                                        147

               Val has used heavy chains on the back of the bulldozer to
               jerry-rig a hitch to the semi trailer.   Now he scrambles
               back into the driver's seat.  He guns the engine, wrenching
               the old semi trailer from years of dried mud and tumbleweeds.
               Ancient tires disintegrate.  Rusted wheels screech and
               complain -- but it moves.  Val lets out a whoop and heads
               full-tilt for town.  He's suddenly shocked as he sees:


         148   EXT.  WATER TOWER - DAY                                      148

               Rhonda's in big trouble.  She scrambles to the high side of
               the tower platform.  The tower's going to tip over at any
               moment!  It's roof slides off and crashes into the street!

               On Pham Van's, Miguel and Earl are tearing apart the swamp
               cooler, throwing pieces of it off the roof, trying to
               distract the creatures, but they can't compete with the noise
               from the water.

               In BG the bulldozer rumbles toward the tower at top speed --
               an excruciatingly slow eight miles per hour.

               The tremendously heavy water tank suddenly tears loose,
               sliding off its platform, nearly carrying Rhonda with it.
               She ends up hanging from a cross beam as the water tank
               splatters like an enormous egg below, sending a small tidal
               wave down the street.

               The remains of the tower tilt crazily nearly forty-five
               degrees.  The bulldozer grinds closer and closer.  Rhonda
               tries to climb up, but the jostling and shuddering of the
               tower keeps her dangling precariously.  Suddenly she falls!

               And lands in the dirt.  The creatures zero in on her!  She
               turns wildly and leaps for the blade of the approaching
               bulldozer.  The blade is only inches off the ground but Val
               swiftly raises it, lifting Rhonda high into the air just
               above the grasping tentacles!


         149   EXT.  PERFECTION - MAIN STREET - DAY                         149

               As Rhonda climbs down into the cab, Val heads the bulldozer
               over to Pham Van's and stops.  Almost as soon as he does,
               creatures attack, a frenzy of tentacles grabbing at all sides
               of the massive earth-moving machine, slithering into the
               treads.  Val and Rhonda watch this nervously as Earl and
               Miguel quickly clamber from the roof down into the protective
               steel belly of the semi trailer.

               Val mentally crosses his fingers and sends the bulldozer
               roaring forward.  It effortlessly tears loose from the
               tentacles, grinding one to pulp in its treads.  The creature
               shrieks in pain.  The humans cheer!  At last they've got the
               upper hand!


         150   EXT.  STORAGE SHED - DAY                                     150

               Melvin dances merrily, and noisily, on the metal rooftop.

                                          MELVIN
                            Way to go!  Dumb fucking worms!
                            Now haul ass over here, man!  Me
                            next!  Get me off of here...!

               The flimsy shed seems almost to explode as a furious creature
               roars up inside.  The walls buckle out.  The whole structure
               sags.  Melvin scrambles to peak of the roof.

                                          MELVIN
                            Oh shit!  Oh, God!  Help!

               As the unseen creature thrashes around inside the shed, the
               walls topple outward and the roof drops to the ground like a
               pancake.  Melvin has lost all self control and just keeps
               screaming.  Val pulls along side, jumps down onto the tread,
               and reaches out to Melvin.  But just as they join hands, the
               creature hits the roof from beneath, dragging it several
               feet.  Val is yanked off the bulldozer and lands with Nelvin
               on the roof!

               The creature slams into the roof repeatedly, but the
               corrugated metal is both light and resilient.  It bends, but
               the frustrated monster can't get enough "bite" to tear
               through it.  Val and Melvin straddle the peak of the roof,
               trying desperately to hang on as it heaves up, buckling like a
               bronco.

               Earl scrambles into the bulldozer driver's seat and heads
               after them at full throttle, the big diesel roaring.

               Melvin and Val prepare to jump onto the bulldozer, but just
               before it reaches them the roof suddenly starts to slide like
               some mad flying carpet, carried from beneath by a creature!
               Val hangs on like a rodeo rider, struggling to keep fear-
               crazed Melvin from tumbling off.


         151   EXT.  DIRT DITCH - DAY                                       151

               The roof zigs and zags, spins and twists.  Melvin and Val
               won't be shaken loose.  Earl does his best to head it off,
               but it's hard to predict which way the roof will scoot next.

               The rood careens alongside the edge of a dirt-walled drainage
               ditch, then suddenly skitters sideways and plunges over the
               edge.  Melvin and Val tumble to the bottom.  As they jump to
               their feet:

                                          VAL
                            We got about three seconds!

               Val sees, almost right above them, an exposed pipe which
               spans the ditch.  He shoves Melvin toward it.  They leap up
               and grab the pipe, pulling their legs up as high as they can.
               An instant later, the creature blasts through one wall of the
               ditch, roars past beneath them and burrows into the opposite
               wall!

               Earl brings the bulldozer to a thundering stop next to them.

                                          EARL
                            Well, come on!


         152   EXT.   NANCY'S HOUSE - DAY                                   152

               Nancy and Mindy huddle together on their roof.  The upraised
               scoop blade of the bulldozer comes INTO SHOT with Val riding
               it.  He helps them step across into it.


         153   EXT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                    153

               Burt is using a hacksaw to cut lengths from a heavy vertical
               pipe to which his TV antenna was anchored.  Heather works
               with the sections Burt has already cut off.  She is filling
               them with gunpowder from reloading cannisters and hammering
               the ends shut -- they're making bombs.

               Then they hear rumbling.  What is it, more creatures?  They're
               surprised by the odd sight of the strange contraption
               approaching.

                                          BURT
                                   (impressed)
                            God damn!  Armored transport!

               Val climbs up on the bulldozer roll cage so he's about even
               with Heather and Burt.  A creature occasionally slams into the
               underside of the bulldozer of the semi trailer, rocking them
               slightly, throwing up clouds of dust.

                                          VAL
                            Let's go you two.  We're headed for
                            the mountains.

                                          BURT
                            In a minute.

               He grabs a coil of blackpowder cannon fuse.  He cuts off a
               length and stuffs it in the end of one of the pipe bombs
               during:

                                          VAL
                            Come on, Burt, we can't hold still
                            long.  They're damn smart and
                            getting smarter by the minute.

               Burt hefts the finished bomb.

                                          BURT
                            That's fine.  We've got some new
                            things to teach them.

                                          VAL
                            Damn it!  They'll sink this rig
                            just like a boat!

               Just then the bulldozer starts to tilt sideways, creatures
               digging dirt away beneath it.  Earl guns it forward out of
               the depression they're making.

                                          EARL
                            See that?  They're doing it now!
                            They try it every time we hold
                            still.

               Burt and Heather are impressed.  They rush around the
               rooftop, gathering food, ammo, guns, the finished bombs,
               handing them to impatient Val who hands them down to people
               in the semi trailer during:

                                          VAL
                            Jesus Christ, we're only going nine
                            miles.  Be there in two hours, tops!

                                          BURT
                            Yeah, well those things are gonna
                            be on our ass every foot of the
                            way, right?

               He holds up to rifles to Heather, the HK91 assault rifle and
               another elephant gun.

                                          BURT
                            What do you think?  Max firepower
                            or...?

                                          HEATHER
                            I'd go for penetration.  The 458
                            shooting solids -- less ammo to
                            carry anyway.

               Burt nods.  Everyone on the bulldozer and semi trailer shouts:

                                          TOWNSFOLK
                                   (adlib)
                            Come on!
                            Who cares!
                            Forget it!
                            Let's go!

               Dust flies up.  The bulldozer tilts.  Earl guns it forward
               again.  Heather and Burt grab a few more things and leap down
               into the semi trailer.

                                          MELVIN
                            Give me a gun!  I'll take one!

                                          BURT
                            I wouldn't give you a gun if it was
                            World War Three.

               Earl pilots the strange looking contraption out into the
               desert.  Burt and Heather watch their fortress-home recede.

                                          BURT
                            Food for five years.  A thousand
                            gallons of gas.  Air filtration.
                            Water filtration.  Geiger counter.
                            Bomb shelter...
                                   (looks heavenward)
                            ...underground goddamn monsters?!

               Heather puts a consoling arm around him.


         154   EXT.  JEEP TRAIL - DAY                                       154

               The bulldozer easily lumbers along the really rough road we
               saw Val and Earl's truck struggle over the other morning.

               As they come closer we see Burt and Heather riding "shotgun,"
               he sitting out in the bulldozer's scoop, she on the rear of
               the semi trailer, elephant guns at the ready.  Val, Earl and
               Rhonda are in the cab.


         155   EXT.  CLIFFS - DAY                                           155

               It's late afternoon, sun casting dramatic shadows across the
               beautiful desert.  We are WIDE on the bizarre vehicle,
               resolutely grinding along not far from the cliffs, nearing
               the mountains ahead.


         156   EXT.  DESERT - BULLDOZER - DAY                               156

               As they scan the desert, the people are feeling like they may
               get out of this after all.  Earl calls back to the people in
               the semi trailer.

                                          EARL
                            Any sign of'em?

                                          MIGUEL
                            Maybe they just gave up, you know.

                                          MELVIN
                            Yeah, the bulldozer's too much for
                            them, man.

               As they top a gentle rise, Burt excitedly points ahead.

                                          BURT
                            There we go, solid rock!

               Everyone cheers.  But then Heather points up ahead to one
               side.

                                          HEATHER
                            What's that?


         157   P.O.V. - THE GROUP - DUST CLOUD - DAY                        157

               Perhaps two hundred yards from them, a huge cloud of dust
               wells up from behind big boulders.


         158   BACK TO SCENE                                                158

               Everyone stares uneasily at the billowing cloud.

                                          NANCY
                            Is it them?

                                          MIGUEL
                            What else could it be?

                                          MINDY
                            What're they doing?

                                          MELVIN
                            Maybe they're taking a dump.

                                          RHONDA
                            We're not going over there, right?

                                          EARL
                            No.  We go straight.

                                          VAL
                            Damn it.  What the hell are they
                            doing?  They're up to something.

                                          EARL
                            I don't care what they're doing as
                            long as they're doing it way over
                            there.

               Earl shoves the throttle all the way.  The engine screams.


         159   EXT.  DESERT - DUSTCLOUD - DAY                               159

               We MOVE IN through the cloud of dust.  Dirt is flying by the
               ton out of en eight foot diameter hole in the ground.  A huge
               mound of the tunneled-out dirt is already piled high.  The
               creatures are digging a tunnel -- but why?


         160   EXT.  DESERT - BULLDOZER - DAY                               160

               We watch the bulldozer rumbling along.  It seems unstop-
               able.  The mountains and safety are barely a mile away --

               when the EARTH CAVES IN!!  THE BULLDOZER PLUNGES NOSE FIRST
               INTO AN UNSEEN PIT DUG JUST BENEATH THE SURFACE!

               The machine ends up half-buried at a steep angle.  The semi
               trailer is right on the edge of the pit.  Everyone is shaken,
               bruised, bloodied.  Val, Earl and Rhonda look frantically for
               Burt, who was riding out front in the scoop.  They're
               relieved to see him clawing his way out of pit.  Val hauls
               him up and all four of them now leap into the semi trailer.
               As they come to rest, Val slowly realizes what's happened.

                                          VAL
                            They...they dug a trap!  I can't
                            believe this!

               The idling bulldozer engine coughs and dies.  There is a
               moment's crushing silence.

               Then the dreaded digging begins.  Dust boils up around the
               semi trailer -- creatures digging from below!  The semi
               trailer shakes and shudders, slowly sinking.  The people
               huddle together in sheer panic.  Val and Earl grab the
               nearest of Burt and Heather's guns and fire wildly, hope-
               lessly, down at the dirt.  Ricochets whine into the distance.

               Burt grimly digs an overloaded knapsack for one of his
               pipe bombs.  He leaps up between Val and Earl and lights the
               fuse, looking for a target.

                                          BURT
                            Hungry?!  Eat this!!

               He tosses the bomb at some churning earth and dives back into
               the semi trailer.

                                          BURT (cont'd)
                            Keep your heads down!

               KABOOM!  The explosion throws up a big plume of dust and
               rocks.  We hear a new, very strange sound of pain from the
               creatures.  The semi trailer instantly stops shaking.  The
               creatures have stopped digging.  All is quiet.

               The people peer up over the edge of the semi trailer, looking
               all around.  Then:

                                          RHONDA
                            There they are!


         161   P.O.V. THE GROUP - DISTANT CREATURES                         161

               Numerous spurts of dust mark their paths as they race madly
               away, fanning out from the semi trailer.


         162   BACK TO SCENE                                                162

                                          MIGUEL
                            Hey, Burt...did you get one...!

                                          RHONDA
                            No, there's still four of them.
                            See...there's like four different
                            dust trails.

                                          VAL
                            Sure got their attention, though.
                            Nice going, Burt.
                                   (to Earl)
                            Earl, what about the Cat?

               Earl's already staring down at the bulldozer.

                                          EARL
                            No way.  It's down for the count.

               Val looks around.


         163   P.O.V.  VAL - ROCK OUTCROP                                   163

               Toward the cliffs he sees a big rock outcrop.


         164   BACK TO SCENE                                                164

               Rhonda points in the opposite direction from where Val is
               looking.

                                          RHONDA
                            Here they come!  They're coming
                            back!

               Heather unexpectedly fire two deafening blasts from her
               elephant gun at the approaching creatures, then shakes her
               head, frustrated.  They're still coming.

                                          VAL
                            Come on, everybody!  We gotta run
                            for those rocks over there!

                                          EARL
                            Jesus, Val, it's pretty far.

                                          MELVIN
                            Yeah, man!  They'll get us!

                                          VAL
                            There sure as hell get us if we
                            stay here!

                                          RHONDA
                            Wait, wait, listen.  Burt do you
                            have any more of those things?

                                          BURT
                            The bombs?  Damn right I do.

                                          RHONDA
                            Well, what is you throw one that
                            way, the way we want to go...
                                   (points toward rocks)
                            Then, when the explosion happens...
                            if it drives them away again...we
                            all run like goddamn bastards!
                                   (to Earl)
                            Pardon my French.

               Wham!  With a jolt the semi trailer begins shaking and
               shuddering again -- sinking, smiling.

                                          MELVIN
                            What if it doesn't scare them?
                            What if they don't run?

                                          RHONDA
                            I don't think it does scare them!
                            It hurts them!  They're  so
                            sensitive to sound, they have to
                            run!  It hurts too much!

               Glances all around.

                                          BURT
                            She's got my vote.

                                          VAL
                            Right.  We're gonna run.  Get
                            ready.

               Val squats in front of tear-streaked Mindy.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Mindy, you understand what we're
                            going to do?
                                   (off her nod)
                            And don't worry, they can't get us
                            once we're on those rocks.

                                          MELVIN
                            I don't know, man.  They're too
                            fast!  You can't outrun them, no
                            way!

               As Burt readies another bomb, he pauses to hand bug-eyed
               Melvin a huge Ruger Super Redhawk 44 magnum handgun.

                                          BURT
                            Here, kid.  This'll make'em think
                            twice.

               Melvin's eyes bug out further.  Burt lights his bomb.

                                          BURT (cont'd)
                            Heads down!!

               He hurls the bomb.  Wait.  Wait.  WHOOOM!  Again we hear the
               creatures' unearthly shriek of pain.  Rhonda's on her feet
               before the rocks stop falling.  She spots the creatures.

                                          RHONDA
                            It worked!  There they go!

                                          VAL
                            LET'S DO IT!

               Earl lets out a war wild WHOOP.  It's infectious.  CRANE UP
               with them as everyone piles out of the semi trailer like
               soldiers out of a trench -- they charge across no-man's-land.

               Melvin runs like a demon.  He tries to shoot at the first
               thing he sees but the gun just clicks over and over -- empty.

                                          MELVIN
                            Burt, you bastard!

               Enraged, he doubles his speed, trying to overtake Burt.

               Mindy can't keep up.  Nancy tries to pull her along.  Val and
               Earl swoop in, grab Mindy under either arm, and carry her
               between them.


         165   ANGLE - THE CREATURES                                        165

               The ground heaves violently as the retreating monsters
               angrily wheel about and charge back after the humans.


         166   EXT.  DESERT - ROCK OUTCROP - DAY                            166

               Big slabs jutting this way and that -- a rock iceberg in a
               sand ocean.  The people scramble onto it amid whoops of joy
               and relief.  Melvin charges up to Burt:

                                          MELVIN
                            You asshole!  There's no bullets in
                            this gun!

                                          BURT
                            Got you moving, didn't it?

               Burt's line gets a laugh from people, but then tentacles
               burst up on all sides of the rock, probing, feeling.  The
               effect is instantly sobering.  Burt swiftly grabs out his
               remaining bombs -- six of them -- and holds one ready.  But
               they're in no immediate danger.

                                          EARL
                            So...now what?

                                          RHONDA
                            Could we make it to the mountains?

                                          VAL
                                   (gestures to Burt's bombs)
                            No way.  We'd need fifty of those
                            things.

               The hopelessness of the situation suddenly hits Val, Earl,
               and Rhonda.  After a moment:

                                          EARL
                            Well...that's it.  We're not
                            getting off this rock...

                                          VAL
                            Not going to pole vault anywhere.
                            That's for sure.

                                          HEATHER
                            What's the matter with you?  What
                            are you talking about?!

                                          RHONDA
                            They'll just wait out there till
                            we're dead.  That's what they do.

               As this sinks in, Burt loses his cool, igniting an argument.

                                          BURT
                            What?  Well, for chrissake, we
                            could have made a stand at our
                            place!  We had food, water...

                                          EARL
                            You can't fight'em that way...

                                          BURT
                            You two jackasses hauled us way the
                            hell out here...!?

                                          VAL
                            BACK OFF, BURT...!

                                          BURT
                            Well, who put you two in charge?

                                          NANCY
                                   (shouts)
                            Burt!  Those animals would have
                            killed you!

               Everyone stares in surprise at normally quiet Nancy.

                                          NANCY (cont'd)
                                   (softly)
                            You haven't seen what they can do.

                                          VAL
                                   (calmer)
                            They'd have dug your place out from
                            under you in half an hour!

               There's a long, grim silence.  Everyone sits glumly.
               Finally, Burt picks up a bomb and contemplates it:

                                          BURT
                                   (losing it)
                            If it comes to starvation, I know
                            what I'm doing.  Take one of these.
                            Walk right out there with the fuse
                            lit.  Stuff it down my pants and
                            let 'em take me down.  BOOOOM!

               Heather puts a soothing hand on his shoulder.

                                          HEATHER
                            Jesus, honey!

               But now Earl brightens a little.

                                          EARL
                            You know, that's not a bad idea!

               The others react.  Is Earl nuts?

                                          EARL
                            No, I mean, it gives me an idea...
                            going fishing like...


         167   EXT.  DESERT - ROCK OUTCROP - LATER                          167

               In the open desert, a rock lands.  Then another.  Val and
               Rhonda are throwing them from the rock outcrop.

               Val, Earl, Rhonda, and Burt have moved away from the main
               group to another section of the rock outcrop where
               intervening boulders will protect everyone from an explosion.

               Earl has tied a bomb to some nylon rope form one of Burt's
               knapsacks.  Burt places the other bombs safely out of the way
               behind a ledge.  Meanwhile, Val and Rhonda keep throwing
               rocks.  Soon, the ground shifts.

                                          VAL
                            There!  Right straight out in front
                            of you.

               Burt has his coil of fuse.

                                          BURT
                            How much you think?

                                          EARL
                            I don't know...  They're pretty
                            quick...fifteen seconds?

               Burt nods, expertly eyeballing a fifteen second length and
               snipping it off.  As he stuffs it into the bomb:

                                          EARL
                            What the hell is that, anyway?

                                          BURT
                            Cannon fuse.

                                          EARL
                            What do you use it for?

                                          BURT
                                   (matter of fact)
                            My cannon.

               The bomb is ready -- it's moment of truth.  Earl digs in his
               pocket for the lighter -- but Val has it.  Val nervously
               leans over to light the fuse, but then frowns as he sees how
               Earl is holding the rope.

                                          VAL
                            Come on, you're not going to do
                            your lasso thing...?

                                          EARL
                            Hey, just 'cause you're no good
                            with a rope...

               Val shakes his head and lights the fuse.  Earl whirls the
               bomb on the end of its rope like a lasso, and lets it fly out
               as far as he can.  Then he starts pulling it back in along
               the ground like a fishing lure.  Rhonda stares at her watch
               as they all sink down behind the protective boulder.

                                          RHONDA
                            Come on...come on...

                                          BURT
                            Take it...take the bait...

               Suddenly a snout subtly surfaces and gulps down the bomb.  A
               tense two seconds later -- KABOOOM!  Bullseye!  It's a
               volcano of gory creature parts.  They splatter all over!  The
               remaining creatures shriek and race away again.  The people
               cheer wildly.

                                                                    CUT TO:


         168   EXT.  DESERT - ROCK OUTCROP - LATER                          168

               Val, Earl, Rhonda, and Burt prepare to try again.  This time
               Val has the rope and a new bomb.  Rhonda stands by him, ready
               with the lighter.  Earl lobs rocks out into the desert.

                                          EARL
                            Where the hell are they?  Hope they
                            didn't wise up.

                                          RHONDA
                                   (pointing)
                            Nope, there!  That's one.

               Rhonda shakily lights the fuse.  Val heaves the bomb out and
               starts trolling.  The creature swallows it.  Everyone drops
               down behind the boulder, Val impulsively grabbing a second
               bomb. They tense with anticipatory glee -- but the creature
               suddenly spits its bomb back out!  It sails back right over
               their heads.  It strikes the rocks above them, skittering
               down a crevice and landing in -- BURT'S PILE OF BOMBS!

               Val, Earl, and Rhonda scatter.  Burt dives backward over a
               rock ledge.

               BABABAMMM!!  All the bombs explode, throwing rocks every-
               where.  The creatures streak away.  Val, Earl and Rhonda
               sprawl into the dirt, half stunned.

               When the panic is over, Val and Earl realize where they are --
               fifty yards out in open desert!  So is Rhonda, off at an
               angle from them!  Only Burt is safe on the rock outcrop.

               And the creatures are coming back fast!

               The stranded trio starts back for the outcrop, but the
               creatures burst up ahead of them -- one blocking Rhonda's
               path, the other two cutting Val and Earl off!  The creatures
               roar toward their easy prey!

               Val and Earl freeze.  The ground bulges as the creatures
               "skid" to a halt not ten feet from them.  Rhonda stands stock
               still some fifty feet away, eyeing her own creature.

               Over on the outcrop with the main group of people Heather
               sizes up the situation.

                                          HEATHER
                            Make noise.  Everybody!  COME ON!

               Everyone starts hopping up and down, yelling, screaming, and
               clapping.  Burt even runs a few feet out from the rocks,
               firing a pistol into the dirt.

                                          BURT
                            COME ON, YOU SLIMEBAGS!  OVER HERE!
                            FRESH MEAT...!

               The crowd keeps up the ruckus.  The creatures are distracted
               by the noise, but this time they don't automatically go after
               it.  Their big snouts turn uncertainly this way and that.
               But they just stay where they are.  Their hook-tentacles
               slide out, feeling all around.  Earl whispers:

                                          EARL
                            They're not falling for it!

               Heather takes careful aim with her elephant gun.

                                          HEATHER
                            I'll make'em pay attention
                            goddamnit...

               But before she can fire, the creatures mysteriously sink from
               view.  Val, Rhonda, and Earl remain frozen.  What the hell is
               going on?  Nothing happens -- then --

               A HUGE HUMP OF EARTH suddenly wells up near Rhonda.  It sinks
               back down as fast as it appeared.  It's like the creature
               suddenly lifted its whole body almost to the surface then
               submerged again.  Another hump rises and falls right near Val
               and Earl.  There's a pause as the men whisper:

                                          VAL
                            They're...they're trying to make us
                            move!

                                          EARL
                            Or just knock us over.  Look, use
                            the bomb!

                                          VAL
                            It's out last one.  We can't kill
                            them all.

               The creatures try another random "barrage" of humps, some
               coming perilously close.  They know they'll eventually topple
               their prey.  One comes so close to Val and Earl that pebbles
               roll down its sides into their boots!

                                          EARL
                            Use the fucking bomb!

                                          VAL
                            So, we get back on that rock and in
                            three days we're dead anyway.

                                          EARL
                                   (slowly; terrified)
                            I want to live for the three days.

               More humps rise and fall.  Val gives in.  He signals Rhonda,
               gesturing with the bomb.  She understands.  He'll set it off,
               driving away the creatures, and they'll all run back to the
               outcrop.

               Val digs for the lighter.  Doesn't have it.  Earl digs for
               it, too.  But he doesn't have it either!  They go dead pale.
               How can that be?  They look across fifty feet of deadly open
               ground -- trembling Rhonda holds up the lighter!

               Over on the outcrop, Burt shouts:

                                          BURT
                            What's wrong?  Use the bomb, for
                            Godsake!

               Val signals to Rhonda to throw the lighter.  She nods.  But
               just before she does, A HUMP STARTS RISING DIRECTLY UNDER
               HER!  She fights to keep her balance -- struggling to keep
               from taking that single step which will instantly tell the
               creatures where she is.

               But there's no hope.  The hump jerks higher.  Her boots slip
               down the gravelly side!  Instantly the creature twists toward
               her, its hungry mouth erupting out of the dirt.  She screams
               and dashes for Val and Earl.  They run to meet her.  The
               other creatures surface.  The trio is cut off from the rock
               outcrop!

               Val and Earl link up with Rhonda and they all run madly while
               Rhonda tries to light Val's bomb fuse.  But suddenly Val
               yanks the bomb away.

                                          VAL
                            No wait!  This way!

               He veers off in a new direction.  Startled Earl and Rhonda
               have no choice but to follow.  As they desperately try to
               catch up to Val:

                                          EARL
                                   (gasping)
                            What the hell are you doing?!!

                                          VAL
                            I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!

               Earl looks up ahead.  They're headed right for --


         169   EXT.  THE CLIFFS - DAY                                       169

               The massive cliffs.  Earl's eyes bug out.  In seconds they'll
               be right at the brink with nowhere to run.

                                          EARL
                            This better be one great plan!

               As they skid to a stop at the very brink, Val breaks off the
               bomb fuse, leaving only one inch of it.  He whirls to check
               the progress of the advancing creatures.

                                          VAL
                            Get ready!

               He holds the bomb out to Rhonda.  She instantly tries to
               light it.  He grabs her wrist so hard it hurts.

                                          EARL
                            Light it, man!  LIGHT IT!!

                                          VAL
                            Not yet, not yet...

               The charging creatures are almost underfoot.  Finally Val
               pulls Rhonda's hand over to light the fuse.  Instantly he
               hurls the bomb as far as he can, behind the creatures.

                                          EARL
                            Too far!  You threw it behind them!

               The ground opens under their feet!  Tentacles snake toward
               Val and Earl.  A horrid mouth clamps onto Rhonda's boot.  She
               screams as it starts to pull her down.

               WHOOOM!!  The bomb explodes!  The creatures shriek in pain,
               instantly releasing their prey and racing away from the
               painful shock wave in the only direction they can --


         170   EXT.  CLIFFS - WIDE LOW ANGLE - DAY                          170

               Right out through the face of the cliffs!!  The huge,
               shrieking creatures seem to hang in mid-air for a moment,
               their grotesque bodies undulating in pain.  And then they
               fall!  And fall and fall -- a thousand feet!


         171   EXT.  BOTTOM OF CLIFFS - DAY                                 171

               The creatures land on massive jagged rocks, exploding like
               immense, horrid watermelons.  Multi-colored gore festoons the
               whole cliff face.

               TILT UP to see three tiny figures standing at the top of the
               cliff.


         172   EXT.  CLIFFS - DAY                                           172

               Val peers down at the distant creatures for a long time.  Then
               he notices Earl and Rhonda are staring at him.  Where the hell
               did he get an idea like that?  After a moment:

                                          VAL
                            Well, it just suddenly hit me, you
                            know?  Stampede?

               They turn and head back toward the others.  They laugh as
               they realize how stealthily they are walking.  Val starts
               taking big, exaggerated stomping steps.  Rhonda and Earl
               follow suit.  The trio goes off arm in arm, stomping merrily.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:


         173   EXT.  PERFECTION - MAIN STREET - DAY                         173

               Val and Earl roll two scavenged truck wheels down the street
               toward their own truck; which is up on jacks, two wheels
               missing.

               Mindy races past excitedly.

                                          MINDY
                            Look!

               A highway maintenance truck is rolling into town followed by
               a police car.  The townsfolk happily swarm around the
               MAINTENANCE MEN and POLICE OFFICER who gape at the destroyed
               town.

               Val and Earl eagerly start bolting on one of their new wheels.

                                          EARL
                            Road's in!

                                          VAL
                            Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit
                            Bixby we start making phone calls.
                            We could make some real money off
                            this whole thing, get in People
                            magazine...

                                          EARL
                            People?  Hell, National Geographic.

                                          VAL
                            Sell the movie rights.  We're going
                            straight from blue-collar to white
                            -collar.

                                          EARL
                            Yeah...but no ties.

                                          VAL
                            No ties.

               Rhonda pulls up in her truck, leans out and snaps their
               picture with a top-of-the-line Nikon.

                                          RHONDA
                            Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his
                            camera.

                                          EARL
                            Howdy, Rhonda.

                                          RHONDA
                            You're really leaving, huh?

                                          EARL
                            You bet.  You gonna be staying up
                            here?

                                          RHONDA
                            Well, yeah!  There's going to be
                            major research up here.  First
                            thing is to get some pictures of
                            that one we dug up.

               An awkward pause.  Finally she extends her hand to them.  Val
               just gives it a quick shake.

                                          RHONDA (cont'd)
                            Uh...well, maybe I'll see you two
                            sometime...
                                   (to Val)
                            And thanks for everything, you
                            know, saving my life and stuff.

                                          VAL
                                   (awkwardly)
                            Well...you're welcome.

               She gazes at him, just a hint of something in her eyes.  Earl
               springs to attention.  Is the boy blind?  Then Rhonda snaps
               out of it.

                                          RHONDA
                            Well...see ya.

               They nod.  She drives off.  Earl stares at Val who starts
               putting the second wheel on the truck.

                                          EARL
                            Christ, Val, maybe she's not your
                            type, but you could, at least, be
                            civil.

                                          VAL
                            Civil?  I'm civil.

                                          EARL
                            You're not civil, you're glum.  We
                            got the world by the tail with a
                            downhill pull and all of a sudden
                            you go glum on me.

               Earl freezes as a bell goes off in his head.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            Oh my God.  She got to you.  You do
                            like her!

                                          VAL
                            Somebody paying you to do this?

                                          EARL
                            She just practically asked you for
                            a date.  What the hell is wrong?!

               Val glares at Earl for a moment.

                                          VAL
                            Earl, get real.  What does she need
                            with a guy like me?

               Earl is dumbfounded.

                                          EARL
                            What was that?  All this time she's
                            not good enough for you.  Now,
                            suddenly, you're not good enough for
                            her?  God, my work is never done.
                            You don't decide is you're
                            worthless, she does.  But you gotta
                            give her a chance!

               Val lowers the jack letting the truck down.

                                          VAL
                            Earl, I'm not gonna make a fool of
                            myself!  You got that covered.

               Earl stands there fuming, mind racing.  A last ditch idea
               hits home -- we see a devilish glint in his eye.

                                          EARL
                            Fine, make the mistakes I did.
                            I think I'll just be playing this
                            hand myself.

                                          VAL
                            What?

                                          EARL
                            She likes both of us.  We both
                            helped her out.

                                          VAL
                            You are so full of shit...

                                          EARL
                            Oh yeah?  Think about this:  She
                            ain't as narrow-minded as you.
                            I'll lay odds she's looking for
                            character in a man.  For my part,
                            I'd be proud to have her.  I'd
                            goddamn worship her.

               Earl hops into the truck.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            I'm going out there right now, help
                            her take those pictures...set up her
                            seismo-jiggers.  Whatever she
                            wants.  Who the hell knows what'll
                            happen?

               Earl starts to drive off.  Val springs into the passenger
               seat.  Through the truck's rear window we see Val raise his
               hand in The Challenge.  They do a round of scissors-rock-
               paper -- but it's a tie.  They go again.  Another tie.  They
               keep playing and tying as they drive off into the distance
               and we --

                                                                   FADE OUT

                                          THE END
BENEATH PERFECTION

         1     EXT.   DESERT VALLEY - DAY                                   1

               The high desert -- absolutely silent -- a vast, hard land-
               scape stretching away to distant mountains.  The silence is
               broken by hoof-beats.


         2     EXT.  EDGAR'S PLACE - DAY                                    2

               It's a simple cabin dwarfed by a big, ramshackle barn.  EDGAR
               DEEMS (60s), a weathered desert rat of a hermit, is walking
               his donkey around in circles.

               Now, rattling toward them down an endless dirt road, comes an
               old, sun-bleached Buick.  It stops and out leans OLD FRED
               (70s) wearing a sweat-stained fedora.  The two friends nod.

                                          OLD FRED
                            How's she doing?

                                          EDGAR
                            She wants to lay down.  I'm a
                            little worried.

               Old Fred climbs out with a bushel basket of carrots.

                                          OLD FRED
                            Well, I brung her something I know
                            she likes.

                                          EDGAR
                            Damn, Fred, you can't give away all
                            those.

                                          OLD FRED
                            Forget it.  I got vegetables coming
                            out my ears.  Usually the varmints
                            eat up half my crop, but lately I
                            ain't so much as seen a gopher or a
                            jack-rabbit nowheres.

                                          EDGAR
                            If that ain't the truth.  And I
                            count on them for a little bit of
                            stew meat...Thank you, Fred.

               Edgar takes the carrots and feeds one to the donkey.

                                          EDGAR (cont'd)
                            Here you go, Justine.  Look what
                            Fred brought you.

                                          OLD FRED
                            We playing cards tonight?

                                          EDGAR
                            I think I'm gonna be sitting up
                            with her.

                                          OLD FRED
                            I'd do the same.  Well, catch you
                            Thursday.

                                          EDGAR
                            You bet.

               The men nod, and Old Fred drives off.

               CLOSE-UP of the donkey's hooves thumping along as Edgar leads
               her to the barn.

                                          EDGAR (cont'd)
                            Let's get you out of the sun for a
                            spell.

                                          EDGAR (cont'd)
                            I'll get you some fresh water.

               But, suddenly, we hear the donkey restlessly stomping its
               hooves and braying.  Edgar turns, concerned.  Now we hear an
               odd sound.  Distant thunder?  The wind?  The donkey gets more
               and more frantic.

               The barn shudders violently.  Frightened birds explode from
               the eaves.  Dust puffs from every old seam.  Roof shingles
               rain down.  Edgar stares in amazement.

                                          EDGAR (cont'd)
                            ...some kind of earthquake!?

               Then another sound -- the donkey starts screeching in wild
               panic.

                                          EDGAR (cont'd)
                            Justine, hang on! I'm coming!

               Edgar races back to the barn and flings open the doors.


         3     INT.  EDGAR'S BARN - DAY                                     3

               Dust swirls through the air.  But -- the barn in empty.  No
               donkey.  Now Edgar is hit by a ghastly stench.  He staggers
               back, and covers his nose with a handkerchief.  Then he sees,
               splattered across the walls -- blood!

                                          EDGAR
                            What in the name of Jehovah...?

               He raises his arms above the door frame.  When he lowers them
               he's holding a 12 gauge shotgun.  He races outside, ready to
               shoot, but there's nothing -- as far as the eye can see.


         4     EXT.  CLIFFS - DAWN                                          4

               The sun lights up spectacular sheer cliffs which plunge 1000
               feet from a ruggedly beautiful high-desert plateau.  At the
               top of the cliffs, silhouetted against the dawn, a lone cow-
               boy seems to gaze in deep contemplation at the sunrise.  As
               we MOVE IN, we realize he's actually peeing over the cliff.

               This is VALENTINE MCKEE (25).  Smart and good looking, Val
               has nevertheless managed to underachieve brilliantly.  He
               coasts through life, following the path of least resistance
               -- which has brought him to this dubious rustic existence on
               the edge of civilization.  But lately he's beginning to
               wonder why he hasn't accomplished more in his 25 years.

               As a few sleepy cows gaze at him, sleepy Val shuffles over to
               his battered old pickup truck.  A hand-painted sign on the
               door reads: "V & E -- All Type's of Job's."  Indeed, the
               pick-up bed is jumbled with tools and supplies for every
               conceivable odd job -- and the noisily snoring form of his
               partner huddled in a dirty sleeping bag.  Val raps on the
               side of the truck.

                                          VAL
                                   (softly)
                            Good morning, Mr. Bassett, this is
                            your wake-up call.  Please move
                            your fat ass.

               No response from the sleeping bag.  Val stares at the cows
               chewing their cud -- and perks up as he gets an idea.  He
               gently steps onto the truck's running board, then suddenly
               starts jumping up and down as hard as he can, rocking the
               truck violently.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            STAMPEDE!  EARL, GET OUT OF THE
                            WAY!

               The sleeping bag tries to get up and run for it.  It tumbles
               out of the back of the pickup.  While Val laughs uproar-
               iously, EARL BASSET (43) claws his way out of the bag, looks
               around wildly, and finds himself staring at three motionless
               cows.

                                          EARL
                            You dumb shit.

               Earl is a good-ol' boy who has lived his life just like Val,
               drifting from job to job.  He knows why he hasn't accom-
               plished anything, and often tries to impart his hard-won
               wisdom to Val, but the last thing the younger man wants is
               advice.

               Earl stretches.  The men begin a silent ritual:  Earl gropes
               through his pockets for a cigarette, but only finds a
               lighter.  Meanwhile, Val digs in his pockets, coming up with
               cigarettes, but no lighter.  Typical of these two, each guy
               always has half of what he needs.  Eventually they sort it
               out,  trading the necessary implements.

               Earl reaches for a coffee-pot on a battered Coleman stove on
               the tailgate.  But it's cold.

                                          EARL
                            You didn't cook breakfast?

                                          VAL
                            Did it yesterday.  Franks and
                            beans.

                                          EARL
                                   (tries to recall)
                            No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.

                                          VAL
                            Hell you did.  Your turn.

               Earl raises his fist.  This is The Challenge, and it instantly
               triggers the partners' conflict-resolution technique.  They
               solve all disputes using the children's game of "scissors,
               rock, paper."  Earl raises his fist in response.  The game is
               played swiftly and silently -- one, two, three.  On three,
               Val mimes "paper" (open hand.  Earl mimes "scissors" (two
               extended fingers).  Scissors cuts paper.  Val has lost.  He
               shrugs and starts pumping up the stove fuel tank.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Well, when I'm your age I'll
                            probably forget what I eat, too.


         4A    EXT.  DESERT VALLEY - FENCE - DAY                          4A

               Val and Earl are restringing a dilapidated, and seemingly
               endless, barbed wire fence.  A few bored cows watch them.

                                          VAL
                            How many cows does it take to make
                            a stampede?  Is it like three or
                            more?  Is there a minimum speed?

                                          EARL
                                   (shakes his head)
                            I was in one.  A bolt of lightning
                            blew up cottonwood tree.  Three
                            hundred head going hell-bent for
                            the horizon.  Wasn't so damn funny,
                            I can  tell you.

               Earl's hand slips and the fence snags him right through his
               thick glove.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            Ow!  God damn!  Is this a job for
                            intelligent men?!

                                          VAL
                            If there was one nearby I'd
                            probably ask him.

                                          EARL
                            I keep thinking, if we were but
                            half serious about money, we should
                            quit being hired hands and...

                                          VAL
                                   (mock serious)
                            Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.

                                          EARL
                            Whatever the hell we are, we should
                            quit and go get ourselves some real
                            employment.

               Val gestures to the vastness around them.

                                          VAL
                            What, and give up all this personal
                            freedom?


         5     EXT.  JEEP TRAIL - DAY                                       5

               Val guides the truck down a tortuous, rocky, almost impas-
               sable trail.  It takes full concentration as he fights the
               steering wheel, shifts, rides the brake and leans out trying
               to pick a decent route.  Earl braces his feet on the dash and
               munches breakfast, a raw hot dog right out of the package.

                                          VAL
                            Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every
                            year.

                                          EARL
                                   (shrugs)
                            Has a lot of rain.

               Earl pulls a box of Hershey bars from under the seat.  There's
               only one bar left.  He sets the box down between them.  Val
               glances at it -- and raises his fist: The Challenge.  One,
               two, three.  Val mimes "paper;" Earl mimes "rock."  Earl
               loses.  Val takes the bar.

                                          EARL
                                   (pointing ahead)
                            You're gonna get us hung up.

                                          VAL
                            Do not talk to the driver.

               THWONK!  The truck lurches to a stop, its frame caught on a
               big rock.  Val glares at Earl.


         6     EXT. DESERT INTERSECTION - PICK-UP TRUCK - DAY               6

               The pick-up turns from a dirt road onto an old paved road.

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            What do we have next?


         7     INT.  PICK-UP - MOVING - DAY                                 7

               Earl consults a crumpled list pulled from inside his hat.

                                          EARL
                            Uh...Digging that waterhole for
                            Nestor.

                                          VAL
                            Burt and Heather's place is closer.
                            Let's do their kitchen today.  Do
                            Nestor tomorrow.

                                          EARL
                            Nestor's out of town tomorrow.  We
                            don't dig today.  We don't get paid
                            today.  Damn it, Valentine, you
                            never plan ahead.  You never take
                            the long view.  Hell, here it is
                            Monday and I'm already working on
                            Wednesday.
                                   (squints dubiously at
                                    his schedule)
                            It is Monday, right?

               But Val is peering at the desert up ahead.  Off the road a
               ways is a small Toyota pick-up truck and, beside it, a lone
               figure trying to flag them down.

                                          VAL
                            Who the hell's that?  That's not
                            what's his name...the grad student?

                                          EARL
                            Nah, it's September.  Must be the
                            new one.

                                          VAL
                            The new one!  That's supposed to be
                            a girl!

               Earl braces himself, knowing what Val will do.  Val swerves
               the truck wildly off the road, barreling across the desert.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                                   (almost praying)
                            You will have long blonde hair, big
                            green eyes, nice full breasts that
                            stand up and say hello, ass that
                            won't quit.  And legs, legs that go
                            all the way up!

               Earl shakes his head, mildly bemused as they slide to a stop
               in a cloud of dust.


         8     EXT.  DESERT - RHONDA'S TRUCK - DAY                          8

               Val looks out hopefully.  The dust clears.  He sees her --
               RHONDA LeBECK, (25).  Val's eyes do an expert vertical scan:
               short brown hair, small brown eyes, so-so chest, legs hidden
               in baggy dungarees.

               Laden with a portable computer, notebooks, and some
               seismograph printouts, she stares at him through tilted
               glasses.  Her little pick-up truck is loaded with geology
               field equipment.  She shakes Val's hand firmly.

                                          RHONDA
                                   (brightly)
                            Hi, I'm Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.
                            I'm up here for the semester...

                                          VAL
                            Yeah, geography.

                                          RHONDA
                            Right, geology.  And you have to be
                            Val and Earl.  I've heard all about
                            you.

                                          EARL
                            We deny everything.

               Rhonda smiles.

                                          RHONDA
                            Listen, got a question for you.  Do
                            you know if anybody is doing any
                            blasting or drilling or anything
                            like that?

                                          VAL
                            Around here?  Why would they?

                                          RHONDA
                            Well, I'm supposed monitor these
                            seismographs.  You know, they
                            measure vibrations...

                                          VAL
                            Yeah, vibrations in the ground.

                                          RHONDA
                            Yeah, well, I'm getting what I
                            refer to scientifically as "weird
                            vibes."  every sensor I've got is
                            giving me strange readings.  I
                            mean, the school has had these
                            machines up here three years and
                            they've never recorded anything
                            like this.

                                          EARL
                            Well, we'll ask around.  Let you
                            know if we hear of anything.

                                          RHONDA
                            Thanks.  God, I hope they're not
                            screwed up.  I might have to bag
                            the whole semester. Anyway, sorry
                            to bother you.

                                          EARL
                            No problem.  Nice meeting you.
                            Hope you get it sorted out.

               Rhonda unhappily turns back to her equipment as Val and Earl
               drive off.


         9     INT.  PICK-UP TRUCK - MOVING - DAY                           9

               Earl glances over at Val with a gleam in his eye.

                                          EARL
                            You know, if you wanted, we could
                            take a look at those seismographs
                            for her.

                                          VAL
                            What the hell do we know about
                            seismographs?

                                          EARL
                            Nothing.  But it sure might be a
                            nice way of getting to know her.

                                          VAL
                            Why?

                                          EARL
                            Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go
                            for any gal unless she fits that
                            damn list of yours A to Z...

                                          VAL
                            Well, sure.

                                          EARL
                            ...And is dumber than my hind end.
                            Like that Bobby Lynn Dexter...

               Val flips down the truck's sunvisor.  Tapes to it are snap-
               shots of nearly identical blonde bimbos.  Val points to one.



                                          VAL
                                   (defensively)
                            Tammy Lynn Baxter.

                                          EARL
                            Don't matter.  They're all the
                            same: dead weight.  Can't make a
                            decision, can't walk because of
                            their shoes, can't work because of
                            their fingernails.  Make my skin
                            crawl!

                                          VAL
                            Well, I'm a victim of circumstance.

                                          EARL
                            I thought you called it your
                            pecker.  Look, don't make the
                            mistake I made.  Twenty years of
                            looking for a woman exactly like
                            Miss October 1968, and where'd it
                            get me?  Here with you.

               Val rolls his eyes -- "Give me a break."


         10    EXT.  PERFECTION - ESTABLISH - DAY                           10

               The pick-up rattles toward a tiny, utterly isolated high
               desert hamlet -- a few dozen houses and mobile homes fighting
               for shade in the vast landscape.  Its most prominent feature
               is an aging wood-frame water tower, perhaps 25 feet high,
               near the center of town.  A sign PANS into view --
               "PERFECTION -- Pop. 14."


         11    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 11

               Val and Earl head past the water tower for Pham Van's General
               Store, Perfection's main gossip stop and only business.  The
               store's sign, in English and Vietnamese, reads: "Groceries,
               Haircuts, Post Office, Town Hall, VIDEOS!"  Val and Earl park
               next to a camouflage-painted, large-tired Blazer.

               Just then they spot MELVIN, the town's surly teen-aged pain-
               in-the-ass, coming toward them, mindlessly bouncing a
               basketball off the hoods of parked cars.  As he nears their
               truck:

                                          EARL
                            Melvin, touch that truck and die.

                                          MELVIN
                            Oh, man, I'm really shaking.

               But he steers clear of their truck.


         12    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                               12

               Inside, the energetic Vietnamese owner, PHAM VAN, presides
               over his all-purpose establishment: part general store, part
               barber shop, part saloon.

               At the bar are BURT GUMMER and his wife HEATHER, two no-
               nonsense survivalists who have settled in Perfection to await
               the coming apocalypse -- a nice enough couple, but there's a
               hint of paranoia around the edges.  Burt is shoving a box of
               cartridges across to Pham.

                                          BURT
                            No, Pham, they're not hollow
                            points.  I ordered hollow points
                            and that's what I want.

               When Val and Earl enter, Pham automatically pops the tops on
               two cold beers and has them in place before the cowboys reach
               the bar.  Everyone exchanged nods.

                                          HEATHER
                            Hi, guys, what you been up to?

                                          VAL
                            Ran into the new college student,
                            Rona.

                                          EARL
                            Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.  She's
                            getting some kind of strange
                            readings on her things.

                                          BURT
                            Damn, you know, those kids turn up
                            oil or uranium or something out
                            there...next thing the Feds will be
                            at our door.  "Sorry, time to move.
                            Eminent domain."

                                          HEATHER
                            Down, honey, down.

                                          VAL
                            Yeah, Burt.  The way you worry,
                            you're gonna have a heart attack
                            before you get to survive World War
                            III.

               Heather and Pham laugh.  Burt smiles patiently.  Just then
               the compressor in Pham's ice cream freezer comes on.  It's a
               loud chug-chug-chug sound mixed with a high-pitched squeal.

                                          PHAM VAN
                            Hey Val, listen.  Bearing going
                            out, you think?

                                          VAL
                            Could be.

               He starts toward the compressor, but Earl heads him off.

                                          EARL
                            Catch it later, Pham.  Gotta get
                            over to Nestor's.

                                          VAL
                            Right.  We plan ahead.  That way we
                            don't do anything right now.  Earl
                            explained it to me.

               As they turn to go, Val does a take, amazed, as he spots a
               decorative bleached-out cattle skull displayed on the counter
               -- with a $29.95 price tag.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Hey, Pham Van, what the hell is
                            this?

                                          BURT
                            A beauty, isn't it?  We bought three
                            of them for the rec room.

                                          VAL
                                   (whispers to Pham Van)
                            We sell 'em to you for three bucks
                            a piece!

                                          PHAM VAN
                                   (deadpan)
                            And I appreciate it.

                                          VAL
                                   (playfully)
                            You don't get it, Pham.  The idea
                            was: we were ripping you off.

               Suddenly a car alarm blares from outside.  Burt's out the
               door in a flash.  The others follow.


         13    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 13

               Burt races out and shouts at Melvin who back guiltily away
               from Burt's camouflage Blazer.

                                          BURT
                            Melvin, you little pain-in-the-ass!

                                          MELVIN
                            It wasn't me, man!  Your truck's
                            just screwed up, that's all.

               Burt angrily switches off the alarm.  Val and Earl laugh as
               they climb into their truck.

                                          VAL
                            Why don't his parents ever take him
                            to Vegas with them?

                                          EARL
                            You gotta ask that?


         14    EXT.  PIT - DAY                                              14

               At one end of town, Earl maneuvers a huge bulldozer with a
               scoop-loader blade through a choking cloud of dust, scouring
               out a shallow pit to serve as a watering hole.  Val sights
               down a row of stakes which mark one end of the pit.  The job
               is done.  He signals Earl to cut the engine.  Both men have
               kerchiefs covering their faces and are totally encrusted with
               dust.


         15    ANGLE - TRUCK TRAILER - DAY                                  15

               Nearby is an old battered truck trailer -- the massive, solid
               steel kind used for heavy rock hauling.  Tires flat, mired in
               dried mud and weeds, it hasn't been used in years.  Now it
               provides welcome shade as the men sit sipping some coffee.

               NESTOR CUNNINGHAM drives up, surveying the pit with approval.

                                          NESTOR
                            It came out great, boys.  Should
                            fill up just fine come the next
                            rain.  Lemme have your bill.

               Earl and Val start fishing in their pockets for pen and
               paper.  Earl comes up with various pieces of paper, Val with
               three or four pens.  It's a moment before they realize each
               has the other needed implement.  Earl writes out the bill
               during:

                                          NESTOR (cont'd)
                            I'll have to send it to you the
                            first of the month, boys.

               Val and Earl exchange pained looks.

                                          NESTOR (cont'd)
                            Now, you know I'm good for it.

                                          VAL
                            Yeah, Nestor, we know.  Don't worry
                            about it.  Catch us when you can.

               They amble over to their truck.  Earl takes the driver's side
               -- and starts fishing in his pockets for the key.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Are we too easy-going?

                                          EARL
                            No, we're not too easy-going.  This
                            area is economically depressed.

               Val realizes he has the key and hands it over.

                                          VAL
                            So what if we just did it...today.
                            Pack up.  Drive straight down to
                            Bixby.  Get serious.

                                          EARL
                            We could.  We could.  But we'd have
                            to get really serious.  It's gonna
                            cost twice as much to rent a place.

                                          VAL
                            So?  That car wash pays good, and
                            they're always looking.

                                          EARL
                            Car wash?!  That's got no future.
                            If we're gonna take the plunge we
                            oughta have a better plan than
                            that.

                                          VAL
                            Yeah, sure.  Go ahead and plan
                            it...for a year or two.


         16    EXT.  VIOLA'S PLACE - DAY                                    16

               CLOSE ON a stencilled sign: PHAM VAN'S U-RENT -- CESSPOOL,
               SEPTIC TANKS.  PULL OUT to see Val and Earl have rented a
               portable septic pump (perhaps trailer mounted).  The aged
               machine reeks of and drips with its ignoble cargo.  The
               intake hose has been repaired so often it looks to be more
               tape than hose.  Grimacing Val threads the slimy hose down
               through the open top of Viola's cesspool.

               Beside them is Viola's well-kept mobile home on a low hill
               not far from Pham Van's store.  Well-kept flower gardens
               surround the place.  VIOLA, a sweet little old lady, watches
               the men work while straining to hold the leash of her tiny
               but ferocious dog.  The dog yaps continuously, lunging at
               Val and Earl.

                                          VIOLA
                            Stop it!  Stop it, you horrid
                            animal!
                                   (to Val and Earl)
                            I'm going to give her back to my
                            son.  I swear it.

                                          VAL
                            Hey, Viola, you've got my
                            permission.

                                          EARL
                            God almighty, my mama sure didn't
                            raise me for this.

               Val gets up and starts the pump's gas engine.

                                          VAL
                            Well, you're the one won't work in
                            the car wash.  You're the one's
                            gotta have a plan.

                                          EARL
                            Damn it, Val!  Not having a plan is
                            what keeps us doing jobs like this!

               Earl angrily throws the pump valve and starts the pump
               mechanism.  He and Val on stand either side of the intake
               hose as it gurgles happily.

                                          VAL
                            What keeps us doing jobs like this
                            is you dragging your feet.  I was
                            up for going to Bixby.  I was
                            getting excited.

                                          EARL
                            In the past year I must've said a
                            hundred times "We gotta get out of
                            Perfection.  We gotta better
                            ourselves."  You gonna stand there
                            in broad daylight and tell me you
                            think I'm the reason we're still
                            here?  You want to know how close I
                            am to going to Bixby right now?

                                          VAL
                            I'll call that little bluff.  How
                            close?

               POW!  GOOOOSH!  The gurgling intake hose ruptures, showering
               them with -- well you know.  They react as if they'd been
               shot; gagging, staggering, screaming obscenities.


         17    EXT.   VAL AND EARL'S TRAILER - DAY                          17

               Val and Earl's beat-up mobile home is just down the street
               from Pham Van's store.  Val and Earl, now in cleaner clothes,
               march out resolutely.  Val has a portable TV in one hand and
               a framed COORS beer sign in the other.  Earl unhooks the
               clothes line and dumps it, clothes and all, into the back of
               their truck, on top of the rest of their belongings.

               They stare at each other for a moment.  This is it.  No going
               back.  They leap into the truck.  As they drive off, Val leans
               out and yanks their wooden nameplate ("E. Basset -- V. McKee")
               off the mailbox.


         18    EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    18

               They haven't gone fifty yards when they spot NANCY STERNGOOD
               (40s) working in front of her house.  The guys pull their
               hats low over their faces.  Earl swerves to the far side of
               the street.

                                          EARL
                            Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants
                            another load of firewood.

                                          VAL
                            Forget it, man.  It's not worth it.

               Nancy spots them and beckons excitedly.

                                          EARL
                            She's got us.  Now, listen, the
                            plan is: we have done our last job
                            in Perfection.

                                          VAL
                            That's the plan.

               They stop beside Nancy.  While they talk, Nancy's daughter,
               MINDY (9), comes bouncing along on her pogo-stick, listening
               to her Walkman and slowly circling the truck.

                                          NANCY
                            Mindy, honey, don't pogo in the
                            street.  Hey, guys, I've got a job
                            for you...

                                          EARL
                            Sorry, Nancy.  We ain't doing odd
                            jobs anymore.  We're headed for
                            Bixby permanent.

                                          NANCY
                                   (skeptical)
                            Oh, sure...
                                   (sees stuff in back of
                                    truck)
                            ...My God, you really are!

                                          VAL
                            Yep, we're relocating to an area
                            with a greater economic base.
                                   (to Mindy, over her music)
                            Hey, Mindy, what's the count?

                                          MINDY
                            Six hundred three, six hundred
                            four, six hundred five...

                                          VAL
                            Go for it!

                                          NANCY
                            Gee, guys.  I made the big
                            decision.  I'm putting in that
                            satellite dish.  I was going to
                            offer you five hundred dollars.

               Val and Earl glance at each other -- five hundred dollars!


         19    EXT.  DESERT ROAD - PICK-UP TRUCK - DAY                      19

               The truck roars toward the "Leaving Perfection" sign.  Val
               and Earl are elated, downright giddy.

                                          EARL
                            We did it!  We faced temptation and
                            we did not bend!

                                          VAL
                            Damn straight!  Now there's nothing
                            between us and Bixby but nothing!

               They zoom past the sign.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Last time we'll see that sign!

               They laugh, then are thrown half out of their seats as Earl
               accidentally hits a big pothole.

                                          EARL
                            Last time we hit that goddamn
                            pothole!


         20    EXT.  DESERT - WIDE - DAY                                    20

               As the truck streaks across the landscape.  Val and Earl
               merrily continue their good-byes to whatever is visible.

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            So long, cactus!

                                          EARL (V.O.)
                            Adios, bridge!


         21    EXT.  CANYON ROAD - DAY                                      21

               On its way down from the high desert, the lonely road now
               winds through a twisting, narrow canyon.  A county highway
               maintenance truck is parked to one side and two road workers,
               CARMINE and HOWARD, repair a slide-damaged section of the
               road, Carmine breaking up asphalt with a jackhammer.  Val and
               Earl pull up, hand them each a beer, and speed away, shouting:

                                          VAL
                            Last time down this damn twisty
                            road!


         22    EXT.  SHACK - DAY                                            22

               The pick-up speeds past a small shack.  Val and Earl
               automatically roll up their windows.  In a moment we see why:
               a monster, ferocious dog comes galloping out to chase their
               truck.  Earl gives the dog the finger.

                                          EARL
                            Last chance, asshole.  Run, run...!


         23    EXT.  OLD FRED'S PLACE - DAY                                 23

               Old Fred latches the gate on his corral filled with sheep.
               He looks up as Val and Earl's truck speeds past.  Val and Earl
               honk their horn and wave happily.  Old Fred waves back.


         24    EXT.  ROAD - ELECTRICAL TOWERS - DAY                         24

               The pick-up zooms along, the road now paralleling a line of
               tall high-tension electrical towers.


         25    INT./EXT.  PICK-UP TRUCK - MOVING - DAY                      25

               The guys have calmed down, but each is still dreaming of a
               new life.

                                          EARL
                            Okay, here's the plan.  We bust our
                            tails in the car wash six months...
                            well, maybe nine...and we don't
                            spend a dime, you know?  And then
                            we go for it...down payment on a
                            tow-truck or a back-hoe or
                            something, right?  Start a real
                            business.  We can start looking for
                            something today, tonight!

               Val points up ahead -- a man is sitting near the top of a
               distant electrical tower.

                                          VAL
                            Jeez, look at that guy.

                                          EARL
                                   (shakes his head)
                            One job I'd never take is working
                            around electricity.

                                          VAL
                            Especially when it's two hundred
                            feet off the ground.

               But as the pass the tower:

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Hey, hold up...That's Edgar Deems!

                                          EARL
                            You're full of shit.

                                          VAL
                            He's only got one damn jacket.
                            That's him, I'm telling you.


         26    EXT.  ELECTRICAL TOWER - DAY                                 26

               Earl pulls over.  They climb out and peer up at the tower.
               Edgar is hard to see through the criss-crossing girders.

                                          EARL
                                   (impressed)
                            Man, oh, man.  He must've really
                            been drunk this time.
                                   (shouts)
                            Edgar!  What the hell you doing?
                            Get on down from there!

               Edgar doesn't move.  Val and Earl shift about uncomfortably.

                                          VAL
                            Well, shit, we can't leave him up
                            there.

               They stare at each other.  Someone's got to climb up.  Val
               raises his fist in The Challenge.  Their fingers fly.  Rock
               breaks scissors.  Val loses.

               Valentine unhappily climbs the tall tower while Earl watches
               from below.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Hey, Edgar, don't you move.  I'm
                            coming to get you...You damn fool,
                            you owe me on this one...

               Higher and higher Val climbs.  He tries not to look down.

               He's approaching Edgar from below and behind.  As he gets
               nearer he begins to notice forboding details: one of Edgar's
               shoes is missing, half the trouser led is torn off.. Edgar is
               strapped to a girder by his belt, his shotgun gripped in his
               hands.  A swarm of flies buzzes away.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            What the hell...

               He edges around to where he can see Edgar's face -- the
               eyes are wide open, staring.  He's dead.


         27    EXT.  OLD FRED'S PLACE - DAY                                 27

               Old Fred is now hoeing his garden.  He glances up as Val and
               Earl's pick-up roars back toward Perfection.


         28    EXT.  JIM AND MEGAN'S HOUSE - DAY                            28

               A big station wagon is parked between a small mobile home and
               a half-finished house being built by JIM and MEGAN WALLACE,
               an out-going, energetic older couple.  Lumber, cinder blocks,
               and tools are scattered around the yard.

               Jim examines Edgar's body in the bed of Val and Earl's pick-
               up truck.  Val, Earl and Megan talk in subdued tones.

                                          VAL
                            Real sorry to bother you, Megan,
                            but we figured since Jim's a doctor...

                                          MEGAN
                            No, it's fine.  You did the right
                            thing.  When Jim is done we'll call
                            the Coroner's office in Bixby.
                            We'll take care of it.
                                   (shakes her head)
                            Poor Edgar.

                                          EARL
                                   (tries to break the mood)
                            Well, I see you got all the
                            wallboard up.

                                          MEGAN
                            That was easy.  You two did the
                            hard part.  Sure sorry you're
                            leaving.

               Jim climbs out of the pick-up.

                                          EARL
                            Was is a heart attack?

                                          JIM
                                   (shaking his head)
                            He died of dehydration.  Thirst.

                                          VAL
                            But that doesn't make sense.  That
                            takes a couple of days, doesn't it?

                                          JIM
                            Three or four even.

                                          EARL
                            You mean he sat up there three or
                            four days?  Just sat there till he
                            died of thirst?

               Jim shrugs.  Everyone is mystified.


         29    EXT.  OLD FRED'S PLACE - DAY                                 29

               Fred is still hoeing.  In the nearby pen his sheep start
               acting restless.  He eyes them.  What's up?  We hear a
               strange muffled sound.  Unseen, behind him, at the far end of
               the garden, his scarecrow mysteriously tilts.

               Old Fred keeps hoeing.  He stops, his foot is caught in the
               dirt.  Suddenly he is yanked knee-deep into the ground!


         30    EXT.  CANYON ROAD - DAY                                      30

               Val and Earl's truck, again headed for Bixby, and going way
               too fast, zooms past the two workers still repairing the
               road.  The workers glance up, annoyed.


         31    EXT.  SHACK - DAY                                            31

               Val and Earl, sobered and deep in thought, drive past the
               shack where the ferocious dog lives.  They automatically roll
               up their windows during:

                                          EARL
                            Reckon he hated Perfection more
                            than us?  You suppose he wanted to
                            kill himself?

                                          VAL
                            If he did, why didn't he use his
                            damn shotgun?

                                          EARL
                            Maybe he just couldn't pull the
                            trigger...

                                          VAL
                            Oh sure, he figured it was easier
                            to die of thirst?  Come on,
                            sombody must've chased him up
                            there.

                                          EARL
                            Oh, you mean somebody who ain't
                            scared of a twelve gauge shotgun.
                            And then what did they do?  Camp
                            out down below and just wait for
                            him to die?

               Val has no answer.  It's too weird.

                                          VAL
                            Well, whatever the hell happened
                            it's just one more goddamn good
                            reason to haul ass out of this
                            place.

                                          EARL
                            You got that right.

               They are passing the shack.  Earl suddenly realizes:

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            Hey, where the hell's that asshole
                            dog?

                                          VAL
                                   (looking around)
                            Probably up a pole starving itself
                            to death.

                                          EARL
                            Okay, the plan is: pedal to the
                            metal the whole way.  We don't stop
                            till we hit the carwash, not even
                            to pee.

                                          VAL
                            I'll go with that plan.


         32    EXT.  OLD FRED'S PLACE - DAY                                 32

               CLOSE ON the pick-up's tires skidding to a stop.  PULL OUT to
               see we're back at Old Fred's.

                                          VAL
                            What are you doing?

               Earl is staring wide-eyed.  Val follows Earl's gaze and is
               aghast when he sees --

               The sheep pen -- it's a ghastly, bloody mess.  Scattered on
               the churned up ground a few dismembered sheep legs and heads
               are all that remain of the flock.

                                          VAL
                                   (whispers)
                            What the hell...?

               Val and Earl leap out of the truck to investigate.

                                          VAL
                            Hey, Old Fred!  Fred!  Where are
                            you?!

               Earl dashes into Fred's house.  Val checks around outside.
               Earl comes back out.

                                          EARL
                            Not here.

               Then they spot something lying in the middle of the garden --
               Old Fred's hat.

               Still looking all around, Val squats distractedly to pick up
               the hat.  He and Earl stumble backward in shock.

               OLD FRED IS STILL WEARING HIS HAT!!  His mangled face stares
               up at them, eyes and mouth frozen open in a death grimace.

                                          EARL
                            Oh, Jesus!!

                                          VAL
                            What the hell is going on?  I mean
                            WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?!!


         33    EXT. CANYON ROAD - DAY                                       33

               Carmine and Howard continue repairing the road, Carmine still
               using the noisy jackhammer.  Val and Earl drive up.

                                          EARL
                            You guys better get the hell outta
                            here!  We got a killer on the loose!

                                          HOWARD
                            What?

               Carmine stops jackhammering to listen.

                                          EARL
                            A murderer, man!  A real psycho.
                            He's cutting people's heads off!
                            I'm serious!  I'd high-tail for
                            town if I was you!

               Val and Earl speed away.

                                          CARMINE
                            They're drunk.

                                          HOWARD
                            Yeah...

               But he edges over to the truck and takes out a heavy steel
               pry-bar to keep within easy reach.

               Carmine goes back to work, pounding the asphalt with the
               jackhammer.  Suddenly the blade strikes something beneath the
               road, something soft.  We hear a strange, unearthly shriek
               from underground.  A weird orange goo gushes up around the
               blade.  Then the jackhammer takes off by itself like a
               harpoon stuck in a whale!  Carmine gets tangled in the jack-
               hammer's air-hose and is dragged along, shouting for help.

               Howard chases him down the embankment and into the scrub-
               brush.  He hears Carmine screaming.

                                          HOWARD
                            Carmine!  What the hell is it?!
                            Where are you?

               But now there is only silence.  Howard crashes through the
               brush.  All he finds is the torn end of the air-hose -- which
               suddenly sucks down into the ground.  He's momentarily
               staggered by an awful smell, but forces himself to keep
               looking.  He lets the pry-bar drag on the ground.  Then
               something -- it looks like a mouth or a horrid beak -- shoots
               out of the ground and grips the pry-bar with uncanny
               strength!  Howard drops his weapon and scrambles madly away.

               He clambers back onto the road.  But almost immediately
               cracks form in the pavement around him.  More beak-things
               break through the asphalt between him and his truck.

               He dashes across the road, scrambling up the embankment.  He
               clings precariously to a tree root, looking down -- where'd
               they go?  Suddenly the dirt around him begins to "bubble."
               Several hungry beaks break through and grab him, yanking him
               head first into the embankment.  Then the embankment gives
               way, crashing down onto the road, taking with it a nearby
               telephone pole and snapping the lines.


         34    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 34

               Pham Van is talking to MIGUEL, a local rancher.  They both
               jump as the doors burst open.  Val and Earl race in, trailed
               by Nestor and Melvin.  Val heads for the payphone during:

                                          NESTOR
                            His head?  You mean just his head?

               Val grabs the phone and digs in his pocket for change.

                                          VAL
                            Yeah, really sick, man.  Sweet Old
                            Fred.

               Earl comes up with change and hands it to Val, who dials.

                                          PHAM VAN
                            Something happen to Fred?

                                          MELVIN
                                   (ignoring Pham)
                            Are you serious, man?  They killed
                            him just to take his sheep?

                                          EARL
                            He didn't have nothing else to
                            steal.  Neither did Edgar.

                                          MIGUEL
                            What happened to Edgar?

               Val stares at the phone.

                                          VAL
                            I don't believe this.  The phone is
                            out!  Pham, your phone is out!

                                          PHAM VAN
                            I didn't do it!  What's going on?

               Val and Earl rush out.


         35    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 35

               Trailed by the others Val and Earl march out and leap into
               their truck , Val driving now.  He searches for the key.

                                          NESTOR
                            We've gotta get the police up here.
                            You guys gotta step on it to Bixby.

               Earl hands Val the key.

                                          VAL
                            Consider it stepped on.


         36    EXT.  CANYON ROAD - DAY                                      36

               Again the pick-up barrels through the canyon.

                                          VAL
                            Brother, we decided to leave this
                            place just one day too late, you
                            know?

                                          EARL
                                   (grimly)
                            Well, there's sure as hell nothing
                            to stop us now.  Everybody we know
                            between here and Bixby is already
                            dead.

               Earl points ahead and screams:

                                          EARL
                            LOOK OUT!!

               Val brings the truck to a squealing stop.  Ahead: the
               collapsed embankment completely blocks the road.  It's
               totally impassable.  The cowboys are dumbfounded.

                                          EARL
                            Is some higher force at work, here?
                            Are we asking too much of life?

               But Val is in no mood for philosophy.  He leaps out and peers
               into the highway maintenance truck which sits undisturbed,
               emergency lights still flashing.  There's nobody in it.  He
               starts looking around.

                                          VAL
                            Those assholes are supposed to be
                            fixing the goddamn road!
                                   (shouts)
                            Hey!  Where are you guys?  People
                            gotta use this road, you know!
                            You on a booze break or what?!

                                          EARL
                                   (whispers; urgently pointing)
                            Val!  Val!

               Val looks where he's pointing -- Howard's bloodstained
               hardhat lies at the edge of the landslide.  Val gets the
               point.  Looking around for the unknown assailant, he eases
               back into the truck.  Earl already has a pistol in his lap
               and is digging through the glove compartment.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            Where are the bullets?  Don't we
                            have any goddamn bullets?

               Val quickly jockeys the truck to turn it around on the narrow
               road.  But as he backs into the hillside, we hear a strange
               grating clunk from underneath.  When he tries to pull
               forward, the truck won't move.  The engine stalls.

                                          VAL
                            Jesus!  I don't believe this!

                                          EARL
                            You're hung up again.

                                          VAL
                            I am not!

               They both lean out.  The rear tires are clear.  Val restarts
               the truck and tries to pull forward, rocking the truck
               against some unseen pull.  Smoke wells up from the clutch.

                                          EARL
                            You're hung up I tell you.  You're
                            gonna burn the clutch.

               Val slams the truck into low-range four-wheel-drive and revs
               it.  The tires dig in, fighting for traction -- and suddenly
               the truck lurches free.  We hear an eerie shriek mingled with
               gear and engine noise as Val angrily roars away.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            Jesus, you can break an axle like
                            that.

                                          VAL
                            Fuck you!

                                          EARL
                            Hey, I don't want spend the night
                            out here!


         37    EXT.  PHAN VAM'S STORE - DAY                                 37

               The word has spread.  Everybody in town is gathered at Pham
               Van's.  They rush out to meet Val and Earl as they drive up.

                                          BURT
                            What the hell you doing back
                            already?

                                          VAL
                            You're never going to believe this,
                            but the canyon road...we were on it
                            not two hours ago...well, it's
                            completely...

               But he stops because they're all staring wide-eyed at the
               rear of the truck.

                                          NANCY
                            My God...!

               Val and Earl jump out and look where everyone else is
               looking.  Their jaws drop.  REVEAL: hanging from the rear
               axle of their truck and trailing out behind like a nightmare
               wedding decoration -- a sex foot long, grotesque, fleshy,
               tentacle.  The end gripping the axle looks like a vicious,
               razor-sharp beak or hook.  The trailing end is mutilated,
               oozing orange goo -- as though the creature was torn in half.



                                          MELVIN
                            Unreal!  Where'd you get it?

                                          VAL
                            Uh...didn't know we had it...

                                          NANCY
                            It's disgusting.

                                          VIOLA
                            Looks like...and eel.

                                          NESTOR
                            Naw...eels live in water.

                                          VAL
                            So...it's some kind of snake?

                                          EARL
                            Or a big mother slug maybe?

                                          BURT
                            Some kind of mutation...?

               Burt, more daring than the others, pries the thing off the
               axle with a shovel.

                                          PHAM VAN
                            Don't touch, don't touch.

                                          BURT
                            It's dead all right.  Tore the damn
                            thing in half.

                                          EARL
                            It must've grabbed us.  That's why
                            the truck stalled-out.

                                          VAL
                                   (suddenly indignant)
                            Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not
                            hung up...!

                                          BURT
                            Stalled out your truck?  Have to be
                            one strong son of a bitch.

               Pham Van leaps over them.

                                          PHAM VAN
                            I give you boys five dollars for
                            it.

               Val and Earl square their shoulders.  This time they're ready
               for him.

                                          VAL
                            Twenty.

                                          PHAM VAN
                            Okay, ten dollars.

                                          EARL
                            Fifteen.

                                          PHAM VAN
                            Okay, fifteen.

                                          VAL
                            Damn right fifteen.

               Burt is deep in thought.

                                          BURT
                            Just one of these couldn't eat up
                            off a whole flock of sheep.
                            There's gotta be more out there, a
                            lot more.

               A cold chill spreads through the group.  They stare out at
               the vast, forbidding desert.  They suddenly feel alone --
               very alone.


         38    EXT.  DESERT - DAY                                           38

               CLOSE on Rhonda's hat lying on the ground.  We think the
               worst.  Then she reaches in, picks it up and puts it on.
               REVEAL she's in a lonely corner of the valley working with a
               seismograph.  She pounds a marking stake into the dirt.


         39    INSERT - CLOSE ON SEISMOGRAPH                                39

               The needle responds to each blow on the stake.  We hear
               Rhonda stop pounding.  The needle stops.  All is silent --
               but the needle starts moving again!"


         40    BACK TO SCENE                                                40

               LOW CAMERA is MOVING in Rhonda's general direction.  She
               starts to pound another stake.  CAMERA REACTS so it is moving
               straight toward her.  As it passes a burrow, a rabbit
               suddenly scouts out.  CAMERA WHIP PANS to watch the rabbit
               scamper into the distance, then TURNS BACK to move toward
               Rhonda, who still pounding her stake.

               CAMERA passes Rhonda's seismograph.  The machine tilts
               slightly as the ground bulges up beneath it.

               Rhonda finishes pounding.  She heads for her truck, noisily
               tossing in her tools and slamming the tailgate.  CAMERA
               CLOSES IN on her, faster and faster.  It is right on her
               heels as she climbs into the cab!


         41    ANGLE - RHONDA'S TRUCK                                       41

               A beak-thing thrusts out of the ground, groping where
               Rhonda's boot just was.  Rhonda drives off, unknowingly
               running right over the thing.  We hear a shriek of pain as
               the tentacle writhes and sucks back under the ground.


         42    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - NIGHT                               42

               Mindy Sterngood poses cautiously with the bizarre hook
               tentacle.   A camera FLASHES and we REVEAL Pham Van taking
               her photo beside a sign: "Photographs -- You and the Snake
               Monster -- $2.00."  Viola and Miguel, wait in line.

               We now see the store is crowded with concerned townsfolk
               debating what to do, and how to protect themselves.  Val and
               Earl sit on the sidelines, sipping beer, gazing in awe at
               enterprising Phan Vam:

                                          EARL
                            Slick as snot and I'm not lying.

                                          VAL
                            Fifteen lousy bucks.

                            A man who plans ahead.

               Dominating the discussion are Burt and Heather now armed with
               scoped, magnum hunting rifles.  Heather stands guard at a
               window, peering out into the night.

                                          BURT
                                   (to group)
                            ...Look, we organize, we arm
                            ourselves.  We go out, we find
                            those damn snake things, we make
                            'em extinct.

                                          NESTOR
                            Come on, Burt, we don't even know
                            what they are.

                                          BURT
                            Miguel, the trouble's come to us.
                            If we're not ready...

                                          HEATHER
                            Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on
                            our own.

                            And you two just love it, don't you?

                                          HEATHER
                            Come on, Nancy, don't let's get
                            personal.  We need to do something.

               Burt steps over to a faded topographic map on the wall and
               points out details during:

                                          BURT
                            Damn right.  You folks gotta
                            analyze the situation.  With that
                            road out we're completely cut off.
                            Got the cliffs to the north,
                            mountains east and west.  That's
                            why Heather and me settled here in
                            the first place, geographic
                            isolation.

                                          NANCY
                            Well...there must be dome way to
                            get help.

                                          VIOLA
                            Yes, that's what I say.

                                          BURT
                            How, for chrissake?  You gonna walk
                            thirty-eight miles to Bixby?

                                          MIGUEL
                            Hey, what about Pham Van's saddle
                            horses?

               All heads turn toward Pham Van.

                                          PHAM VAN
                            You're welcome to them.  Does
                            anybody know how to ride?

               All heads turn toward Val and Earl.


         43    EXT.  JIM AND MEGANS'S HOUSE - ESTABLISH - NIGHT             43

               In the vast desert night a single floodlight illuminates Jim
               and Megan's partially finished house.  Their station wagon is
               parked out front.  A country and western tune drifts to us
               from it's radio.

               As we MOVE CLOSER, we see the floodlight is powered by a
               small, softly purring generator set maybe fifty feet away.

               Jim and Megan, both exhausted, unload a big stack of roofing
               shingles from their station wagon.  Jim starts to lift a
               package of shingles but gives up and sits on the tailgate.

                                          JIM
                            I'm dead.  Let's finish in the
                            morning.

                                          MEGAN
                            We have to go into Bixby in the
                            morning.
                                   (grins devilishly)
                            The concrete blocks are in.

                                          JIM
                            The con...!  Oh my God.

                                          MEGAN
                            Just keep looking at that beautiful
                            sky.

                                          JIM
                            What?

                                          MEGAN
                            That's the sky that's going to be
                            over our roof every night, when
                            we're done.

                                          JIM
                                   (joking)
                            Ah, but consider this, if we don't
                            finish the roof, we can looks at
                            that sky all the time.

               Just then the whirring of the generator becomes strangely
               muffled.  The floodlight flickers.  Now the generator dies.
               Darkness engulfs them.  The car radio music drones on
               incongruously.

                                          JIM (cont'd)
                            Damn that thing!

                                          MEGAN
                                   (sarcastic)
                            We could always buy a new
                            generator.

               Jim digs out a powerful flashlight and heads over toward the
               generator.  Megan lies back, taking a welcome breather.
               After a moment:

                                          MEGAN
                            Well, what's wrong with it?

                                          JIM (V.O.)
                            It's...gone...!


         44    ANGLE - JIM                                                  44

               Baffled, he sweeps the whole area with the flashlight.  Megan
               joins him.

                                          MEGAN
                            You sure this is where it was?

                                          JIM
                            Am I sure?!
                                   (points with flashlight)
                            It was right there.  There's the
                            cord.

               The severed electric cable stops at the edge of a cone-shaped
               depression in the dirt where the generator sat.  He hands her
               the flashlight and kneels.  We watch tensely as he probes the
               loose earth with his hands.

                                          JIM (cont'd)
                            Maybe the ground caved in.  There's
                            a lot of old mines and stuff around
                            here.

               Megan grabs his shirt, trying to pull him back.

                                          MEGAN
                            Well don't then!  You don't want to
                            fall in.

               Suddenly, about ten feet away -- WHOOMP!!  The generator
               shoots up out of the ground!  Jim and Megan dive for cover as
               it sails through the air, and crashes to earth.  They stare,
               transfixed.  The generator is dented and bent almost beyond
               recognition -- and covered with oozing slime.

                                          JIM
                            What the...?

               But Megan is all action.  She yanks him back.

                                          MEGAN
                            Come on.  Get away from it!

                                          JIM
                            God, what a stink!

               We again hear that mysterious rumbling sound.  Jim stops,
               sweeping the flashlight around them.

                                          JIM (cont'd)
                            Hear that?

                                          MEGAN
                            Never mind!  Let's go!  Let's just
                            go into town or something!  Jim,
                            please!

               She hustles him bodily toward the car during:

                                          JIM
                            You know, I bet it's geological or
                            something, like natural gas, or a
                            geyser.  They stink like that.
                            Remember in Yellowstone...?

               Suddenly he drops knee-deep into ground!  Megan is thrown
               off balance and tumbles to one side.  The flashlight falls,
               lighting them at an eerie low angle.

                                          JIM (cont'd)
                            Something's got me!!

               We hear sickening CRUNCHES from below the earth.  He SCREAMS
               in excruciating agony.

                                          JIM (cont'd)
                            Oh, God!  Get me Out!!  GET ME OUT!!

               He struggles wildly, but just sinks further down!  Megan
               slides a 2X4 over to Jim.  He grabs it like a drowning man,
               trying to keep himself from being pulled down.  But he's
               pulled with suck power the 2X4 snaps!

               His head is going under.  Megan desperately tries to dig the
               smothering earth away, but she's losing.  Now only his arms
               are above ground.  She pulls with all her might, but he sinks
               inexorably down, down.  She's pulled flat on the ground.
               He's gone.

               The next instant, a vicious hook-tentacle erupts through the
               earth, missing Megan's face by inches.  She scrambles back
               frantically.


         45    ANGLE - STATION WAGON                                        45

               LOW CAMERA pursues Megan toward the car, just missing her as
               she dives in through the open tailgate.  She slams it after
               her.  The talons rake across the car, scratching the glass.

               Megan tumbles into the front seat.  Thank God the keys are in
               the ignition.  She starts the engine.  But outside the "snake
               things" attack the car in a frenzy, slashing blindly.  A rear
               tire is totally shredded just as:

               Megan floors it.  The car lurches forward but the mutilated
               tire falls apart.  The wheel rim digs into the loose earth
               and the car is stuck.  With no other recourse, Megan locks
               the door, rolls up the windows and cowers in the middle of
               the car, panting, sobbing.  The radio is still playing a
               happy cowboy tune.  She peeks out.  They gave up?  She's
               safe?  Nothing happens for a moment, then --

               The car starts to shake and shudder!  Dust wells up around the
               windows.

               Outside we see a bizarre sight.  The earth around the rear of
               the car is "boiling," dirt flying in all directions -- and
               the car starts to sink into the ground!!

               Megan wildly honks the horn!  The car looks just like a ship
               going down by the stern, hood tilting up gracefully.  The
               back windows shatter, dirt pouring in!  Megan smashes the
               windshield with a small fire extinguisher and scrambles out
               on the hood.  But there's no hope.  The car keeps sinking,
               titling now almost ninety degrees, forcing her onto a
               precarious perch on the grille -- sinking, sinking.

               Out of her mind with terror, she keeps softly murmuring the
               same hopeless phrases:

                                          MEGAN
                            Stop it!  Stop it!  Somebody stop it...!


         46    EXT.  DESERT - JIM AND MEGAN'S HOUSE - VERY WIDE - NIGHT     46

               The headlights are two ironic beacons sending their beams
               skyward through the roiling dust into the night sky.  The
               sound of the radio becomes muffled.  The headlights sink from
               view -- and then Megan's scream floats across the desert.


         47    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAWN                                47

               Out front of Pham Van's, nervous Val and Earl saddle up the
               horses while Pham loads their saddle bags with food.  Every-
               one has gathered to see them off.  There's an air of tension.

                                          VAL
                                   (eyeing the horses)
                            Pham, we don't want to be stuck on
                            a couple of canners.  They better
                            be fast.

                                          EARL
                            Relax.  A snake thing like that
                            couldn't move too quick.

                                          VAL
                            Screw you.  For all you know they
                            could fly.

               Earl pulls their old Smith and Wesson revolver and battered
               Winchester rifle out of the pick-up truck.

                                          EARL
                            You want the rifle or the Smith?

                                          VAL
                                   (definite)
                            The rifle.

               So does Earl.  He raises his hand.  They swiftly do a round
               of scissors-rock-paper.  Earl loses.  He hands Val the rifle.
               Just then, Burt and Heather pull up in their Blazer, climbing
               out with their hunting rifles.

                                          BURT
                            You guys all set?

                                          EARL
                            Ready as we'll ever be.

                                          BURT
                            Heather and I are going to drive
                            around a little, see if we can find
                            that college girl and tell her to
                            get her ass back into town.

                                          VAL
                            Good idea.  And we'll swing by the
                            doctor's place.  They were going to
                            go into Bixby but we don't know if
                            they left before the road was out.

               Val and Earl mount up.

                                          HEATHER
                            Hold on.  You guys oughta take
                            something that packs more punch
                            than that thirty-thirty.  Take one
                            of our Browning autos, or even my
                            model seventy...
                                   (offers her hunting rifle)
                            It's three-seventy-five H and H
                            mag.

               Earl takes the awesome-looking gun with a smug glance at Val.

                                          EARL
                            Gee...thanks, Heather.  Hope we
                            don't need it.

               Heather unhooks a box of cartridges from her belt and hands
               it to Earl.  Suddenly there's a blood-curdling SCREAM!  The
               door to Pham Van's flies open.  Out staggers Melvin, wrapped
               in Pham Van's hook-tentacle, writhing in apparent agony.

                                          MELVIN
                            IT'S GOT ME!  IT's GOT ME!  AAAAHGH!

               People scatter like sheep.  Burt and Heather have guns
               trained on him in an instant.  Then everyone realizes it's a
               sick joke.  Melvin collapses with laughter.  Burt is livid.
               He almost shot Melvin.  He charges over and yanks the kid to
               his feet, screaming:

                                          BURT
                            You stupid punk!  You came that
                            close, that close!!

                                          EARL
                            One of these days, Melvin,
                            somebody's gonna kick your ass.

               Pham rushes over and grabs his precious tentacle.  As people
               calm down, Val and Earl gaze nervously at the vast desert
               before them.

                                          BURT
                            Well...you fellas watch yourselves.

                                          NANCY
                            Come back with the Sheriff.

                                          NESTOR
                            Sheriff, like hell.  Come back with
                            the National Guard.

               They ride out to an adlib chorus:  "Keep your heads down;"
               "Go careful, boys;" "Keep a sharp lookout;" etc.


         48    EXT.  DESERT - DAY                                           48

               Val and Earl ride along, very tiny in the vast, lonely
               landscape, and very on edge.  Constantly looking all around.

                                          EARL
                            You know, we can't possibly make
                            Bixby by nightfall.

               Val doesn't want to hear it.

                                          EARL
                            That means we're gonna be out here,
                            like, in the dark.

                                          VAL
                                   (resentfully)
                            Great.  Thank you.

               Faint Country and Western radio music drifts to them.
               They're nearing Jim and Megan's house.


         49    EXT.  JIM AND MEGAN'S HOUSE - DAY                            49

               Val knocks on the door to the mobile home.

                                          VAL
                            Hey, doctor, anybody here?

               No answer.  He opens the door and peers inside.  Behind him
               Earl steps out of the half-finished house and shrugs.  Nobody
               around.  Wind rustles the plastic sheeting over the windows.
               Strangely they can still hear the muffled radio clearly.

                                          VAL
                                   (spooked)
                            Oh, man, I hate this shit.

               They walk briskly to their horses.  Earl snatches Heather's
               rifle from its saddle scabbard.  Val pulls out the
               Winchester.  Earl tries to reassure himself.

                                          EARL
                            Car's gone.  We just missed them,
                            that's all.

                                          VAL
                            Then where's the goddamn Conway
                            Twitty coming from?

               They focus on the sound and walk gingerly toward it, keeping
               constant watch in every direction.  The ground here is all
               torn up like the sheep pen -- and the music is coming from
               underneath!  What the hell is going on?

               Val scrapes at the dirt with his boot -- and finds the
               headlight of Jim and Megan's station wagon, still on, glaring
               up at him.  He drops down and wildly sweeps away more dirt,
               revealing more of the car's grille and hood -- and blood -
               soaked dirt which sticks to his hand.  He leaps away,
               frantically rubbing the blood off on his pants.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Oh, man...oh, man...


         50    EXT.  DESERT - CONCRETE DITCH - DAY                          50

               Val and Earl are riding at full gallop.  They race alongside
               a concrete-lined flood-control ditch and veer off to follow a
               barbed wire fence which crosses the ditch.


         51    EXT.  DESERT - BARBED WIRE FENCE - DAY                       51

               They ride along the fence during:

                                          EARL
                            Here's the plan...We don't even
                            stop.  Ride like hell.  Tonight we
                            keep right on going.  We'll walk
                            the horses.

                                          VAL
                            That is the plan...I mean, goddamn
                            it!  What the hell are those
                            things?  How could they bury an
                            entire Plymouth station wagon?

                                          EARL
                            Why would they do it?

               Suddenly the horses stop short.  In a frenzy they wheel
               around, rear up, refusing to go on.  The cowboys fight to
               control them.

                                          VAL
                            I knew it!  Pham Van wouldn't know
                            a decent horse if...!

               But Earl's already drawing his rifle.

                                          EARL
                            Shut up!  They got wind of
                            something they don't like!

                                          VAL
                            Oh shit!

               He draws his rifle.  They look wildly in all directions at
               once -- but there's nothing, only empty desert.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            But I don't see anything!

               They keep staring.  The horses keep pacing nervously.  Then
               -- Earl's horse rears wildly and falls!  Earl goes flying.
               Val wheels around wildly, dismounts and runs to Earl, who's
               bruised and winded but basically unhurt.  They think Earl's
               horse just tripped.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Hey, you okay?  You okay?

                                          EARL
                            Yeah...yeah.
                                   (turning to the horse)
                            What about the hor...?

               Their eyes bulge.  Several "snake things" have engulfed the
               horse's head, sucking, crushing, slurping.  Val's horse goes
               berserk and gallops for the horizon.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            What in the name...?

                                          VAL
                            That's how they get you!  They're
                            under the goddamn ground!

               Suddenly they realize what that means -- the thing could
               come up under them!!  The cowboys scramble frantically away.
               But nothing pursues them.  They pause, glancing back
               nervously.

                                          EARL
                            What the hell are they?

                                          VAL
                            Sons of bitches!

               Val raises his rifle and takes a well-aimed shot, hitting one
               of them.  Orange goo spurts out.  We hear a deafening shriek
               as all the "snake things" instantly zip back underground.

               Then -- A HUGE MOUND OF EARTH RISES UP UNDER VAL AND EARL!!
               The cowboys tumble down its side, Val losing his rifle.  They
               roll over and stare dumbfounded at the mound.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                                   (gasps)
                            There must be a million of them!!

               The mound of earth turns toward them.  The ground splits open
               and out rises -- a huge head!

                                          EARL
                                   (awestruck)
                            Nope...just one.

               The monster is a horrendous thirty-foot long eating machine!
               Its head is eyeless, utterly alien, covered with tough boney
               plates which close together to form a cork-screw point.

               The cowboys stumble back toward the fence in speechless
               terror.  The creature slides toward them, pushing through the
               earth like a whale through water.  Now it opens its mouth --
               but it's like a grotesque flower, boney plates spreading open
               like petals, revealing a huge, slimy, fleshy, oozing orifice!
               And inside the mouth, a ghastly multi-tentacled tongue!
               These are the "snake things," not snakes at all but actually
               the horrid hook-tentacles that can shoot out six feet to snag
               their prey!

               The monster snorts and snuffs, throwing up plumes of dust,
               sounding like a horrendous pig.  It sinks into the earth and
               charges!  We see the hump of earth move toward them faster
               and faster but then it disappears as the creature goes deeper.

               Val and Earl leap sideways and run along the fence.  The
               creature goes straight and slams into a fencepost from below.
               All we see is the fencepost knocked at a crazy angle.

               The cowboys keep running.  The creature regroups and charges
               after them, hitting each fencepost in turn, sending weird
               sinuous shock waves along the barbed wire, making almost
               musical twanging sounds.  Val looks back.

                                          VAL
                            It's gaining on us!!

               And as if that weren't enough, Earl points to more trouble
               ahead.


         52    EXT.   CONCRETE DITCH - DAY                                  52

               The fence runs straight to the edge of the ditch, an eight
               foot wide gap yawning dead ahead.  The creature churns like
               a locomotive from behind.  They'll have to try to jump!  They
               strain desperately for every last fraction of speed.

                                          EARL
                            We can do it, we can do it!

               They leap and -- they don't do it!!  They smack into the
               opposite side of the ditch, clawing frantically at the lip,
               only to tumble to its sloping bottom.  A split second later
               the charging creature slams like a wrecking ball into the
               foot-thick concrete wall!  The wall CRACKS AND BULGES OUT!  A
               hook-tentacle flops out through one of the cracks!  Terrified
               Val and Earl scramble away.  But the wall holds together.

               And the, strangely, all is quiet.  The tentacle lays dead
               still.  Eventually, the cowering cowboys dare to creep back a
               little closer, still panting, exhausted, jumpy.

                                          EARL
                            Stupid son of a bitch...knocked
                            itself cold.

               And now orange slime begins to ooze through the cracks in the
               concrete.

                                          VAL
                            Cold, my ass!  It's dead!  We
                            killed the bastard!

               He suddenly shakes his fist at the dead beast.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            You FUCKER!!

               They allow themselves a small wheeze of nervous laughter,
               only to jump like rabbits as some pebbles rattle loudly down
               the concrete wall behind them.  They whirl to see Rhonda, up
               on the opposite side of the ditch, staring down at them.
               She's lugging a bunch of her equipment, including a small
               folding shovel.

                                          RHONDA
                            Hi, guys, how're you doing?  Look,
                            can I ask you something?  Did you
                            just notice something weird?
                            Vibrations?  You know, some kind of
                            earth tremor?

               Val and Earl look at each other, then burst out laughing.
               Rhonda spots the cracked wall.

                                          RHONDA (cont'd)
                            What's that?


         53    EXT.   CONCRETE DITCH - DAY                                  53

               The shattered concrete has been pulled away to fully reveal
               the creature's horrendous head.  Start CLOSE on it: oozing
               blood, slavering mouth plates hanging open, hook-tentacles
               lolling out.  WIDEN to see Earl and Rhonda, sweating, dusty
               and tired, staring in awe and cringing at the stench.

                                          EARL
                            Jesus Christ...think it smells like
                            that 'cause it's dead?

                                          RHONDA
                            I don't see any eyes...must be
                            totally subterranean...and those
                            tentacles...

                                          EARL
                            I think they shoot right outta its
                            mouth, hook you, and pull you right
                            in.  Good thing we stopped it
                            before it killed anybody else.

                                          RHONDA
                                   (shudders)
                            Yeah, I'm lucky it didn't find me.
                                   (overwhelmed)
                            This is important, you know.  This
                            is like, well, let's say it, it's
                            probably the biggest zoological
                            discovery of the century.  The
                            century?  Forget it.  History.

               We can hear a shovel digging up above, and now Val shouts:

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            I got it!  Here's the other end!
                            Just look at what we caught here!

               Earl and Rhonda climb up.  CRANE UP with them to REVEAL the
               whole animal!  Val, digging excitedly with Rhonda's shovel,
               is just scraping away the last loose dirt from the creature's
               tail.  The whole length of the immense thirty foot beast is
               partially uncovered, in king-sized bas-relief.

                                          EARL
                                   (hushed)
                            This is one big mother!

                                          VAL
                            So this is the guy that had your
                            seismos working overtime?

               She nods, stepping down to study the creature.  The body is
               stream-lined, cigar-shaped, maybe eight feet in diameter at
               its thickest.  It's covered with hundreds of short, rear-
               pointing, retractable spikes.  Rhonda gingerly jiggles one.
               It can be pushed in and out of its socket like a plunger.

                                          RHONDA (cont'd)
                            It must push itself along with
                            these.  Hundreds of them pushing at
                            once.  That's how it can move so
                            fast.  I mean this thing was
                            tripping sensors all over the
                            valley.  No wonder I couldn't...

               A chilling thought stops her in mid-sentence.  She springs
               down into the drainage ditch to get her backpack, pulling out
               her seismograph printouts.  She studies them frantically
               during:

                                          EARL
                            Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of
                            anything like this before?

                                          VAL
                                   (elbows Earl)
                            Sure, Earl, everybody knows about
                            them.  We just didn't tell you.
                            Come on, nobody's ever seen one of
                            these!  We're really in on
                            something here!

               The guys looks at each other.  One thought immediately springs
               to their minds.

                                          EARL
                            Pham Van don't get his mitts on
                            this for no measly fifteen bucks!

                                          VAL
                            You got that right!

               While they bask in their fame-to-be, Rhonda continues to
               study the print-outs, coming to a terrifying conclusion.

                                          EARL
                            Here's the plan: we'll get a...a
                            flatbed, I guess, with a big winch,
                            figure a five ton anyway.

                                          VAL
                            Naw, don't want to winch it.  That'd
                            tear it all up.  Want to lift it.
                            Some kind of crane with lifting
                            straps.

               But Rhonda interrupts -- now really scared.

                                          RHONDA
                            Hey, hey, shut up!  The way I
                            figure it.  There are five more of
                            these things!

               Val and Earl shut right up.  Earl edges up a fencepost.  Val
               sidles up onto a rock during:

                                          EARL
                            Five more?

               Rhonda paws through her unwieldy printouts, pointing out
               jagged ink lines on the graphs, comparing different ones.

                                          RHONDA
                            Yeah, darn it, look.  I've got
                            seismographs all over the valley.
                            If you compare the different
                            readings, there have to be five.
                            Here's one at two o'clock
                            yesterday, but here's another one
                            three miles away at the same time.
                            So that's two.  Now, here...

               The men leap from their perches and hustle her in the
               direction she came from.

                                          VAL
                            We'll take your word for it.

                                          EARL
                            Yeah.  Where's your truck?

                                          RHONDA
                            The other side of that dome.

               She indicates what to most of us would be a hill, dotted with
               huge boulders thrusting out of the sandy desert soil like big
               mushrooms.  The trio jogs toward the hill.


         54    EXT.  DESERT - SEISMOGRAPH - DAY                             54

               En route to the truck, they pass near one of Rhonda's
               seismographs.  Suddenly Earl stumbles as one leg drops knee-
               deep into the ground!  He screams.  Val wheels and bodily
               yanks him up.  They back away from the small hole in the
               ground, calming a little as they realize:

                                          EARL
                            Prairie dog burrow...

                                          VAL
                            Little sons of bitches.

               Rhonda tenses as she hears a sound she knows well -- the soft
               scratching of the seismograph needle across its paper
               cylinder.  She whacks Val on the shoulder and points
               speechlessly at it.


         55    INSERT - SEISMOGRAPH                                         55

               The needle is going wild!!


         56    BACK TO SCENE                                                56

               She doesn't have to explain.  All three of them dash dash for:


         57    EXT.  BOULDER FIELD - DAY                                    57

               The remains of an old rail fence lay beside one of the
               boulders.  Val, Earl, and Rhonda scramble over the wood, up
               onto the rock and stand there tensely.

               In a moment, the creature gently rustles the earth at the
               base of the rock.  The monster's slimy hook-tentacles slither
               out, searching the rock base.  Shuddering, the humans move as
               high as they can, well out of reach.  The tentacles slip back
               beneath the earth.  Everyone breathes a sigh of relief.

                                          EARL
                            Well, at least the bastard can't
                            climb.  Pardon my French.

                                          RHONDA
                            Probably couldn't move too easily
                            on the surface.

                                          VAL
                            God, the live ones smell worse tan
                            the dead ones.

                                          EARL
                            Okay, now, how far's your truck?

               Rhonda points.  They can see the roof of her truck, maybe a
               hundred yards away through the boulders.  Val and Earl think
               about it.

                                          VAL
                            I don't know.  If this one's any
                            faster than that other one...

                                          EARL
                                   (nods)
                            I think we wait right here.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:


         58    EXT.  BOULDER FIELD - SUNSET                                 58

               It's hours later.  Stiff and uncomfortable, they have nothing
               to do but theorize.

                                          RHONDA
                            There's nothing like them in the
                            fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so
                            they predate the fossil record...
                                   (not buying it herself)
                            That'd make them a couple of
                            billion years old...and we've just
                            never seen one till now.  Right.

                                          EARL
                            I'd vote for outer space.  No way
                            those are local boys.

                                          VAL
                                   (joking)
                            Atomic testing.  Or, no, bio-
                            engineering!  The government built
                            them, a big surprise in the next
                            war.

               There's a long pause.  Earl stares at the dirt around the rock.

                                          EARL
                            Well...haven't seen a sign for
                            hours.  Maybe it's long gone.

                                          VAL
                            Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a
                            little stroll and see?

                                          EARL
                            Fuck you, too.  Pardon my French.

                                          RHONDA
                            Well, we've got to do something.

               Val gets an idea.  He grabs a post from the dilapidated fence
               and cautiously slips down near the boulder's edge.

                                          EARL
                            Watch yourself!  It's got a good
                            six foot reach.

               Val nods.  Dead silence as he reaches way out with the post
               and scrapes it on the ground.  Almost instantly the creature
               roars up, grabbing the post in a flurry of flying dirt and
               lashing tentacles, nearly hooking Val's hand.  Val
               practically falls over himself scrambling back to safety.

                                          VAL
                            Son of a bitch!

                                          EARL
                            Son of a goddamned bitch!  Been
                            waiting there all this time.  How
                            the hell's it even know we're still
                            here?

                                          VAL
                            It's been listening to us.  It's
                            got no eyes.  It sure as hell can't
                            smell anything underground, so I
                            figure...

               Rhonda stares at Val, impressed.

                                          RHONDA
                            Of course!  It can sense the
                            slightest seismic vibration...hear
                            every move we make.  Especially on
                            this rock.  It's a perfect
                            conductor.

               They all settle back, having no idea what to do next.  Rhonda
               gazes out at the desert that surrounds them like an ocean.

                                          RHONDA (cont'd)
                            I always wanted to be stuck on a
                            desert island.  But somehow I
                            always imagined, you know, water.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

         58A   EXT.  BOULDER FIELD - NIGHT                                 58A

               Our heroes are silhouetted against a huge, spectacular,
               desert night sky.  After a very long pause:

                                          EARL
                            You know, I hate to be crude, but
                            I'm gonna have to take care of some
                            business here.

                                          VAL
                                   (emphatic)
                            Me, too.

                                          RHONDA
                                   (just as emphatic)
                            Same here.

               The silhouettes shift, Val and Earl moving down one side of
               the rock, and Rhonda down the other.  We can no longer see
               them.  We just head zippers zipping down -- then soft sighs
               of relief from Val and Earl.  Then:

                                          RHONDA (V.O.)
                                   (softly)
                            Darn it!

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            You okay?

                                          RHONDA (V.O.)
                            Yeah.  But I'll tell you, if you
                            ever wanted proof God is a man,
                            this is it.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:


         59    EXT.  BOULDER FIELD - DAWN                                   59

               Rich orange sunlight creeps silently across the deathly still
               desert.  Earl is already awake.  Val is curled up without his
               jacket, shivering.  He wakes with a start.  Where the hell's
               his jacket?

               Rhonda wakes slowly.  She's surprised to find herself wrapped
               in Val's jacket.  Touched by his chivalry, she embarrassedly
               hands it to baffled Val.

                                          RHONDA
                            Thanks.

               Val glances at Earl, who looks away.  Who, me?

                                          VAL
                                   (to Rhonda)
                            No problem.  Anytime.

               Earl gropes through his pockets, coming up with only
               cigarettes.  Val fishes in his own pockets, finding only
               their lighter.  They exchange items and light up during:

                                          EARL
                            Well, folks, what's the plan?

                                          VAL
                            First let's see if Stumpy's still
                            out there.

               This time he tosses a piece of wood out onto the sand.  With
               soft rustling, a bulge forms in the earth, moves over to the
               wood, then subsides.  Rhonda starts looking around during:

                                          EARL
                            Don't he have a home to go to?

                                          VAL
                                   (grim)
                            Well, that's why Edgar never got
                            down off that tower.

                                          RHONDA
                            I might have an idea...

                                          EARL
                                   (ignoring her)
                            We're gonna have to come up with
                            some kind of plan or it's just
                            gonna wait us to death.

                                          RHONDA
                            Well, I was wondering if we
                            could...

                                          VAL
                            Well, let's just run for it.  We
                            outran that one yesterday, at least
                            on a sprint.

               Rhonda gives up on them.  She goes over and pulls a long
               cross rail from the fence during:

                                          EARL
                            Run for it?  Running's not a plan.
                            Running is what you do when the
                            plan fails.  You're not even trying
                            to come up with a plan!

                                          VAL
                            Well, it's not like we've got a
                            hell of a lot of options...

                                          RHONDA
                                   (interrupting)
                            You guys know how to pole vault?

               They watch in surprise as she hefts her pole, checks the
               balance, eyeballs the distance to the nearest boulder.  Then
               she charges between them, plants her pole and vaults smoothly
               over to the next boulder, maybe fifteen feet away.  The
               creature surfaces where her pole touched down, but too late
               -- a hook tentacle vainly sweeps the area, the disappears
               into the ground.  Val and Earl glance at each other,
               impressed.

                                          RHONDA (cont'd)
                            We just stay where it can't get
                            us...on these residual boulders.
                            My truck's parked right next to
                            one.

               Earl rushes to grab a couple more fence rails.

                                          EARL
                            Stay on those residual boulders!

               Val just stands staring across at Rhonda -- his horizons are
               broadening.  Earl stuffs a fence rail into his hands.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                                   (pointedly)
                            Tammy Lynn Baxter, she do a lot of
                            pole-vaulting?

               Earl takes a deep breath and goes for it, vaulting across to
               Rhonda.  Val follows.


         60    EXT.  BOULDER FIELD - WIDE SHOT - DAY                        60

               Through the shimmering heat in the distance we see the
               strange sight of the three figures vaulting from boulder to
               boulder.


         61    EXT.  BOULDER FIELD - RHONDA'S TRUCK - DAY                   61

               Val, Earl and Rhonda pole-vault their way toward the truck.
               Finally they're at the nearest boulder, but the truck is
               still ten feet away.

                                          VAL
                            Think it's still following us?

                                          RHONDA
                            Let's assume that it is.

                                          EARL
                            And once we hit that truck we gotta
                            go fast.  I say we all jump together.

               Rhonda and Val nod.  Rhonda grips her car keys in her teeth.

                                          RHONDA
                                   (through clenched teeth)
                            Ready?

                                          VAL
                            Yeah.  One, two, three...

               They all vault in unison, landing in the truck bed.  Rhonda
               scrambles up, slides open the cab's rear window, and begins
               wriggling through headfirst.

                                          EARL
                                   (whispers)
                            Come on, girl, it ain't gonna give
                            us much time...

               Dust explodes around the rear of the truck!  Hook-tentacles
               snake up on all sides, narrowly missing Val.  He and Earl
               grab whatever's handy, pounding at the tentacles with
               expensive instruments.

                                          VAL
                            GO!  GO!  GO!

               Rhonda's only half way through the cab window, still hanging
               headfirst into the cab.  She frantically starts the truck,
               dives down and punches the accelerator with her fist.

               As the truck roars away, one tentacles manages to tear off the
               the muffler.  The engine thunders like a tank.  Val and Earl
               sit back, sighing in relief, then react when they see
               Rhonda is driving upside down and blind.


         62    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 62

               Rhonda skids her noisy truck to a halt in front of Pham Van's.

                                          VAL
                            We better get everybody together.

               Val leaps out and jumps into his pick-up truck.  He searches
               for the key.

                                          EARL
                            You go north, I'll go south.

                                          VAL
                            Right.

               Val holds out his hand for the key.  Earl tosses it to him.
               Val drives off.  We FOLLOW Rhonda and Earl as they drive the
               other way, toward Viola's.

                                          EARL
                            I'll bet you're sorry the college
                            ever sent you up here.

                                          RHONDA
                            Well, I'm scared, but I'm not
                            sorry.

                                          EARL
                            You know, Val went to that college,
                            too.  For a whole year.  Couldn't
                            quite sit still for it, though.
                            Had too much vinegar in his system.
                            But once he settles down, forgets
                            this cowboy stuff, he'll be one in
                            a million.

               Rhonda sees straight through Earl's clumsy attempt at match-
               making.  She can't help but smile.  Earl grins sheepishly.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            All right, I'm about as subtle as
                            a donkey's ass.  Pardon my French.
                            I'm just saying the boy's got
                            potential, that's all.

               MOVE IN on Rhonda -- her and Val?


         63    INT. PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                  63

               Nestor, Viola, Nancy, and Miguel nervously crowd around Val,
               Earl, and Rhonda.  Viola holds her yappy dog which perio-
               dically snarls and snaps at people.  Pham Van is on his CB
               radio trying to contact Burt and Heather.

                                          MIGUEL
                            You serious, Val?  You think we're
                            not even safe here in town?

                                          VAL
                            Ask me that after you meet one.  I
                            think we should all get the hell
                            out while the getting's good.

                                          NESTOR
                            Why not just take a Number Ten pick
                            axe and give it one good whack...?

                                          VAL
                            Nestor, damn it, these things are
                            bigger than an Airstream trailer!

                                          NANCY
                            God, I've got to find Mindy.

               Nancy rushes out.

                                          EARL
                            Hey, Pham, where's Burt and Heather?

                                          PHAM VAN
                                   (hangs up CB)
                            Can't raise them.  I guess they're
                            still out there somewhere.

                                          RHONDA
                            If you've got a radio, why aren't
                            you calling somebody in Bixby?  The
                            police or...

                                          PHAM VAN
                            Can't reach outside the valley.
                            You know, because of the mountains.

                                          MIGUEL
                            Hey, Rhonda, what's the name you
                            call those things, huh?

                                          PHAM VAN
                            Where'd they come from?

                                          RHONDA
                            Huh?  I don't know.

                                          PHAM VAN
                            You're a scientist, right?

                                          VIOLA
                            You should have a theory at least.

                                          RHONDA
                            Look, these things are absolutely
                            unprecedented!

                                          NESTOR
                            Yeah, but where'd they come from?

                                          RHONDA
                                   (exasperated)
                            Where'd they come from?  Okay,
                            worms, probably in the Jurassic
                            period.  Cosmic radiation was much
                            higher then...so they mutated...and
                            they got so big they just sank
                            right into the ground and fell
                            asleep... But now continental drift
                            has brought them to the surface,
                            ready to be harvested by the
                            ancient alien meat growers who
                            planted them here.

               Everybody stares at her, then they smile, realizing she's
               pulling their legs.

                                          EARL
                            You're right, don't matter where
                            they come from.

                                          VAL
                            Right.  We need to be talking about
                            what we're gonna do.

                                          VIOLA
                            My goodness, Valentine, once they
                            see the road is out and the phone
                            lines are down, someone will be
                            along to look in on us.  Don't you
                            think?


         64    EXT.  CANYON ROAD - DAY                                      64

               We see the utility truck still parked near the landslide
               blocking the road.  REVEAL, on the far side, a telephone
               maintenance truck is now parked, emergency lights flashing --
               and nearby, amid phoneworkers' climbing and repair gear, two
               more hard hats lying on blood-soaked ground.


         65    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 65

               The crowd is still jabbering away.  Rhonda speak over them:

                                          RHONDA
                            No no no, they listen!  They can
                            sense the slightest vibration
                            through the ground.  That's how
                            they see!  That's how they hunt!

                                          MIGUEL
                            So, like we don't vibrate, right?
                            Maybe they won't even come to here,
                            huh?  Maybe they leave us alone.

               Val shakes his head, and marches over to the topographic map
               on the wall.

                                          VAL
                            They caught up with Edgar here.
                            They grabbed Old Fred here.  They
                            nailed the asshole dog here.  And the
                            doctor's place is here...

               The spots he indicates describe a line leading along the
               valley straight toward town.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            This valley's just one long
                            smorgasbord and if we don't haul
                            ass outta here we're the next
                            course.

               We hear an a eerie SHRIEK from outside.  Something shoots in
               through the window, striking Earl in the chest!!  Earl flails
               frantically at it -- but it's only Melvin's basketball.  We
               glimpse Melvin outside, doubled over with laughter.  Earl
               grabs the ball and hurls it viciously back, but Melvin easily
               dodges it.

                                          EARL
                            You little ass wipe!  You knock
                            that off or you're gonna be
                            shitting that basketball!  Pardon
                            my French.

                                          NESTOR
                                   (to Val)
                            Now, Val, let's assume they're as
                            dangerous as you say.  Where are we
                            going to go that's safer than right
                            here?

                                          VAL
                            Rhonda's got an idea about that.

                                          RHONDA
                            Yes, see, they move very easily
                            through the Pleistocene Alluvials...
                                   (off their blank looks)
                            ...the dirt...the loose soil that
                            makes up the valley floor.  But
                            they can't move through solid rock.
                            I think we should travel west to
                            the mountains.

                                          EARL
                            You know, up the jeep trail.

                                          RHONDA
                            The mountains are solid granite.
                            We'd be safe there, and we could
                            hike along them...all the way to
                            Bixby if we have to.


         66    EXT.  EDGE OF TOWN - DAY                                     66

               Nancy rushes back toward Pham Van's, still looking.

                                          NANCY
                            Mindy!  Mindy!


         67    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 67

               We're CLOSE on Melvin as he circles around the back of Pham
               Van's, bouncing his basketball, mischief in his eyes.  We can
               hear the townsfolk inside.

                                          VIOLA (V.O.)
                            No, Valentine, I'm not leaving my
                            place.

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            Well, it's gonna take us days to
                            get back with help.

                                          EARL (V.O.)
                            Doggone it, Viola, it's just plain
                            crazy to stay.

               Then, to Melvin's astonishment, the steady rhythm of his
               bouncing basketball suddenly stops.  The ball just goes flup
               and doesn't bounce back up to him.  He looks down.  No ball!
               Just swirling dust at his feet.


         68    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 68

               Everyone jumps as we once more hear an ear-shattering SHRIEK
               from Melvin.  Earl snarls and heads for the door, Val right
               behind them.

                                          EARL
                            I'm gonna kick his ass!

                                          VAL
                            I'm gonna help you.


         69    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 69

               Val and Earl are well ahead of the other townsfolk as they
               march around to the side of Pham Van's.  But where's Melvin?
               Nothing out here but the oppressive, hot desert silence.
               Then they hear a soft shuddering whimper -- from above.
               There's terrified Melvin, halfway up a telephone pole,
               clinging to it desperately.

               Val and Earl freeze in their tracks and glance at each
               other, realizing instantly what's up.  Without a word they
               leap desperately in opposite directions.  Like a breaching
               whale, a creature roars up through the earth right where they
               were standing, great mouth gaping open, slimy tentacles
               lashing in all directions.

               The townsfolk scatter, some heading for their homes,
               including Viola and Nestor.  Others scramble over each other
               as they pile back into Pham Van's.  The telephone pole
               shudders.  Melvin falls and scampers for the nearest hiding
               place, a corrugated tin storage shed near Pham Van's.


         70    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 70

               Val, Earl, Rhonda, Miguel, and Pham Van rush in.

                                          MIGUEL
                            Jesus Christ!  Man, you gut a gun?!

                                          PHAM VAN
                            Big as a house!  What are we gonna
                            do...?!

                                          RHONDA
                            Quiet!  QUIET!!

               Miguel and Pham shut up.  Then we hear something new -- the
               building itself creaking and groaning like a ship.  The
               liquor bottles behind Pham Van's bar vibrate and clink.  The
               creature is moving beneath the building.  The people freeze
               like mannequins.  Now we can hear its pig-like snorting.
               Pham Van and Miguel react as the awful smell percolates up
               through the floorboards.  Val signals them to keep quiet.
               Finally, the creaking stops.

               Rhonda addresses the group in an intense whisper:

                                          RHONDA
                            Remember...no noise.  No vibration.

               Everyone stands stock still -- and sweats.  But, then, slowly
               we become aware of a faint, yet oddly familiar sound.
               Squeak, squeak, squeak -- Mindy on her pogo stick!  They all
               scramble to the windows.


         71    EXT.  MAIN STREET - DAY                                      71

               There she is, alone in the vacant street, Walkman blaring in
               her ears, merrily bouncing along to a rock 'n' roll beat.


         72    ANGLE - PHAM VAN'S STORE                                     72

               Thoughts of personal safety vanish as the horrified people
               lean way out the doors and windows and shout with one voice:

                                          CROWD
                                   (ad lib)
                            MINDY!
                            Get off your pogo stick!
                            Get in here, girl!
                            Run, Mindy!


         73    ANGLE - MINDY                                                73

               She can't hear them over her Walkman.  A tell-tale puff of
               dust spurts up not fifty feet from her!


         74    ANGLE - PHAM VAN'S STORE                                     74

               Val sees Mindy has only seconds left!  He vaults straight out
               the window and charges toward her!  Right behind him comes
               Earl and Rhonda.


         75    ANGLE - NANCY                                                75

               As she rounds a corner at the opposite end of town.  She
               spots Mindy, then sees Val running.  She starts running.

                                          NANCY
                            Mindy!  Mindy!


         76    ANGLE - MINDY                                                76

               She's lazily bouncing in circles -- squeak, squeak, squeak.
               She goes wide-eyed as she rotates to see Val coming at her
               like a mad bull, arms outstretched.  The asphalt under her
               pogo stick cracks and --

               Val tackles her, both of them tumbling head over heels.  She
               scrambles up, rubbing her skinned elbow and yelling:

                                          MINDY
                            Oww!  Val, you hurt me...!

               Val claps his hand over her mouth.  She goes wide eyed as she
               sees: her pogo stick standing straight up in the cracked
               asphalt!  Then it is sucked down like so much spaghetti!

               Nancy rushes into frame, hugging Mindy.  Val signals her to
               be quiet.  They sit uneasily.  Where's the creature?
               Suddenly the pogo stick erupts out of the earth right in
               their midst!

               Val runs one way, Nancy and Mindy the other, heading up the
               street toward their house.  Val scrambles up onto his pick-up
               truck!  The creature rams the truck, rupturing a tire.  As it
               shakes the truck violently, Val spots Rhonda and Earl, now
               standing uncertainly halfway between him and Pham Van's.

                                          VAL
                            Go back, for chrissake!

               Rhonda and Earl hesitate.

                                          EARL
                            We gotta get him off there.  It'll
                            suck that truck down!

               But Earl now hears something behind them!  Down the street,
               a little wall of cinder blocks framing Viola's driveway
               suddenly topples over.

                                          EARL
                            Oh, Jesus.  Rhonda, another one!


         77    ANGLE - LOW CAMERA - RHONDA AND EARL                         77

               CAMERA charges toward them.  Earl swerves toward Pham Van's,
               but Rhonda is cut off!  She heads toward the next nearest
               haven:


         78    EXT.  STORAGE SHED - DAY                                     78

               The storage shed where Melvin is hiding.  It sits in a
               vacant, weed-choked lot.  Crashing through the weeds, Rhonda
               has almost reached the shed when she is suddenly brought up
               short and slams face down in a cloud of dust!

               She can't get up!!  Something's got her!  She's caught in an
               old rusted barbed wire fence, lying almost flat, hidden in
               the weeds.  Some strands have come loose and are curled up
               like vicious concertina wire.

               Barely has she taken this in when -- the ground caves in
               under her!  She rolls wildly to one side as hook-tentacles
               snake up, missing her by inches!  She keeps rolling-crawling-
               scrambling -- anything to get away from the awful maw -- but
               gets her legs hopelessly tangled in the barbed wire.  She
               freezes.  The creature feels around where she was.

               She calms herself, pulling gingerly at the wire, working
               tensely to free herself but --

               The creature's mouth slams shut on the fence.  Like a spider
               sensing something caught in its web, the monster knows it's
               on to something.  Its hook-tentacles shoot forward to snare
               three feet of fence, then the creature lunges up and out,
               swallowing that three feet in a big "gulp" and yanking Rhonda
               violently toward it!  She screams, pants ripped, legs slashed
               and bleeding!  GULP!  She's dragged even closer.


         79    EXT.  MAIN STREET - THE PICK-UP - DAY                        79

               The truck shakes and shimmies as Val's creature tries to pull
               it down.  Val sees that Rhonda's in trouble.  He searches
               frantically for a weapon -- and finds one -- a CHAIN SAW!  He
               leaps as far from the truck as he can and hits the ground
               running, yanking furiously on the saw's starter cord.


         80    EXT.  STORAGE SHED - DAY                                     80

               Rhonda is in a dead panic, thrashing helplessly in the barbed
               wire.  The beast takes another gulp of fence, wrenching her
               within inches of a probing hook-tentacle!  Suddenly we hear a
               nasty ROAR as Val's chain saw swings in, slicing the squirm-
               ing tentacle in half, spraying gore everywhere!  The creature
               unleashes an unearthly shriek, and the other tentacles
               recoil.  The severed one writhes like a beheaded snake.

               Val yanks off Rhonda's boots.

                                          VAL
                            Come on!  Outta your pants!

               She frantically claws at her belt.  But in mere seconds:

                                          RHONDA
                                   (pointing)
                            LOOK OUT!

               Tentacles snake out to regain their grip on the fence.  Val
               grabs the saw and starts slashing wildly, but this time the
               hook-tentacles snag it and wrench it from his grasp.  It
               slams to the ground, motor dying.  The monster readies itself
               for the lunge that will suck Rhonda in.  Val grabs her under
               the arms and pulls.  Rhonda wriggles wildly to get out of her
               wire enmeshed pants.

               The creature lunges!  Rhonda pulls free!  She and Val tumble
               backward.  The creature gets only a mouthful of Rhonda's jeans.

               The next instant the second creature explodes up through the
               ground right next to fallen Val and Rhonda!  They roll
               sideways, come up running, and sprint for Pham Van's along an
               old wooden sidewalk.


         81    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 81

               Earl flings open the front door.  Val and Rhonda race toward
               the porch.  Right on their heels the creature ripples the
               boards like an ocean wave!

                                          EARL
                            Come on!  Come on!  Don't look back!
                            Just run!  Run like screaming fuck!

               They dive through the open door of Pham Van's.  The rippling
               boards zoom on past it.  Earl quickly eases the door shut.


         82    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 82

               Earl turns to breathless Rhonda.

                                          EARL
                                   (whispers)
                            Pardon my French.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:


         83    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - LATER                               83

               It's a tense, edgy group.  Every movement made is in slow
               motion, every word is a whisper.   They gaze grimly out the
               windows at the silent, deserted, heat-shimmering main street.

               Val gingerly dabs iodine onto the cuts on Rhonda's legs.
               She doesn't even wince.

                                          VAL
                            You paying attention?  This oughta
                            hurt like hell.

                                          RHONDA
                            It does.

               She smiles at him.

                                          RHONDA (cont'd)
                            So, is that one of your usual jobs,
                            saving peoples' lives?

                                          VAL
                                   (embarrassed)
                            First time for me.

               She gazes at him.  He looks away.  Over at the bar, Pham
               holds up a new pair of pants for Rhonda.

                                          RHONDA
                            Oh, thank you.

               Grateful for something to do, Val eases over to get the
               pants.  Rhonda looks after him.  Then she becomes aware of
               someone staring at her.  It's Earl, giving her a big Cheshire
               cat grin that says "What did I tell you?"

               Pham hands the pants to Val.  Then Pham and Miguel reach
               simultaneously for a sods bottle and -- knock it over!  It
               rolls all the way down the bar as a flurry of desperate hands
               try to stop it.  No good.  It rolls off the end and -- CRASH!

               Everyone freezes.  Sure enough the building shudders.  Floor
               boards creak and bend as searching tentacles thump and scrape
               along under the floor.  People close their eyes, not even
               breathing.  Finally the noise subsides.  Everyone relaxes --
               a little.

                                          MIGUEL
                            So what are we gonna do, you know?
                            How long till they go away?

                                          EARL
                                   (shakes his head)
                            They got the patience of Job.  They
                            just sit and goddamn wait til they
                            hear something that sounds like
                            lunch.  We need a plan.

                                          PHAM VAN
                            I've got a plan.  You and Val take
                            your truck, get to the mountains.
                            Hike to Bixby.  Get us some help.

                                          VAL
                            Those scumsuckers are my radials,
                            Pham!

                                          RHONDA
                            Well, we can take my truck then.

                                          EARL
                            No good.  You need major four-
                            wheel-drive just to get up that
                            jeep trail.

               They all shut up when they hear Viola's dog yapping in the
               distance.


         84    EXT.  VIOLA'S TRAILER - DAY                                  84

               Up the hill across from Pham Van's, the old trailer looks
               perfectly peaceful.  Except Viola's dog keeps yapping.  Then
               we hear panicked Viola.

                                          VIOLA (V.O.)
                            Quiet!  Quiet you hateful thing...!


         85    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 85

                                          EARL
                            Shut it up!  Shut the little
                            bastard up!

                                          VAL
                            Chuck him out the door!  Like a
                            little hors d'oeuvre.



               INT.  VIOLA'S TRAILER - DAY

               We hear a loud whap!  The dog's bark simply changes to
               piercing yelps.  It would be funny except --

               The trailer suddenly bucks upward, hit from below as though
               by a pile driver!  Again and again the unseen creatures slam
               into the frail structure.

                                          VIOLA (V.O.)
                            Get away!  Get away!  Oh God in
                            heaven, help me!

               The trailer is finally knocked right off its foundation!  It
               tips over and tumbles all the way down the hill!  As the dust
               clears, all is silent.  A huge hole is torn in the trailer's
               floor.  Viola's possessions are scattered everywhere.


         86    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 86

               Everyone stares in shock.

                                          RHONDA
                            Oh my God.

                                          EARL
                            Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid,
                            scum...

                                          VAL
                            Gotta do something.  Gotta get the
                            bastards!

                                          MIGUEL
                                   (hopeless)
                            Man, what the hell can we do to
                            those things?

                                          EARL
                            Well, we're sure as hell not going
                            to sit here being quiet for God
                            knows how long.  Are we?

                                          PHAM VAN
                            Now wait a minute, Earl.  I got
                            enough food here to last us for
                            weeks.  Those damn things can't
                            wait around forever.
                                   (pause)
                            We can do it.  I mean, if we have
                            to, right?

               Everyone turns away from the windows, gingerly sitting down,
               glumly pondering this possibility.  There is a long silence.

               Then suddenly -- ROAR!  The silence is shattered as Pham
               Van's big freezer compressor suddenly comes on.

                                          EARL
                            Jesus!  Shut it off!

               Pham runs to the freezer.  Its on/off switch is buried behind
               stacks of soft-drink cases.  He tears at them like a madman,
               toppling them this way and that.  Earl and Val join him.

               But right behind Pham, the floor BUCKLES UP, a monster's
               snout BURSTING THROUGH and engulfing one of his legs!  The
               creature starts to back down into the jagged hole, dragging
               screaming Pham with it.  Val, Earl, Rhonda, and Miguel grab
               Pham's arms but are no match for the monster.  It shakes and
               spins him like some gigantic dog, effortlessly throwing them
               off, relentlessly pulling Pham down.

               The hole in the floor is too small for Pham to fit through!
               As one leg goes down, the other is bent hideously backward.
               Pham screams and screams as jagged wood tears into him, bones
               snap, ribs crack.  The others grab him again but are utterly
               helpless.  With vicious, powerful jerks the creature yanks
               his man mangled body down.  The last thing we see is his foot,
               now folded back past his head, and he's gone.

               Val is wild with helpless anger.

                                          VAL
                            Son of a bitch!  Son of a bitch!

               The floor bulges up in another place!  A second creature!
               Then a third, coming RIGHT UP UNDER THEM!  Earl sprawls onto
               the bar.  Rhonda springs onto the shelves in the middle of the
               store, knocking groceries everywhere.  Val and Miguel climb up
               shelves which cover the rear wall of the store.

               The whole building shakes and shudders, dust powdering down
               from the ceiling.  Flailing tentacles are everywhere,
               slashing open food packages; clouds of flour fill the air!

               Val spots a hatch in the ceiling.

                                          VAL
                            Everybody!  This way!  The roof!

               Earl leaps from the bar to the rear shelves.  Val and Miguel
               slide sideways till they're beneath the hatch, then use the
               shelves as a ladder, climbing up to the hatch.  Val pounds on
               it frantically.

               In the middle of the store, Rhonda leaps from shelf to shelf,
               trying to get closer to where Val is.  Soon she reaches the
               last one, balancing precariously.  But a creature tips over
               the first one!  The shelves topple like dominoes, crashing
               toward Rhonda.  She is half catapulted, half jumps right
               through an open window, ripping through the screen.

               Val sees what's happened.  With maniacal strength he smashes
               open the hatch and climbs out onto --


         87    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          87

               Val rushes to the edge of the roof shouting:

                                          VAL
                            Rhonda!  Keep moving.  Don't stop!

               He looks down where Rhonda fell.  She's not there.  He hears
               a whistle and is relieved to see:


         88    EXT.  WATER TOWER - DAY                                      88

               Rhonda is perched as high as she can get on the water tower
               near Pham Van's.  It's maybe twenty-five feet tall, a simple
               wood frame holding a big galvanized tank.  The wooden legs
               stand on big concrete anchors buried in the ground.


         89    EXT.  STORAGE SHED - DAY                                     89

               Melvin peers terrified out the shed door, up at the guys on
               Pham Van's roof.

                                          MELVIN
                            Hey!  What's going on, man?!  What
                            the hell you doing up there...?!

                                          MIGUEL
                            Melvin, shut the hell up!

               It's too late.  Wham!  A creature strikes.  The little shed
               shudders, dust puffing from every old seam.  In a split
               second Melvin has climbed to the shed roof.


         90    EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    90

               Nancy and Mindy peer to the window, surprised to see the men
               on Pham Van's roof.


         91    EXT.  PERFECTION - WIDE - DAY                                91

               We hear Val's shouting to the remaining townsfolk.

                                          VAL
                            Nancy!  Nestor!


         92    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          92

                                          VAL
                            Get up on your roof!  On your roof!
                            They can come through the floor!

               The store shakes and shimmies.  We hear the monster's
               thunderous crashing from below.

                                          EARL
                            Can't you shout a little quieter?


         93    EXT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - DAY                           93

               Burt and Heather's place, about a mile from town, is no-
               nonsense, functional, ugly -- unpainted concrete walls, no
               yard, chain-link fence.  Burt and Heather drive up in their
               big Blazer and park right beside the house.  Hot and tired,
               they climb out, each carrying a heavy, scoped hunting rifle.
               Burt peers toward Perfection through binoculars during:

                                          HEATHER
                            I can't believe it.  No tracks, no
                            sign, no spoor.

                                          BURT
                            Yeah, whatever they are, you'd
                            think after they ate all those
                            sheep they'd have to take a dump
                            someplace...
                                   (reacts to what he sees)
                            What the hell's going on in town?


         94    EXT.  PERFECTION - TELEPHOTO - BURT'S P.O.V. - DAY           94

               The town is a very strange sight.  It's as though an
               invisible flood were in progress, driving people to high
               ground.  We see: Rhonda perched on the water tower; Val, Earl
               and Miguel on the store roof; Nancy and Mindy on their roof;
               Melvin on the storage shed; Nestor on his roof.


         95    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          95

               Val, Earl and Miguel gaze out at the town, trying to concoct
               a plan.   Suddenly Earl perks up.  The men speak softly.

                                          EARL
                            Hey, here's the plan: Nestor's
                            Cadillac.  His tires are nine
                            hundred sixteens.  We sprint for
                            it, grab the spare, put it on our
                            truck with our spare.

               Val stares at him, incredulous.

                                          VAL
                            How the hell long it take you to
                            change a tire?

                                          EARL
                                   (sighs)
                            Just about too damn long.  Bolt
                            pattern's probably wrong anyway.

                                          VAL
                            We need another plan.

               Suddenly, down in the store, Pham Van's CB radio squawks
               loudly.

                                          BURT (V.O.)
                            Yo, P.V., Burt here.  Come back.

               The building shudders as the creatures again smash through
               the floor inside, looking for the source of the noise.  Val,
               Earl and Miguel scramble to the edge of the roof.


         96    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 96

               The CB radio sits on a shelf near an open window.  Tentacles
               are feeling along the wall just below it.  Val appears out-
               side the window -- upside-down.  He snatches the radio and is
               hauled straight up out of frame.

                                          BURT (V.O.)
                            Pham?  Anybody copy?


         97    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          97

               Miguel and Earl haul Val by the feet back up onto the roof.
               Val quickly turns down the CB volume.

                                          VAL
                                   (whispers into mic)
                            Burt, now listen.  We found out
                            what's been killing people.  Over?


         98    INT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY                98

               A peculiar cross between bomb shelter and blue-collar den,
               Burt's wood-paneled basement has all the comforts for post-
               Apocalypse living.  Burt talks on his CB.

                                          BURT
                            Negative copy on that, Pham, check
                            your frequency.  I'm on forty-nine.

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                                   (a little louder)
                            Burt, can you hear me now?

                                          BURT
                            Just barely, Pham.  What are you
                            all doing up on your roofs. What
                            the hell's going on?  Come back.

               A few feet away Heather works at their ammunition reloading
               bench.  She dumps a few hundred empty cartridge cases into a
               case cleaner and switches it on.  It HUMS loudly as it
               vibrates.


         99    INT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAY                                 99

               The groping tentacles swiftly suck back below the floor.
               TILT UP to see out the window some distance away, a couple of
               old trash cans topple over as the creature streaks past
               beneath them, making a bee-line for Burt's.


         100   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          100

               Miguel points frantically at the trash cans.

                                          MIGUEL
                            Oh man, they're going, man!  I
                            think they're going for Burt!

               Val talks a little louder into the mic.  INTERCUT as needed.

                                          VAL
                            Burt!  This is Val!  Get out of
                            your basement!!  Take your radio!
                            You and Heather get up on your
                            roof!  Then we'll talk, okay?!

                                          BURT (V.O.)
                            Val?  What the hell you doing back
                            already?

                                          VAL
                                   (shouts)
                            Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof
                            or someplace!  We found out what's
                            been killing people!  They're under
                            the ground!

                                          BURT (V.O.)
                            What's under the ground?  We're not
                            getting up on the roof.  Earth
                            shelter's the best.  Known that
                            since I was a kid.

                                          VAL
                            Listen!  Listen!  We know what they
                            are!  They're big things under the
                            ground!  Much bigger than we
                            thought!  They're coming after you!
                            They're coming right now!


         101   INT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY                101

               Hearing that warning, Burt and Heather go into a well-honed
               drill.  They grab their hunting rifles and take positions at
               basement windows.  Burt scans with the binoculars.  He sees
               nothing.  He glances at Heather.  She shrugs.  Nobody coming.

                                          BURT
                                   (into CB)
                            We don't see anything, Val.  Now
                            what the hell are you talking
                            about?  Over.

               Val is frantic.  How do you explain these things?

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            They're coming underground!  They
                            ...they can dig like a son of a
                            bitch...Big monsters under the
                            ground, Burt!  Now get the hell
                            out!  Hurry!

               Burt and Heather exchange looks.  Has Val gone nuts?  Then
               they hear a low RUMBLE, growing louder and louder.  Tools
               hanging over the work bench start to shake; the decorative
               cow skulls on the wall rattle; the overhead lights sway --
               and then -- everything stops.  Dead silence, except for the
               humming of the case cleaner.

               THEN THE WALL MOVES!!  The wood paneling bulges slightly.
               Nails pop out.  The wall is pushed again; the paneling
               cracks.  A cow skull falls.  Burt and Heather level their
               rifles and --

               A huge creature pushes right through the wall!  Fully half
               its bulbous, spiked body writhes into the center of the
               room, great multi-part jaws drooling open, hook-tentacles
               lashing out.


         102   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          102

               The three men can hear the chaos over the CB.

                                          BURT (V.O.)
                            Jesus Chri...!

               The CB goes dead.  The men stare numbly.  Then, drifting
               across the desert, a soft popping sound.  The men perk up;
               they know what it is -- distant gunfire.


         103   INT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY                103

               The gunfire is DEAFENING as Burt and Heather blast away.
               Globby blood spurts from a dozen wounds, and the creature
               pulls back a little.  The couple keeps firing until magazines
               are empty.  The creature lunges forward again.

               PAN with Burt and Heather to REVEAL a wall of the basement we
               haven't seen until now -- a wall covered with guns -- hand
               guns, long guns, riot guns, flare guns, antique guns,
               military guns, elephant guns.

               Heather grabs an HK-91 assault rifle, slams in two magazines,
               bottoms taped end to end, and opens fire!  A hook-tentacle
               snags her boot, yanking her right off her feet.  Burt pumps
               out eight devastating blasts from a twelve-gauge riot gun,
               severing the tentacle.  Heather is on her feet in an instant.
               She expertly flops her double magazine over, loading the full
               one taped upside-down to it, and opens fire again.  Burt
               grabs an AR-15 semi-auto and joins her.  They lay down
               massive fire, virtually disappearing in muzzle flash and
               smoke.  Ejected shell cases clatter and clang all around the
               room.

               The guns are empty.  THE CREATURE IS STILL COMING!  They back
               down the wall, desperately grabbing weapons one after
               another: a lever-action, a magnum handgun, even a flare gun
               which Heather fires right into the creature's mouth.
               Shrieking in pain, the horrid thing thing KEEPS WRIGGLING
               TOWARD THEM!

               Burt and Heather scramble up over a desk to keep something
               between them and it.  Burt smashes open a fancy glass case
               holding a huge four-gauge elephant gun.  He slams in two
               gigantic cartridges nearly an inch in diameter.  He fires.
               The concussion literally shakes the building.  The recoil
               slams Burt back against the wall.

               The monster bullets tear monster holes in the monster.  Great
               gouts of curdles blood spew from it -- Burt hit an artery or
               something.  The beast convulses grotesquely, then collapses,
               deflating like a beached whale.  Burt and Heather stagger
               together and hug each other fervently.  They stare dumbfounded
               at the massive dead horror.  Burt suddenly shouts vehemently:

                                          BURT
                            Broke into the wrong goddamn rec
                            room, didn't you, you BASTARD!


         104   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          104

               Val, Earl and Miguel listen to the silence hoping for some
               sign that their friends are alive.  Suddenly:

                                          BURT (V.O. filter)
                            We killed it!  You got that?  We
                            killed that motherfucker!  Come
                            back!

               It takes a moment for this to sink in, then the men CHEER --
               as quietly as possible.

                                          VAL
                            Uh...roger that, Burt.  Uh,
                            congratulations.  Uh, be advised,
                            however, there are four more,
                            repeat, four more motherfuckers.
                            Come back.


         105   EXT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                    105

               Burt and Heather dash out onto the roof, laden with weapons,
               ammo boxes and their CB radio.  They hit the deck, assorted
               rifles and the elephant gun the ready.


         106   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          106

               Val shouts to everyone:

                                          VAL
                            They got one!  They killed one of
                            the sons of bitches!


         107   EXT.  STORAGE SHED - ROOF - DAY                              107

               Melvin pumps his fist in the air.

                                          MELVIN
                            Way to go, dudes!


         108   EXT. THE STERNGOOD HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                        108

               Nancy and Mindy hug each other.


         109   EXT.  NESTOR'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                            109

               Perched on his Spanish tile roof, Nestor pours coffee from
               his thermos and raises his cup in a toast.


         110   EXT.  WATER TOWER - DAY                                      110

               Rhonda lets out a WHOOP.


         111   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          111

               The men sit, temporarily jubilant.

                                          EARL
                            Well, I guess we don't get to make
                            fun of Burt's lifestyle anymore,
                            huh?

               Val grabs the CB mic.

                                          VAL
                            Burt, any chance you can get the
                            rest of them?


         112   EXT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                    112

               Burt and Heather peer from their fortress-like roof.  Burt
               spots earth bulging up near the foundation of his house.

                                          BURT
                                   (into CB)
                            One second, Val.

               He grabs the elephant gun and takes two well-aimed shots --
               two deafening BOOMS which echo off the distant mountains.
               But the bullets bury themselves harmlessly in the dirt.  The
               bulge in the dirt moves calmly away and sinks from view.
               Heather shakes her head.

                                          HEATHER
                            You're not getting any penetration,
                            even with the elephant gun.

                                          BURT
                            Damn!
                                   (into CB)
                            Val, we can't get them.  Never
                            figured on having to shoot through
                            dirt!  Best goddamn bullet stop
                            there is.  Come back.


         113   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          113

               The men are disappointed.  That's not what they wanted to
               hear from Burt.  Then Earl perks up and grab the CB mic.

                                          EARL
                                   (into CB)
                            Okay, Burt, listen.  Forget
                            shooting them.  Tell me this: can
                            you get to your truck?

                                          BURT (V.O.)
                            No problem.

                                          EARL
                            Good.  You've got the only truck in
                            the valley that can make it up that
                            damn jeep trail.  So, here's the
                            plan: You and Heather go for help.
                            Get to the mountains...

               But Rhonda interrupts, pointing urgently from the water
               tower.

                                          RHONDA
                            Hey, guys!  They're up to
                            something.

               Val, Earl and Miguel rush to the edge of the roof and look
               down where she's pointing --

               A creature is running its tentacles along the building's
               foundation.  It's a strange, more studied movement than we've
               seen before.

                                          VAL
                                   (to Rhonda)
                            What's it doing?

                                          RHONDA
                            Why do you all keep asking me?

               They all stare nervously down as the tentacles feel their way
               along the wall, moving toward a corner of the building.
               Suddenly Miguel spots something down the next wall.

                                          MIGUEL
                            Hey, there's another one coming!

               Another set of tentacles is feeling along the adjacent wall.
               The two creatures meet at the corner, their tentacles touch-
               ing rather like ants' antennae.  They they submerge; tenta-
               cles zipping into the earth.  Nothing happens for a moment.

               Then the corner of the building suddenly heaves up a couple
               of feet.  Clapboard siding splits.  A warped window shatters.
               (We don't see the creatures, only the effect of their shoving
               from below).  The men nearly lose their balance.  Then the
               corner sinks back down.

                                          EARL
                            What the hell was that all about?


         114   EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    114

               Nancy and Mindy are still huddled on the roof.  They don't
               make a sound.  They're startled when the house suddenly
               groans and tilts as creatures give it a tentative shove.
               Nancy and Mindy frantically cling to the peak of the smooth
               roof.  The picture windows shatters.  We hear beams POP and
               CRACK, dishes CRASH off shelves.  The front screen door
               swings open.  At last the house slowly settles back down.


         115   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          115

               The men are watching Nancy's house tensely.

                                          MIGUEL
                            They weren't making no noise.
                            Why they bothering them for?

                                          VAL
                                   (mind racing)
                            They're studying the buildings...
                            trying to figure them out.

               Rhonda chimes in from the water tower.

                                          RHONDA
                            Yeah, they're confused.  They can
                            feel our vibrations, but they can't
                            find us.

                                          VAL
                            They're working together, too.

                                          EARL
                            Yeah, like they got a plan...

                                          BURT (V.O.)
                            Breaker there, Earl.  What do you
                            want us to do?

                                          EARL
                                   (into CB)
                            Hang on, Burt.  The bastards are up
                            to something.


         116   EXT.  NESTOR'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                            116

               Straddling the peak of his steeply sloping roof.  Nestor
               grabs on in panic as the creatures lift the place up slowly!
               The roof warps, Spanish tiles shatter and rain down on the
               ground.

               This causes a flurry of activity.  Tentacles snake around
               where the tiles fell.  We hear creatures crash through
               inside, snorting and huffing.  They attack the house in
               earnest, shaking it violently, pushing the front wall out
               till it falls flat.  The roof collapses on that side!  Nestor
               can't hang on!  He slides all the way down, landing across a
               window on the flattened wall.  The next instant he's grabbed
               and pulled through the window, right into the ground.  He
               SCREAMS!

               DOLLY along the ground, heading toward the storage shed where
               Melvin is.  All we can see is dirt, but we can still hear
               Nestor screaming UNDERGROUND!  His screams get more and more
               faint as DOLLY ENDS on:


         117   EXT.  STORAGE SHED - DAY                                     117

               CLOSE ON horrified Melvin as he rocks back and forth
               autistically.

                                          MELVIN
                            Oh, wow, man!  No way!  No fucking
                            way, man...!


         118   EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                             118

               Nancy comforts Mindy.


         119   EXT.  WATER TOWER - DAY                                      119

               Rhonda turns away.


         120   EXT.  PHAM CAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          120

               Val, Earl and Miguel stare in horror and disbelief.  Miguel
               crosses himself.  They're in worse trouble than they thought.

                                          VAL
                            They knocked his place down on
                            purpose, man.  They're gonna tear
                            this whole town out from under us!


         121   EXT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - DAY                           121

               Burt and Heather's truck is parked in foreground.  The couple
               is up on the roof in background.  Burt prowls along the edge
               of the roof with the elephant gun.  Heather mans the C.B.

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            Burt!  Heather!

                                          HEATHER
                            Yeah, Val.

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            We're in deep shit over here.
                            Let's change that plan.

               A hump of dirt raises near the base of the house.  Burt jerks
               the rifle to his shoulder and squeezes off a shot.  The hump
               moves away from the house.

                                          HEATHER
                            Knock it off, Burt!

                                          BURT
                            I think I scared it!

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            Forget going for help.  We'll all
                            be dead long before you get back.

               Still moving away, the hump of dirt passes under the side-
               walk, rippling the flagstones gently.

                                          HEATHER
                                   (into CB)
                            We're here, Val.  Just tell us what
                            you need.  Come back.

                                          VAL (V.O.)
                            They're tearing down the houses
                            here!  We all gotta get outta here
                            together!  Now!

               The hump of dirt passes under Burt and Heather's truck,
               rocking the vehicle slightly.

                                          HEATHER
                            We're with you, Val.  We'll come
                            get everybody.  Just hang on tight.

               The truck's security alarm starts BOOPING!  Burt and Heather
               stare down helplessly as the noisy truck is furiously
               attacked by the frenzied creatures.  Dust flies as metal rips
               and tires shred.


         122   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          122

               Val Earl and Miguel listen in disbelief to the distant truck
               alarm.  It finally sputters and dies.

                                          HEATHER (V.O.)
                            Val, we're going to have to forget
                            about the truck...

                                          VAL
                                   (into CB)
                            Yeah, Heather, we got you.

               They've hit rock-bottom.  They sit in helpless, desperate
               silence.

               Over on the storage shed roof, Melvin is losing it:

                                          MELVIN
                            Hey, you better think of something,
                            man!  You gotta do something!

                                          EARL
                            Who?

                                          MELVIN
                            You and Val, man!

               Miguel nods in agreement.  Val and Earl stare at him,
               incredulous.

                                          VAL
                            What?!!  Since when the hell's
                            every goddamn thing up to us?!

                                          RHONDA
                                   (flatly)
                            You guys do all the odd jobs.

               Val just stares at her.

               Then -- CRASH!  The store shudders, creaks, and groans.  The
               creatures are back.  One corner of the store lifts up, beams
               splintering.  Then another corner lifts up!  The roof tilts
               like the deck of a storm-tossed ship.  From now on the
               monsters shake and ram the building almost constantly.
               Hanging on tight, the men peer over the edge.

                                          EARL
                            We don't have a hell of a lot of
                            time here.

               Meanwhile, Rhonda tries her desperate best to be logical:

                                          RHONDA
                            Look, the situation hasn't changed.
                            We still have to get to solid rock.
                            There must be some way!

                                          VAL
                                   (shouts, angry)
                            Like what?!  There's nothing left
                            that'll make it to the mountains!

                                          MIGUEL
                            Hey, Val, quiet, man!

                                          VAL
                            We need a helicopter is what we
                            need, or a goddamn tank...

                                          EARL
                            Wait a minute...the Cat.  Could we
                            take the Cat?

                                          VAL
                                   (dubious)
                            Jesus.  It's slower than hell.

                                          EARL
                            Yeah, but it weighs better than
                            thirty tons.  No way they could
                            stop it.

                                          MIGUEL
                            We can't all fit on that bulldozer.

               But Val is warming to the idea.

                                          VAL
                            But...we could pull something!  We
                            could, I don't know, drag a car
                            behind it!

                                          EARL
                            A car, huh?  Like a big armored
                            car?  Need something bigger,
                            tougher...our truck maybe...or,
                            hell, that old semi trailer!

                                          VAL
                            Its tires are flat...

                                          EARL
                            Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull
                            anything.

                                          VAL
                            Well...all right!  We just roll on
                            out of here!

                                          EARL
                            We got a plan!

               They squint at the bulldozer -- 'way in the distance.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            'Course, that's one helluva long
                            walk.

               They stare grimly, momentarily stuck for an idea.  Then:

                                          RHONDA
                            Listen, they only respond to
                            vibration, right?  Couldn't we...
                            distract them somehow?

                                          VAL
                            Yeah, good!  Something to keep them
                            busy.  We need a decoy.

                                          EARL
                            Hey, Melvin, you wanna make a buck?

                                          MELVIN
                            Fuck you!

               Miguel grabs Earl and points down at little garden tractor in
               a jumble of Pham Van's equipment and tools near the side of
               the store.

                                          MIGUEL
                            Hey, how about the tractor?  Start
                            him up.  Let him go by itself.  Let
                            those things chase it all over is
                            they like that noise.

                                          EARL
                                   (nodding)
                            Not bad.
                                   (to Val)
                            What do you think?

               The store takes a heavy hit.  The front porch collapses with
               a terrific crash.

                                          VAL
                            I think the ground's getting
                            closer.  I think we do it.  We're
                            gonna save our asses here!

                                          RHONDA
                            Wait!  How are you going to know
                            they're all following it?

                                          VAL
                            Good point.

                                          EARL
                            We got two right here.

               Val scrambles to the highest point of the sagging roof and
               shouts to Nancy.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Nancy, we gotta find all four of
                            them.  How many you got over there?


         123   EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                             123

               The house shuddering and shaking.

                                          NANCY
                            There's one.  I think one.


         124   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          124

               Earl grabs the CB mic.

                                          EARL
                                   (into CB)
                            Burt, Heather, we got a little sort
                            of a plan going here, maybe.  Can
                            you tell if you've still got any of
                            those things out at your place?
                            Come back.


         125   EXT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                    125

                                          BURT
                                   (into CB)
                            Yeah, still got one poking around.

                                          EARL (V.O.)
                            That's four.  Let us know if it
                            starts moving, Burt.

                                          BURT
                            Roger that.


         126   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - TRACTOR - DAY                       126

               Val and Earl have lowered Miguel down to a window sill right
               above the garden tractor.  He has used his kerchief to tie
               the steering wheel to keep the front wheels straight.  He
               jams the throttle open and signals thumbs-up to Val and Earl
               above.


         127   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          127

               Val and Earl stride purposefully toward the opposite end of
               the roof.  Realizing they have the same idea, each one tries
               to edge ahead of the other.

                                          VAL
                            I'm making the run to the Cat.

                                          EARL
                            Like hell you are.

                                          VAL
                            Get real.  I'm faster than you.

                                          EARL
                            I'm best at driving the Cat.

                                          VAL
                            Only if something happens to me.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            Look, you'd better listen.  I'm
                            older and wiser.

                                          VAL
                            Yeah, well, you're half right.

               Earl raises a fist: The Challenge.  They do scissors-rock-
               paper.  One, two, three.  Val loses.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Damn.  Guess I have to do it.

                                          EARL
                                   (shakes his head)
                            I won.  I pick who does it.

               Val glares at him.  Earl's obviously determined.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            Ready when you are, Miguel!

               Earl positions himself, nervous as hell, ready to leap at the
               right moment.


         128   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - TRACTOR - DAY                       128

               Miguel leans out precariously and pulls the tractor's starter
               cord.  Nothing.  On the second try it starts.  He slams it
               into gear and sends it out toward open desert.  The store
               shakes under Miguel, almost knocking him off the window sill,
               as two humps of dirt pursue the noisy tractor.

                                          MIGUEL
                            There they go!  They're chasing it!


         129   EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    129

               A "spout" of dust erupts near the foundation as the creature
               beneath zooms away toward the new sound.  Nancy whispers:

                                          NANCY
                            It's going...
                                   (then shouts)
                            There goes this one!  It's going!


         130   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          130

               The CB radio squawks:

                                          BURT (V.O.)
                            Hey, this guy just took off like a
                            shot.  What'd you people do?

               Earl is poised to leap.  Val steps up and slaps him on the
               back.

                                          VAL
                            Watch your ass, shithead.

                                          EARL
                            Don't worry about me, jerkoff.

               Val instantly elbows Earl hard in the stomach.  As Earl
               doubles over, Val springs off the edge of the roof.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            You goddamn suicidal son of a
                            bitch!

               We see Val running for all he's worth -- and there's the
               bulldozer at the edge of town a long way away.


         131   EXT.  DESERT - DAY                                           131

               LOW CAMERA pursues the garden tractor as it bounces along.


         132   EXT.  PERFECTION - DAY                                       132

               Val charges across the vast open area that separates him from
               the bulldozer.  We can hear the tractor droning along in the
               background.


         133   EXT.  DESERT - DAY                                           133

               The tractor suddenly takes a bad bounce and flips over!  The
               engine dies.  Total silence.


         134   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          134

               Earl, Rhonda and Miguel have seen the tractor take a header.

                                          EARL
                            Oh my God!


         135   EXT.  EDGE OF TOWN - VAL - DAY                               135

               Val's crunching boots seem incredibly loud in the sudden
               silence.  He hesitates, glancing over his shoulder.  He's
               totally out in the open, halfway to the bulldozer.  Should he
               run back or go forward?  He decides to go for the bulldozer.


         136   EXT.  DESERT - DAY                                           136

               All four creatures are now heading for Val.  INTERCUT four
               slightly different LOW CAMERA ANGLES speeding over the
               ground, racing after him.  He strains to the limit, breaths
               coming in painful rasps -- but the creatures are closing in
               on him with chilling ease.


         137   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          137

               Everyone watches in horror.

                                          EARL
                            He'll never make it!  They're gonna
                            get him!

                                          RHONDA
                                   (yells)
                            VAL, STOP!  THEY'RE COMING!  DON'T
                            MOVE!


         138   EXT.  EDGE OF TOWN - VAL - DAY                               138

               Val hears her and stops dead.  So do the creatures.  Maybe
               twenty feet away, their giant snouts poke up out of the
               ground: one, two, three, four.  Val stands trembling.  The
               creatures softly shuffle back and forth, searching blindly
               for him, hook-tentacles feeling everywhere.  One tentacle
               sweeps toward Val's boot.  He manages to lift his foot just
               in time, letting the tentacle pass beneath it.  He balances
               precariously like a flamingo.


         139   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          139

                                          EARL
                            It worked!  They can't find him!
                                   (pause)
                            Okay, okay...uh...we gotta make
                            some noise...a lot of noise!  HEY,
                            YOU SORRY SONS OF BITCHES, COME AND
                            GET ME...!!!!

               He starts jumping noisily up and down.  Miguel joins in,
               cursing the monsters in Spanish.



         139A  EXT.   WATER TOWER - DAY                                     139A

               Rhonda kicks and shouts.  But it's obvious they need some-
               thing louder.  She spots the aging outlet pipe coming from
               the water tank.  Bracing herself, she kicks at it with both
               feet.  It finally gives way at a rusted joint.  A torrent of
               water blasts out, thundering into the dirt.


         140   EXT.  EDGE OF TOWN - VAL - DAY                               140

               All the creatures wheel about in the dirt and zoom off toward
               town.  Val breathes a big sigh of relief and sprints to the
               bulldozer.


         141   EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - ROOF - DAY                          141

                                          EARL
                            That did it, girl!  Goddamn good
                            thinking!


         142   EXT.  WATER TOWER - DAY                                      142

               A mass of tentacles and snouts swirl through the big puddle
               where the water if falling.  The creatures' breathing throws
               up spouts of muddy water.  Rhonda looks down nervously.  Earl
               calls reassuringly from Pham Van's:

                                          EARL
                            Don't worry.  No way they can lift
                            that tower.  I mean it's really
                            heavy.


         143   INSERT - CONCRETE FOOTING                                    143

               The dirt begins to cave in around the tower's footing.  The
               creatures are digging the dirt away!


         144   BACK TO SCENE                                                144

               The water tower tilts ever so slightly, creaking and
               groaning!  Rhonda frantically grabs a handhold.

                                          RHONDA
                            They're not trying to lift it!


         145   EXT.  BULLDOZER - DAY                                        145

               Val lands in the driver's seat and turns the engine over --
               it doesn't start!

                                          VAL
                            NO FUCKING WAY!

               The old machine starts.  Val slams it into reverse and backs
               up toward the semi trailer.


         146   EXT.  WATER TOWER - DAY                                      146

               The water tower is starting to tilt seriously.  Water spills
               over the top edge of the tank, drenching Rhonda.


         147   EXT.  BULLDOZER - DAY                                        147

               Val has used heavy chains on the back of the bulldozer to
               jerry-rig a hitch to the semi trailer.   Now he scrambles
               back into the driver's seat.  He guns the engine, wrenching
               the old semi trailer from years of dried mud and tumbleweeds.
               Ancient tires disintegrate.  Rusted wheels screech and
               complain -- but it moves.  Val lets out a whoop and heads
               full-tilt for town.  He's suddenly shocked as he sees:


         148   EXT.  WATER TOWER - DAY                                      148

               Rhonda's in big trouble.  She scrambles to the high side of
               the tower platform.  The tower's going to tip over at any
               moment!  It's roof slides off and crashes into the street!

               On Pham Van's, Miguel and Earl are tearing apart the swamp
               cooler, throwing pieces of it off the roof, trying to
               distract the creatures, but they can't compete with the noise
               from the water.

               In BG the bulldozer rumbles toward the tower at top speed --
               an excruciatingly slow eight miles per hour.

               The tremendously heavy water tank suddenly tears loose,
               sliding off its platform, nearly carrying Rhonda with it.
               She ends up hanging from a cross beam as the water tank
               splatters like an enormous egg below, sending a small tidal
               wave down the street.

               The remains of the tower tilt crazily nearly forty-five
               degrees.  The bulldozer grinds closer and closer.  Rhonda
               tries to climb up, but the jostling and shuddering of the
               tower keeps her dangling precariously.  Suddenly she falls!

               And lands in the dirt.  The creatures zero in on her!  She
               turns wildly and leaps for the blade of the approaching
               bulldozer.  The blade is only inches off the ground but Val
               swiftly raises it, lifting Rhonda high into the air just
               above the grasping tentacles!


         149   EXT.  PERFECTION - MAIN STREET - DAY                         149

               As Rhonda climbs down into the cab, Val heads the bulldozer
               over to Pham Van's and stops.  Almost as soon as he does,
               creatures attack, a frenzy of tentacles grabbing at all sides
               of the massive earth-moving machine, slithering into the
               treads.  Val and Rhonda watch this nervously as Earl and
               Miguel quickly clamber from the roof down into the protective
               steel belly of the semi trailer.

               Val mentally crosses his fingers and sends the bulldozer
               roaring forward.  It effortlessly tears loose from the
               tentacles, grinding one to pulp in its treads.  The creature
               shrieks in pain.  The humans cheer!  At last they've got the
               upper hand!


         150   EXT.  STORAGE SHED - DAY                                     150

               Melvin dances merrily, and noisily, on the metal rooftop.

                                          MELVIN
                            Way to go!  Dumb fucking worms!
                            Now haul ass over here, man!  Me
                            next!  Get me off of here...!

               The flimsy shed seems almost to explode as a furious creature
               roars up inside.  The walls buckle out.  The whole structure
               sags.  Melvin scrambles to peak of the roof.

                                          MELVIN
                            Oh shit!  Oh, God!  Help!

               As the unseen creature thrashes around inside the shed, the
               walls topple outward and the roof drops to the ground like a
               pancake.  Melvin has lost all self control and just keeps
               screaming.  Val pulls along side, jumps down onto the tread,
               and reaches out to Melvin.  But just as they join hands, the
               creature hits the roof from beneath, dragging it several
               feet.  Val is yanked off the bulldozer and lands with Nelvin
               on the roof!

               The creature slams into the roof repeatedly, but the
               corrugated metal is both light and resilient.  It bends, but
               the frustrated monster can't get enough "bite" to tear
               through it.  Val and Melvin straddle the peak of the roof,
               trying desperately to hang on as it heaves up, buckling like a
               bronco.

               Earl scrambles into the bulldozer driver's seat and heads
               after them at full throttle, the big diesel roaring.

               Melvin and Val prepare to jump onto the bulldozer, but just
               before it reaches them the roof suddenly starts to slide like
               some mad flying carpet, carried from beneath by a creature!
               Val hangs on like a rodeo rider, struggling to keep fear-
               crazed Melvin from tumbling off.


         151   EXT.  DIRT DITCH - DAY                                       151

               The roof zigs and zags, spins and twists.  Melvin and Val
               won't be shaken loose.  Earl does his best to head it off,
               but it's hard to predict which way the roof will scoot next.

               The rood careens alongside the edge of a dirt-walled drainage
               ditch, then suddenly skitters sideways and plunges over the
               edge.  Melvin and Val tumble to the bottom.  As they jump to
               their feet:

                                          VAL
                            We got about three seconds!

               Val sees, almost right above them, an exposed pipe which
               spans the ditch.  He shoves Melvin toward it.  They leap up
               and grab the pipe, pulling their legs up as high as they can.
               An instant later, the creature blasts through one wall of the
               ditch, roars past beneath them and burrows into the opposite
               wall!

               Earl brings the bulldozer to a thundering stop next to them.

                                          EARL
                            Well, come on!


         152   EXT.   NANCY'S HOUSE - DAY                                   152

               Nancy and Mindy huddle together on their roof.  The upraised
               scoop blade of the bulldozer comes INTO SHOT with Val riding
               it.  He helps them step across into it.


         153   EXT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                    153

               Burt is using a hacksaw to cut lengths from a heavy vertical
               pipe to which his TV antenna was anchored.  Heather works
               with the sections Burt has already cut off.  She is filling
               them with gunpowder from reloading cannisters and hammering
               the ends shut -- they're making bombs.

               Then they hear rumbling.  What is it, more creatures?  They're
               surprised by the odd sight of the strange contraption
               approaching.

                                          BURT
                                   (impressed)
                            God damn!  Armored transport!

               Val climbs up on the bulldozer roll cage so he's about even
               with Heather and Burt.  A creature occasionally slams into the
               underside of the bulldozer of the semi trailer, rocking them
               slightly, throwing up clouds of dust.

                                          VAL
                            Let's go you two.  We're headed for
                            the mountains.

                                          BURT
                            In a minute.

               He grabs a coil of blackpowder cannon fuse.  He cuts off a
               length and stuffs it in the end of one of the pipe bombs
               during:

                                          VAL
                            Come on, Burt, we can't hold still
                            long.  They're damn smart and
                            getting smarter by the minute.

               Burt hefts the finished bomb.

                                          BURT
                            That's fine.  We've got some new
                            things to teach them.

                                          VAL
                            Damn it!  They'll sink this rig
                            just like a boat!

               Just then the bulldozer starts to tilt sideways, creatures
               digging dirt away beneath it.  Earl guns it forward out of
               the depression they're making.

                                          EARL
                            See that?  They're doing it now!
                            They try it every time we hold
                            still.

               Burt and Heather are impressed.  They rush around the
               rooftop, gathering food, ammo, guns, the finished bombs,
               handing them to impatient Val who hands them down to people
               in the semi trailer during:

                                          VAL
                            Jesus Christ, we're only going nine
                            miles.  Be there in two hours, tops!

                                          BURT
                            Yeah, well those things are gonna
                            be on our ass every foot of the
                            way, right?

               He holds up to rifles to Heather, the HK91 assault rifle and
               another elephant gun.

                                          BURT
                            What do you think?  Max firepower
                            or...?

                                          HEATHER
                            I'd go for penetration.  The 458
                            shooting solids -- less ammo to
                            carry anyway.

               Burt nods.  Everyone on the bulldozer and semi trailer shouts:

                                          TOWNSFOLK
                                   (adlib)
                            Come on!
                            Who cares!
                            Forget it!
                            Let's go!

               Dust flies up.  The bulldozer tilts.  Earl guns it forward
               again.  Heather and Burt grab a few more things and leap down
               into the semi trailer.

                                          MELVIN
                            Give me a gun!  I'll take one!

                                          BURT
                            I wouldn't give you a gun if it was
                            World War Three.

               Earl pilots the strange looking contraption out into the
               desert.  Burt and Heather watch their fortress-home recede.

                                          BURT
                            Food for five years.  A thousand
                            gallons of gas.  Air filtration.
                            Water filtration.  Geiger counter.
                            Bomb shelter...
                                   (looks heavenward)
                            ...underground goddamn monsters?!

               Heather puts a consoling arm around him.


         154   EXT.  JEEP TRAIL - DAY                                       154

               The bulldozer easily lumbers along the really rough road we
               saw Val and Earl's truck struggle over the other morning.

               As they come closer we see Burt and Heather riding "shotgun,"
               he sitting out in the bulldozer's scoop, she on the rear of
               the semi trailer, elephant guns at the ready.  Val, Earl and
               Rhonda are in the cab.


         155   EXT.  CLIFFS - DAY                                           155

               It's late afternoon, sun casting dramatic shadows across the
               beautiful desert.  We are WIDE on the bizarre vehicle,
               resolutely grinding along not far from the cliffs, nearing
               the mountains ahead.


         156   EXT.  DESERT - BULLDOZER - DAY                               156

               As they scan the desert, the people are feeling like they may
               get out of this after all.  Earl calls back to the people in
               the semi trailer.

                                          EARL
                            Any sign of'em?

                                          MIGUEL
                            Maybe they just gave up, you know.

                                          MELVIN
                            Yeah, the bulldozer's too much for
                            them, man.

               As they top a gentle rise, Burt excitedly points ahead.

                                          BURT
                            There we go, solid rock!

               Everyone cheers.  But then Heather points up ahead to one
               side.

                                          HEATHER
                            What's that?


         157   P.O.V. - THE GROUP - DUST CLOUD - DAY                        157

               Perhaps two hundred yards from them, a huge cloud of dust
               wells up from behind big boulders.


         158   BACK TO SCENE                                                158

               Everyone stares uneasily at the billowing cloud.

                                          NANCY
                            Is it them?

                                          MIGUEL
                            What else could it be?

                                          MINDY
                            What're they doing?

                                          MELVIN
                            Maybe they're taking a dump.

                                          RHONDA
                            We're not going over there, right?

                                          EARL
                            No.  We go straight.

                                          VAL
                            Damn it.  What the hell are they
                            doing?  They're up to something.

                                          EARL
                            I don't care what they're doing as
                            long as they're doing it way over
                            there.

               Earl shoves the throttle all the way.  The engine screams.


         159   EXT.  DESERT - DUSTCLOUD - DAY                               159

               We MOVE IN through the cloud of dust.  Dirt is flying by the
               ton out of en eight foot diameter hole in the ground.  A huge
               mound of the tunneled-out dirt is already piled high.  The
               creatures are digging a tunnel -- but why?


         160   EXT.  DESERT - BULLDOZER - DAY                               160

               We watch the bulldozer rumbling along.  It seems unstop-
               able.  The mountains and safety are barely a mile away --

               when the EARTH CAVES IN!!  THE BULLDOZER PLUNGES NOSE FIRST
               INTO AN UNSEEN PIT DUG JUST BENEATH THE SURFACE!

               The machine ends up half-buried at a steep angle.  The semi
               trailer is right on the edge of the pit.  Everyone is shaken,
               bruised, bloodied.  Val, Earl and Rhonda look frantically for
               Burt, who was riding out front in the scoop.  They're
               relieved to see him clawing his way out of pit.  Val hauls
               him up and all four of them now leap into the semi trailer.
               As they come to rest, Val slowly realizes what's happened.

                                          VAL
                            They...they dug a trap!  I can't
                            believe this!

               The idling bulldozer engine coughs and dies.  There is a
               moment's crushing silence.

               Then the dreaded digging begins.  Dust boils up around the
               semi trailer -- creatures digging from below!  The semi
               trailer shakes and shudders, slowly sinking.  The people
               huddle together in sheer panic.  Val and Earl grab the
               nearest of Burt and Heather's guns and fire wildly, hope-
               lessly, down at the dirt.  Ricochets whine into the distance.

               Burt grimly digs an overloaded knapsack for one of his
               pipe bombs.  He leaps up between Val and Earl and lights the
               fuse, looking for a target.

                                          BURT
                            Hungry?!  Eat this!!

               He tosses the bomb at some churning earth and dives back into
               the semi trailer.

                                          BURT (cont'd)
                            Keep your heads down!

               KABOOM!  The explosion throws up a big plume of dust and
               rocks.  We hear a new, very strange sound of pain from the
               creatures.  The semi trailer instantly stops shaking.  The
               creatures have stopped digging.  All is quiet.

               The people peer up over the edge of the semi trailer, looking
               all around.  Then:

                                          RHONDA
                            There they are!


         161   P.O.V. THE GROUP - DISTANT CREATURES                         161

               Numerous spurts of dust mark their paths as they race madly
               away, fanning out from the semi trailer.


         162   BACK TO SCENE                                                162

                                          MIGUEL
                            Hey, Burt...did you get one...!

                                          RHONDA
                            No, there's still four of them.
                            See...there's like four different
                            dust trails.

                                          VAL
                            Sure got their attention, though.
                            Nice going, Burt.
                                   (to Earl)
                            Earl, what about the Cat?

               Earl's already staring down at the bulldozer.

                                          EARL
                            No way.  It's down for the count.

               Val looks around.


         163   P.O.V.  VAL - ROCK OUTCROP                                   163

               Toward the cliffs he sees a big rock outcrop.


         164   BACK TO SCENE                                                164

               Rhonda points in the opposite direction from where Val is
               looking.

                                          RHONDA
                            Here they come!  They're coming
                            back!

               Heather unexpectedly fire two deafening blasts from her
               elephant gun at the approaching creatures, then shakes her
               head, frustrated.  They're still coming.

                                          VAL
                            Come on, everybody!  We gotta run
                            for those rocks over there!

                                          EARL
                            Jesus, Val, it's pretty far.

                                          MELVIN
                            Yeah, man!  They'll get us!

                                          VAL
                            There sure as hell get us if we
                            stay here!

                                          RHONDA
                            Wait, wait, listen.  Burt do you
                            have any more of those things?

                                          BURT
                            The bombs?  Damn right I do.

                                          RHONDA
                            Well, what is you throw one that
                            way, the way we want to go...
                                   (points toward rocks)
                            Then, when the explosion happens...
                            if it drives them away again...we
                            all run like goddamn bastards!
                                   (to Earl)
                            Pardon my French.

               Wham!  With a jolt the semi trailer begins shaking and
               shuddering again -- sinking, smiling.

                                          MELVIN
                            What if it doesn't scare them?
                            What if they don't run?

                                          RHONDA
                            I don't think it does scare them!
                            It hurts them!  They're  so
                            sensitive to sound, they have to
                            run!  It hurts too much!

               Glances all around.

                                          BURT
                            She's got my vote.

                                          VAL
                            Right.  We're gonna run.  Get
                            ready.

               Val squats in front of tear-streaked Mindy.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            Mindy, you understand what we're
                            going to do?
                                   (off her nod)
                            And don't worry, they can't get us
                            once we're on those rocks.

                                          MELVIN
                            I don't know, man.  They're too
                            fast!  You can't outrun them, no
                            way!

               As Burt readies another bomb, he pauses to hand bug-eyed
               Melvin a huge Ruger Super Redhawk 44 magnum handgun.

                                          BURT
                            Here, kid.  This'll make'em think
                            twice.

               Melvin's eyes bug out further.  Burt lights his bomb.

                                          BURT (cont'd)
                            Heads down!!

               He hurls the bomb.  Wait.  Wait.  WHOOOM!  Again we hear the
               creatures' unearthly shriek of pain.  Rhonda's on her feet
               before the rocks stop falling.  She spots the creatures.

                                          RHONDA
                            It worked!  There they go!

                                          VAL
                            LET'S DO IT!

               Earl lets out a war wild WHOOP.  It's infectious.  CRANE UP
               with them as everyone piles out of the semi trailer like
               soldiers out of a trench -- they charge across no-man's-land.

               Melvin runs like a demon.  He tries to shoot at the first
               thing he sees but the gun just clicks over and over -- empty.

                                          MELVIN
                            Burt, you bastard!

               Enraged, he doubles his speed, trying to overtake Burt.

               Mindy can't keep up.  Nancy tries to pull her along.  Val and
               Earl swoop in, grab Mindy under either arm, and carry her
               between them.


         165   ANGLE - THE CREATURES                                        165

               The ground heaves violently as the retreating monsters
               angrily wheel about and charge back after the humans.


         166   EXT.  DESERT - ROCK OUTCROP - DAY                            166

               Big slabs jutting this way and that -- a rock iceberg in a
               sand ocean.  The people scramble onto it amid whoops of joy
               and relief.  Melvin charges up to Burt:

                                          MELVIN
                            You asshole!  There's no bullets in
                            this gun!

                                          BURT
                            Got you moving, didn't it?

               Burt's line gets a laugh from people, but then tentacles
               burst up on all sides of the rock, probing, feeling.  The
               effect is instantly sobering.  Burt swiftly grabs out his
               remaining bombs -- six of them -- and holds one ready.  But
               they're in no immediate danger.

                                          EARL
                            So...now what?

                                          RHONDA
                            Could we make it to the mountains?

                                          VAL
                                   (gestures to Burt's bombs)
                            No way.  We'd need fifty of those
                            things.

               The hopelessness of the situation suddenly hits Val, Earl,
               and Rhonda.  After a moment:

                                          EARL
                            Well...that's it.  We're not
                            getting off this rock...

                                          VAL
                            Not going to pole vault anywhere.
                            That's for sure.

                                          HEATHER
                            What's the matter with you?  What
                            are you talking about?!

                                          RHONDA
                            They'll just wait out there till
                            we're dead.  That's what they do.

               As this sinks in, Burt loses his cool, igniting an argument.

                                          BURT
                            What?  Well, for chrissake, we
                            could have made a stand at our
                            place!  We had food, water...

                                          EARL
                            You can't fight'em that way...

                                          BURT
                            You two jackasses hauled us way the
                            hell out here...!?

                                          VAL
                            BACK OFF, BURT...!

                                          BURT
                            Well, who put you two in charge?

                                          NANCY
                                   (shouts)
                            Burt!  Those animals would have
                            killed you!

               Everyone stares in surprise at normally quiet Nancy.

                                          NANCY (cont'd)
                                   (softly)
                            You haven't seen what they can do.

                                          VAL
                                   (calmer)
                            They'd have dug your place out from
                            under you in half an hour!

               There's a long, grim silence.  Everyone sits glumly.
               Finally, Burt picks up a bomb and contemplates it:

                                          BURT
                                   (losing it)
                            If it comes to starvation, I know
                            what I'm doing.  Take one of these.
                            Walk right out there with the fuse
                            lit.  Stuff it down my pants and
                            let 'em take me down.  BOOOOM!

               Heather puts a soothing hand on his shoulder.

                                          HEATHER
                            Jesus, honey!

               But now Earl brightens a little.

                                          EARL
                            You know, that's not a bad idea!

               The others react.  Is Earl nuts?

                                          EARL
                            No, I mean, it gives me an idea...
                            going fishing like...


         167   EXT.  DESERT - ROCK OUTCROP - LATER                          167

               In the open desert, a rock lands.  Then another.  Val and
               Rhonda are throwing them from the rock outcrop.

               Val, Earl, Rhonda, and Burt have moved away from the main
               group to another section of the rock outcrop where
               intervening boulders will protect everyone from an explosion.

               Earl has tied a bomb to some nylon rope form one of Burt's
               knapsacks.  Burt places the other bombs safely out of the way
               behind a ledge.  Meanwhile, Val and Rhonda keep throwing
               rocks.  Soon, the ground shifts.

                                          VAL
                            There!  Right straight out in front
                            of you.

               Burt has his coil of fuse.

                                          BURT
                            How much you think?

                                          EARL
                            I don't know...  They're pretty
                            quick...fifteen seconds?

               Burt nods, expertly eyeballing a fifteen second length and
               snipping it off.  As he stuffs it into the bomb:

                                          EARL
                            What the hell is that, anyway?

                                          BURT
                            Cannon fuse.

                                          EARL
                            What do you use it for?

                                          BURT
                                   (matter of fact)
                            My cannon.

               The bomb is ready -- it's moment of truth.  Earl digs in his
               pocket for the lighter -- but Val has it.  Val nervously
               leans over to light the fuse, but then frowns as he sees how
               Earl is holding the rope.

                                          VAL
                            Come on, you're not going to do
                            your lasso thing...?

                                          EARL
                            Hey, just 'cause you're no good
                            with a rope...

               Val shakes his head and lights the fuse.  Earl whirls the
               bomb on the end of its rope like a lasso, and lets it fly out
               as far as he can.  Then he starts pulling it back in along
               the ground like a fishing lure.  Rhonda stares at her watch
               as they all sink down behind the protective boulder.

                                          RHONDA
                            Come on...come on...

                                          BURT
                            Take it...take the bait...

               Suddenly a snout subtly surfaces and gulps down the bomb.  A
               tense two seconds later -- KABOOOM!  Bullseye!  It's a
               volcano of gory creature parts.  They splatter all over!  The
               remaining creatures shriek and race away again.  The people
               cheer wildly.

                                                                    CUT TO:


         168   EXT.  DESERT - ROCK OUTCROP - LATER                          168

               Val, Earl, Rhonda, and Burt prepare to try again.  This time
               Val has the rope and a new bomb.  Rhonda stands by him, ready
               with the lighter.  Earl lobs rocks out into the desert.

                                          EARL
                            Where the hell are they?  Hope they
                            didn't wise up.

                                          RHONDA
                                   (pointing)
                            Nope, there!  That's one.

               Rhonda shakily lights the fuse.  Val heaves the bomb out and
               starts trolling.  The creature swallows it.  Everyone drops
               down behind the boulder, Val impulsively grabbing a second
               bomb. They tense with anticipatory glee -- but the creature
               suddenly spits its bomb back out!  It sails back right over
               their heads.  It strikes the rocks above them, skittering
               down a crevice and landing in -- BURT'S PILE OF BOMBS!

               Val, Earl, and Rhonda scatter.  Burt dives backward over a
               rock ledge.

               BABABAMMM!!  All the bombs explode, throwing rocks every-
               where.  The creatures streak away.  Val, Earl and Rhonda
               sprawl into the dirt, half stunned.

               When the panic is over, Val and Earl realize where they are --
               fifty yards out in open desert!  So is Rhonda, off at an
               angle from them!  Only Burt is safe on the rock outcrop.

               And the creatures are coming back fast!

               The stranded trio starts back for the outcrop, but the
               creatures burst up ahead of them -- one blocking Rhonda's
               path, the other two cutting Val and Earl off!  The creatures
               roar toward their easy prey!

               Val and Earl freeze.  The ground bulges as the creatures
               "skid" to a halt not ten feet from them.  Rhonda stands stock
               still some fifty feet away, eyeing her own creature.

               Over on the outcrop with the main group of people Heather
               sizes up the situation.

                                          HEATHER
                            Make noise.  Everybody!  COME ON!

               Everyone starts hopping up and down, yelling, screaming, and
               clapping.  Burt even runs a few feet out from the rocks,
               firing a pistol into the dirt.

                                          BURT
                            COME ON, YOU SLIMEBAGS!  OVER HERE!
                            FRESH MEAT...!

               The crowd keeps up the ruckus.  The creatures are distracted
               by the noise, but this time they don't automatically go after
               it.  Their big snouts turn uncertainly this way and that.
               But they just stay where they are.  Their hook-tentacles
               slide out, feeling all around.  Earl whispers:

                                          EARL
                            They're not falling for it!

               Heather takes careful aim with her elephant gun.

                                          HEATHER
                            I'll make'em pay attention
                            goddamnit...

               But before she can fire, the creatures mysteriously sink from
               view.  Val, Rhonda, and Earl remain frozen.  What the hell is
               going on?  Nothing happens -- then --

               A HUGE HUMP OF EARTH suddenly wells up near Rhonda.  It sinks
               back down as fast as it appeared.  It's like the creature
               suddenly lifted its whole body almost to the surface then
               submerged again.  Another hump rises and falls right near Val
               and Earl.  There's a pause as the men whisper:

                                          VAL
                            They're...they're trying to make us
                            move!

                                          EARL
                            Or just knock us over.  Look, use
                            the bomb!

                                          VAL
                            It's out last one.  We can't kill
                            them all.

               The creatures try another random "barrage" of humps, some
               coming perilously close.  They know they'll eventually topple
               their prey.  One comes so close to Val and Earl that pebbles
               roll down its sides into their boots!

                                          EARL
                            Use the fucking bomb!

                                          VAL
                            So, we get back on that rock and in
                            three days we're dead anyway.

                                          EARL
                                   (slowly; terrified)
                            I want to live for the three days.

               More humps rise and fall.  Val gives in.  He signals Rhonda,
               gesturing with the bomb.  She understands.  He'll set it off,
               driving away the creatures, and they'll all run back to the
               outcrop.

               Val digs for the lighter.  Doesn't have it.  Earl digs for
               it, too.  But he doesn't have it either!  They go dead pale.
               How can that be?  They look across fifty feet of deadly open
               ground -- trembling Rhonda holds up the lighter!

               Over on the outcrop, Burt shouts:

                                          BURT
                            What's wrong?  Use the bomb, for
                            Godsake!

               Val signals to Rhonda to throw the lighter.  She nods.  But
               just before she does, A HUMP STARTS RISING DIRECTLY UNDER
               HER!  She fights to keep her balance -- struggling to keep
               from taking that single step which will instantly tell the
               creatures where she is.

               But there's no hope.  The hump jerks higher.  Her boots slip
               down the gravelly side!  Instantly the creature twists toward
               her, its hungry mouth erupting out of the dirt.  She screams
               and dashes for Val and Earl.  They run to meet her.  The
               other creatures surface.  The trio is cut off from the rock
               outcrop!

               Val and Earl link up with Rhonda and they all run madly while
               Rhonda tries to light Val's bomb fuse.  But suddenly Val
               yanks the bomb away.

                                          VAL
                            No wait!  This way!

               He veers off in a new direction.  Startled Earl and Rhonda
               have no choice but to follow.  As they desperately try to
               catch up to Val:

                                          EARL
                                   (gasping)
                            What the hell are you doing?!!

                                          VAL
                            I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!

               Earl looks up ahead.  They're headed right for --


         169   EXT.  THE CLIFFS - DAY                                       169

               The massive cliffs.  Earl's eyes bug out.  In seconds they'll
               be right at the brink with nowhere to run.

                                          EARL
                            This better be one great plan!

               As they skid to a stop at the very brink, Val breaks off the
               bomb fuse, leaving only one inch of it.  He whirls to check
               the progress of the advancing creatures.

                                          VAL
                            Get ready!

               He holds the bomb out to Rhonda.  She instantly tries to
               light it.  He grabs her wrist so hard it hurts.

                                          EARL
                            Light it, man!  LIGHT IT!!

                                          VAL
                            Not yet, not yet...

               The charging creatures are almost underfoot.  Finally Val
               pulls Rhonda's hand over to light the fuse.  Instantly he
               hurls the bomb as far as he can, behind the creatures.

                                          EARL
                            Too far!  You threw it behind them!

               The ground opens under their feet!  Tentacles snake toward
               Val and Earl.  A horrid mouth clamps onto Rhonda's boot.  She
               screams as it starts to pull her down.

               WHOOOM!!  The bomb explodes!  The creatures shriek in pain,
               instantly releasing their prey and racing away from the
               painful shock wave in the only direction they can --


         170   EXT.  CLIFFS - WIDE LOW ANGLE - DAY                          170

               Right out through the face of the cliffs!!  The huge,
               shrieking creatures seem to hang in mid-air for a moment,
               their grotesque bodies undulating in pain.  And then they
               fall!  And fall and fall -- a thousand feet!


         171   EXT.  BOTTOM OF CLIFFS - DAY                                 171

               The creatures land on massive jagged rocks, exploding like
               immense, horrid watermelons.  Multi-colored gore festoons the
               whole cliff face.

               TILT UP to see three tiny figures standing at the top of the
               cliff.


         172   EXT.  CLIFFS - DAY                                           172

               Val peers down at the distant creatures for a long time.  Then
               he notices Earl and Rhonda are staring at him.  Where the hell
               did he get an idea like that?  After a moment:

                                          VAL
                            Well, it just suddenly hit me, you
                            know?  Stampede?

               They turn and head back toward the others.  They laugh as
               they realize how stealthily they are walking.  Val starts
               taking big, exaggerated stomping steps.  Rhonda and Earl
               follow suit.  The trio goes off arm in arm, stomping merrily.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:


         173   EXT.  PERFECTION - MAIN STREET - DAY                         173

               Val and Earl roll two scavenged truck wheels down the street
               toward their own truck; which is up on jacks, two wheels
               missing.

               Mindy races past excitedly.

                                          MINDY
                            Look!

               A highway maintenance truck is rolling into town followed by
               a police car.  The townsfolk happily swarm around the
               MAINTENANCE MEN and POLICE OFFICER who gape at the destroyed
               town.

               Val and Earl eagerly start bolting on one of their new wheels.

                                          EARL
                            Road's in!

                                          VAL
                            Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit
                            Bixby we start making phone calls.
                            We could make some real money off
                            this whole thing, get in People
                            magazine...

                                          EARL
                            People?  Hell, National Geographic.

                                          VAL
                            Sell the movie rights.  We're going
                            straight from blue-collar to white
                            -collar.

                                          EARL
                            Yeah...but no ties.

                                          VAL
                            No ties.

               Rhonda pulls up in her truck, leans out and snaps their
               picture with a top-of-the-line Nikon.

                                          RHONDA
                            Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his
                            camera.

                                          EARL
                            Howdy, Rhonda.

                                          RHONDA
                            You're really leaving, huh?

                                          EARL
                            You bet.  You gonna be staying up
                            here?

                                          RHONDA
                            Well, yeah!  There's going to be
                            major research up here.  First
                            thing is to get some pictures of
                            that one we dug up.

               An awkward pause.  Finally she extends her hand to them.  Val
               just gives it a quick shake.

                                          RHONDA (cont'd)
                            Uh...well, maybe I'll see you two
                            sometime...
                                   (to Val)
                            And thanks for everything, you
                            know, saving my life and stuff.

                                          VAL
                                   (awkwardly)
                            Well...you're welcome.

               She gazes at him, just a hint of something in her eyes.  Earl
               springs to attention.  Is the boy blind?  Then Rhonda snaps
               out of it.

                                          RHONDA
                            Well...see ya.

               They nod.  She drives off.  Earl stares at Val who starts
               putting the second wheel on the truck.

                                          EARL
                            Christ, Val, maybe she's not your
                            type, but you could, at least, be
                            civil.

                                          VAL
                            Civil?  I'm civil.

                                          EARL
                            You're not civil, you're glum.  We
                            got the world by the tail with a
                            downhill pull and all of a sudden
                            you go glum on me.

               Earl freezes as a bell goes off in his head.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            Oh my God.  She got to you.  You do
                            like her!

                                          VAL
                            Somebody paying you to do this?

                                          EARL
                            She just practically asked you for
                            a date.  What the hell is wrong?!

               Val glares at Earl for a moment.

                                          VAL
                            Earl, get real.  What does she need
                            with a guy like me?

               Earl is dumbfounded.

                                          EARL
                            What was that?  All this time she's
                            not good enough for you.  Now,
                            suddenly, you're not good enough for
                            her?  God, my work is never done.
                            You don't decide is you're
                            worthless, she does.  But you gotta
                            give her a chance!

               Val lowers the jack letting the truck down.

                                          VAL
                            Earl, I'm not gonna make a fool of
                            myself!  You got that covered.

               Earl stands there fuming, mind racing.  A last ditch idea
               hits home -- we see a devilish glint in his eye.

                                          EARL
                            Fine, make the mistakes I did.
                            I think I'll just be playing this
                            hand myself.

                                          VAL
                            What?

                                          EARL
                            She likes both of us.  We both
                            helped her out.

                                          VAL
                            You are so full of shit...

                                          EARL
                            Oh yeah?  Think about this:  She
                            ain't as narrow-minded as you.
                            I'll lay odds she's looking for
                            character in a man.  For my part,
                            I'd be proud to have her.  I'd
                            goddamn worship her.

               Earl hops into the truck.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            I'm going out there right now, help
                            her take those pictures...set up her
                            seismo-jiggers.  Whatever she
                            wants.  Who the hell knows what'll
                            happen?

               Earl starts to drive off.  Val springs into the passenger
               seat.  Through the truck's rear window we see Val raise his
               hand in The Challenge.  They do a round of scissors-rock-
               paper -- but it's a tie.  They go again.  Another tie.  They
               keep playing and tying as they drive off into the distance
               and we --

                                                                   FADE OUT

          A HUEY COBRA in slow motion, crests an impossibly
          beautiful jungle ridge, flying low and straight at us.

          INSIDE THE COBRA
          A GUNNER sprays fire down at unseen anti-aircraft. All
          that can be see on the ground are whizzing TRACERS flying
          up at the chopper.

          

          

          

          
          "Tropic Thunder 4.
          The chopper skims the treetops heading toward a hot LZ...

          EXT.,, HOT LZ -- DAY

          As the Cobra comes in hard, about TWENTY INFANTRYMEN are
          emerging from the tree-line, in a chaotic fire fight with
          twice as many VC SOLDIERS.
          As the. chopper tries to land, the gunner tosses a couple
          of grenades behind the Americans, sending about ten VC
          flying. But the bulk of the platoon is getting GUNNED
          DOWN by the enemy.
          A. heavy set grunt, FATS, looking like he is in great
          pain, is'running full speed for the chopper, taking fire
          from all over.
          Fats looks a 'lot like JEFF PORTNOY, star of ."Doody For
          Dinner".
          BROOKLYN, an.18 year-old cherry from Brooklyn, is also on
          the move, towards the.chopper...Clutching his thick black
          glasses, and a. map, and triangulating coordinates, he' is
          frantically trying to call in an air strike on his radio
          backpack. A GRENADE EXPLODES ten feet away knocking him
          on his ass.
          He gets up, shaken, just in time to be BAYONETED. through
          the stomach by a VC SOLDIER...
          The VC soldier turns around just in time to be machine-
          gunned down-5y MOTOWN who has all sorts of stomizd
          shit" on his fatigues, an ace of spades in his helmet,
          along with some graffiti scrawl that reads "and God
          spoke" including cut-off sleeves that reveal his
          impressive pipes. He, is a 'bad muthaf.ucka.

          MOTOWN
          That's for Brooklyn, Muthafucka!
          Underneath the hovering chopper, OSIRIS,a black, buffed
          out Rambo-looking Sergeant, is letting loose his M-16
          with abandon, yelling at the pilot to get the bird lower.
          It does.
          Fats grabs. the mortally wounded Brooklyn and slings him
          over his shoulder, Brooklyn's shirt is blown open
          revealing his entrails...in shock, he clutches his liver
          in his right hand, and is trying futilely to put it back
          in his body...

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 5.
          FATS heaves Brooklyn onto the floor of the still-airborne
          chopper just as it gets low enough, and returns to
          firing. He unleashes a hailstorm of lead at the
          approaching VC...

          OSIRIS

          FATS! GET YOUR ASS ON THIS CHOPPER NOW!

          LET'S MOVE!

          FATS ignores him and continueb firing. MOTOWN comes
          running up to the chopper...

          Osiris turns on Motown, pulling his .45 in the midst of
           the mayhem. He pushes it up into Motown's neck.

          OSIRIS

          FOUR LEAF IS DEAD MEAT, SOLDIER! AND YOU

          GOT ZERO 0' HUNDRED HOURS TO GET YOUR ASS

          Osiris, standing on the skid, motions for the chopper
          pilot to take off.

          .We PUSH IN ON BROOKLYN dramatically as he raises his
          head. Looking off to the tree line, he points a crooked
          finger...

          BROOKLYN
          It's him. It's Four Leaf...
          Everyone turns to-see...
          FOUR LEAF, who looks a lot like CHRIS MICHAEL SPEEDMAN
          from the "Scorcher" trailer, . burst through the treeline,
          half limping, half crawling heroically through the
          massive firefight in SLOW MOTION.
          He is being chased.by about-FIFTY _VIET...CONG SOLDIERS...
          Everyone on board seems mesmerized. Osiris sees it, and
          can't believe his eyes... nevertheless, he screams to the
          pilot. I

          OSIRIS

          GO! GO!
          Fats, still on the ground, in defiance of Osiris, grabs
          the chopper's runner, and in a superhuman show of
          strength, OR IS IT WEIGHT, holds it with-all-his might,
          preventing it from flying away.
          The pilot struggles with the controls, as Fats continues
          his barrage of bullets with his machine gun arm,
          providing weak cover for Four Leaf.
          The chopper is now gaining momentum, and pulls Fats about
          ten feet-off-the ground. He is, about to lose his battle
          with the helicopter.
          Four Leaf, riddled with bullets, and delirious, is
          fighting a losing battle to gain ground... He doesn't
          even have a gun...

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 7.
          Osiris looks at the dejected faces of his men, then at
          Fats... a flash of anger and compassion comes over his
          face.. .
          FOUR"LEAF, Christ-like and arms extended, sinks to his
          knees, his body now absorbing unbelievable amounts of
          lead...

          OSIRIS

          I HOPE YOU FAGGOTS LIKE HAMBURGER BECAUSE

          THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I'M GONNA BE

          BRINGING BACK TO THIS BIRD.. .COVER ME!
          Weak smiles flicker across the face of the men as they do
          just that... unleashing lead all around Osiris as he jumps
          out of the chopper like an Apache warrior.
          Fats drops off the runner of the chopper, shooting his
          machine gun in cool SLO MO.
          Screaming a war cry, Osiris makes a beeline for Four
          Leaf. Dancing between the raindrops, he dodges tracer
          fire ...
          Osiris finally makes it and kneels beside Four Leaf,
          cradling his head. Four Leaf's eyes are glassy, and his
          body and arms are ripped open all over like a rag doll.

          FOUR LEAF
          Get outta here. I'm worm food, man, you
          dig?

          OSIRIS
          (beginning to cry)
          What, and give up all that California
          pussy you been talking about? Shiiit.
          Someone's gotta show me around L.A...

          FOUR LEAF
          (cracking a bloody smile)
          Shit. . .the only way you're gonna get a
          piece of LA pussy if is you go out to the
          graveyard and dig some up...
          Osiris looks down at Four Leaf's now missing arms...

          OSIRIS
          Well ...y...you better come along and
          bring the shovel...
          He starts to choke up.

          against another man... 'Stead of usin'

          Four Leaf screws.up.his .face and begins to cry--except
          that he can't. He tries again... and can't.. Hescrews

          shooting this war scene with about 50 CREW MEMBERS
          watching, surrounded by millions of dollars worth of film
          equipment.
          Four Leaf, actually the superstar. playing him, Speedman,
          is getting increasingly self-conscious, becoming more and.
          more aware of the-crew waiting for him to cry.
          The actor playing Osiris, KIRK LAZARUS, is also getting
          uncomfortable holding Speedman's not-crying head.

          The person perhaps most upset about it all is the skinny'
          young British director, DAMIEN DORFMAN. Coiled at the
          monitor and covered in bug bites and sunblock, wet towels
          around his neck, and clearly not made for jungle
          life.. .he' mouths the words "you are my brothers..'." as
          if trying to will the tears from Speedman's dry eyes.

          I'm sorry, can we cut, Damien?
          Damien grips his headphones in confusion, looking around
          to his cadre of assistants and ADs...
          The chopper continues to hover, soldiers continue to
          fight, except a few are starting to wonder what's going
          on.

          Now the extras have stopped fighting -- except for a few
          way far back.

          think they put w ay too much blood in my

          actor listening to the director.

          I'm sorry.. I can't do it, Dorff.
          Damien runs up to Speedman. They are the center of

          attempt to change gears with a comedy...

          Speedman'and Martin Lawrence, both with guns, are holding
          up a bank -- Speedman in drag. They yell at each other
          in that uptight-white-guy/loose-cannon-black-guy action
          comedy style.

          ."Simple Jack", the story-of a mentally
          impaired farm hand who can "talk" to
          animals was a box office disaster that
          many critics called one of the worst

          But now, the question is can Speedman "mu-
          mu-make" audiences happy in the true life
          story of war hero Four Leaf Tayback in
          "Tropic Thunder". And,' possibly a shot â 1. -4416

          Julie sits with Speedman. With them is the real FOUR
          LEAF, a stoic, grizzled man of few words.

          SPEEDMAN
          (very serious)
          All I want is to make the real Four Leaf
          here proud. It's his story, he lived it
          and wrote it in his book. That's why
          we're here. But really, I mean, how cah
          we begin to understand what he-- what you
          --went through?
          Four Leaf fixes his stoic, steely gaze on the horizon for
          a beat. He lifts his hands up, and we see he has only
          two HOOKS.
          Speedman studies him closely, aping his gestures, trying
          to "get inside" him as much as possible.

          FOUR LEAF

          (MYSTICAL)
          When I lost these...

          It was as if I saw through these for the
          first time..'.

          And it was only then that I really began
          to use these...

          SPEEDMAN
          That's great. He's like a... Buddha or
          something. Maybe I should rub his belly
          for luck!
          He laughs, but quickly realizes Four Leaf doesn't find it
          funny.

          Hey, Dorf. Just wanted to call and throw
          a little pep talk your way. I know today
          was rough, and you're probably mad at
          yourself for not getting the shots, but
          that's the way these movies go. We all

          The credibility factor that the pandas
          give you is priceless, and strangely, if'
          you see this picture, what really strikes
          me is the credibility that you give them.
          I've been getting psychotic feedback all
          day. Hey did you get the basket I sent?

          in some experimental Malaysian dipping
          sauce so he can actually be black, of
          course he's gonna get buzz. Listen to
          what I am telling you. He is clinically
          mentally not right.

          SPEEDMAN
          Yeah but the way they talk about him. I
          mean, he played a retarded guy and won an
          Oscar, I play a retarded guy and don't
          even get a nomination. I don't know, I
          mean you said "Simple Jack" would be my

          said stay home be happy and you said "no,

          and I said "okay" and then I said "are

          down. He looks in a deep funk.
          Portnoy STAGE DIVES straight onto the lawn, landing with
          a thud in front of Damien.

          DAMIEN,
          Jeff. Jeff are you alright?.We.need to
          talk -- as.a cast, as a platoon, right
          now.

          PORTNOY
          (sick and drunk)
          Dorfie-- did you happenito see that grip
          withthe bandana?-The big guy?-I was
          supposed to meet him here. He has a-
          package of mine.
          Kevin Sandusky ("Brooklyn" from the movie) comes up to
          them, looking fresh faced and eager.

          SANDUSKY.
          Hey Mr. Dorfman. Jeff. You O.K? That was
          some hit you took today.

          PORTNOY

          (BEAT)
          Who are you?

          SANDUSKY
          I'm Kevin. Are you serious? Kevin
          Sandusky? I'm playing Brooklyn?

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 29.

          PORTNOY
          Oh yeah. Right. Hey, have you seen that
          grip with the bandana?

          SANDUSKY
          Uh, no. I think--
          But Portnoy is off already looking for his drug
          connection. They both watch him go.

          SANDUSKY
          Hey, Mr. Dorfman, I was hoping to find
          you. I know this is a party, but this
          afternoon after work I was breaking down
          my M-16, and I have to say, in the night
          watch scene, a minute and a half is a
          pretty short amount of time to assemble
          it.

          DAMIEN

          (TOUCHED)
          You actually care, don't you?

          SANDUSKY
          Oh, yeah. Of course. This is a huge
          opportunity. To be working with all these
          great actors, and you.

          DAMIEN
          You're the only one who auditioned.
          You're the only one who did the two week
          boot camp, Sandusky.

          SANDUSKY
          Yeah, I know. It was kind of weird.
          Wasn't the point that we were all
          supposed to bond?

          DAMIEN

          (BITTERLY)
          Yes, that was the point.
          Damien, grabs a drink from a passing tray, and downs it.
          We follow A WAITER as he passes Speedman with a tray of
          food.
          Speedman, ungracefully and with his hook hands, grabs a
          spring roll off the tray. He resumes talking to LAZARUS
          who is deeply uninterested.

           I
          r Tropic Thunder 30.

          SPEEDMAN
          I guess I just watched some retarded
          people. I mean, I spent a lot. of time.
          with them... watching them.. Watching all
          the retarded stuff they did.

          LAZARUS
          Huh, I always found mere observation a
          little rudimentary. Gotta dig deeper to
          mine the true emotional,paydirt. Diagram
          the source of the pain. Then live it.

          SPEEDMAN
          (trying. to keep up)
          Exactly! With Jack. I was, for the
          first time in-my life..
          (searches for the word)
          Retarded. I was retarded.in.the trailer,
          retarded at home., Brushing my. teeth
          retarded. In a `weird way I had to
          unlearn what it was to be... .NOT
          retarded.

          LAZARUS
          Yeah... but Simple Jack thought he was
          smart. Or, rather, didn't think he was
          retarded. So you can afford to play
          retarded', being a smart actor. Tricky
          tricky stuff. Hats off for going. there.
          Especially.knowing how the Academy is
          about that shit.
          Speedman is lost:

          SPEEDMAN
          About what?

          LAZARUS
          (with 'a chuckle)
          Are you serious? Everyone knows you
          don't ever go fully retarded!

          SPEEDMAN
          How do you mean?
          Lazarus sets his. drink down. School's in session.

          LAZARUS
          Check it out. Dustin Hoffman, Rain Man.
          Looked retarded. Acted retarded. NOT
          retarded. He could count toothpicks,
          cheat at cards. Autistic. Sure. NOT
          retarded. HANKS'. Forest Gump. Slow? Yes.

          LAZARUS (cont'd)
          Retarded? Maybe. Had braces on his legs,
          he charmed the pants bff Nixon, and won a
          ping-pong competition. Peter Sellers,
          "Being There", infantile? Yes.
          Retarded? No.
          He claps a hand on Speedman's shoulder.

          LAZARUS
          You went full retard, man. You never go 14
          full retard. Don't believe me? Ask Sean
          Penn, 2001, I am Sam. Went full retard.
          Went home empty handed.
          Speedman sees this for the truth it is. How could he be
          so stupid?

          LAZARUS
          (cruelly, driving it home)
          But hey, man! Who knows? Four Leaf could
          be your ticket to Oscar gold. I'd lose
          the hook hands though... cripples don't
          give the Academy wood either.

          SPEEDMAN

          (DAZED)
          Oh.
          Lazarus laughs and excuses himself by rattling his glass
          and heading for the bar. Speedman stands hurt, delicately
          holding the spring,roll in his hook.

          ON THE OTHER SIDE,OF THE ROOM
          Damien paces the party. He looks more miserable and high
          strung than ever. He discovers Redykulous, surrounded by
          his posse and a CAMERA CREW.

          DAMIEN
          Redykulous... I need to talk to you.

          REDYKULOUS
          What up, money.

          DAMIEN
          (in a hushed tone, aware of
          the cameras)
          We're having a cast meeting, right now
          We need to come together as a unit --
          The camera crew moves in for the close-up. . .making Damien
          uncomfortable ... Redykulous takes it in stride. Throughout
          the scene he is TEXT MESSAGING someone.

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 32.

          REDYKULOUS
          Uh-huh...
          Damien is made uncomfortable by the cameraman who has i
          started manually zooming in and out on him in a dutch
          style camera move...
          DAMIEN i
          Do you mind if we step away for a moment?

          REDYKULOUS
          From what?
          Damien tries to indicate the crew.

          DAMIEN
          (whispering even lower now)
          From the...uh...you know... .this area..

          REDYKUL:OUS
          Oh, I see...sure
          They take a few steps away from the bar... The entire
          camera crew follows.

          DAMIEN
          Oh. Hah! No, I mean away from the
          cameras.
           you understand?. Away from
          (indicating the crew)
          them...

          REDYKULOUS
          No.

          DAMIEN
          What?

          REDYKULOUS
          No. I can't do that. If Redykulous
          steps away from the cameras then my
          .people don't get to see the real
          Redykulous. The show is called "Utterly
          Redykulous".

          DAMIEN
          Well this is about work ...my show so to.
          .speak. Do you understand?

          REDYKULOUS
          I guess. But not really. Your show and
          my show are the same thing. This is gonna
          help your show, trust me.

          My show AND the soundtrack drops the same
          time "Tropic Thunder opens. So you get
          that crossover audience everybody wants
          on your opening weekend, which will
          dictate your revenue streams all the way
          through DVD release, pay per view,
          etcetera.
          Damien thinks this over for a second. It does sort of
           make sense. He then notices the chmera crew pushing in k I , 1 '144%
          for a close up He awkwardly tries to get away from
          them...

          DAMIEN
          Excuse me, everyone! If I could have
          your attention!
          Nothing. No one notices except Speedman. Damien grabs a
          couple bottles off the bar and BANGS them together.

          DAMIEN
          Sorry to break up the party, but I just
          wanted to call your attention to a cast
          meeting tonight! Big meeting! Future of
          the film depends on it!

          (UNRAVELING)
          Not to mention my entire bloody life!
          Damien in a final cry of frustration, SMASHES a bottle on
          the bar. He succeeds only in cutting his hand.

          DAMIEN

          GODFUCKITI SHIT!
          Speedman comes up, placing a calming hook on Damien's
          shoulder. He steps to the fore.

          SPEEDMAN
          (slowly, deliberately)
          "When... we.'.. put... aside... our...
          differences... we see we're kind of the
          same."
          Within moments, the place settles completely.

          SPEEDMAN
          (Long beat...-then almost
          quietly.)
          "When we put aside our differences, we
          see we're kind of the same. Let's be
          friends, I know we will do great things

          That's a quote from my children's book,
          "The Boy Everybody-Was Jealous Of." I
          know it's just a book for. kids, but I
          think it applies to.making a movie as
          well. 'Course... I know a lot of the
          reason things are maybe messed up is ME.
          The guys look at each other -- maybe he's not so bad.

          SPEEDMAN
          I was looking-at it all backwards. You
          guys are lost. You heed.me to.lead you,
          to help you gel, and straighten.up --
          like a PLATOON!

          (drunk out of his mind)
          Hey,. Speedman! That bullshit pep'talk
          made me.H-h-h-h-h-happy!
          The entire party cuts.up.in loud hysterics. Speedman
          looks hurt. The DJ puts on-a Redykulous track really
          loud, and the, place gets even crazier.

          EXT. BEACH - LATER

          Damien, drunk, walks along, illuminated by the light of
          the moon. He holds' a bottle of wine, which.he chugs..In
          the distance, the party rages.

          When a herd loses its way, the shepherd
          must kill the bull that leads them
          astray..
          Damien turns around., startled. FOUR LEAF is standing
          eerily in the bushes by the sand.

          FOUR LEAF
          You don't know which way is up, do you
          private`? You couldn't find a dixie
          coonskin with an Ohio hooker holding your
          prick. and showin' you the way...
          Damien doesn't know what the fuck that meant.
          Four Leaf moves to him, staring deep into his eyes.
          Damien's eyes widen in fear.

          A raindrop cannot carve a valley. An ant
          cannot defeat a buffalo. But a tempest
          can cleave that mountain to make the
          valley, and an army of ants can fell the
          mighty buffalo.

          DAMIEN
          (seeing the wisdom of this)
          Yes...

          FOUR LEAF
          If the lion, although king of the jungle,
          is thrown into the sea, he will

          (long pause)

          DO YOU!?
          He lunges at Damien and grabs him by the collar with both
          hooks. '

          DAMIEN
          (near tears now)
          I want to!!! But not really!!

          guys. But the shit is what made us a
          unit. A whole. You must put them in the

          SHIT.
          He releases Damien and takes a large draw on his
          cigarette...

          FOUR LEAF
          There's a place. About a hundred clicks
          from here, as the crow flies. Deep in the
          jungle. No trailers, no port-a-potties.
          Nothing but triple canopy jungle and
          cockroaches the size of melons.
          Damien seems intrigued yet a little freaked out by his
          weirdness.

          Rig up your documentary cameras'in that
          jungle, give me and Cody a few of those
          smoke bombs and some charges and we could
          light up the jungle so those lily-dick
          actors would think they were in the
          middle of. Hamburger Hill. You.get them
          thinking they're getting shot at, and
          you'll have your movie.
          Suddenly, Four Leaf slaps his neck with his hook as
          though he has been bitten. He holds out a small squished
          mosquito' between the claws of his prosthesis.

          FOUR LEAF
          You must put them.under your thumb the
          way this. bug is under mine... .under YOUR
          control.

          DAMIEN
          I see ...yes ...They would 'be under my
          total control... finally. I could shoot
          the whole movie there. Gritty. Dirty.
          Away from their pampered pussy posses and
          helpers...

          FOUR LEAF
          Yes... yes...

          DAMIEN
          Put them in the real shit. Film them
          with real fear in their eyes. REAL FEAR!

          .REAL EMOTION! YES! YES, FOUR LEAF, FUCK

          YES!!
          Damien and Four Leaf share a crazed look. COOL MUSIC UP
          as WE PUSH IN and...

          CUT TO:

          EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

          A CHOPPER skimming the treetops, illuminated by a lonely
          moon...

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 37.

          IN THE CHOPPER
          Cody is piloting. Damien and Four Leaf are in the back
          sitting, across from Speedman, Portnoy, Redyk and Lazarus
          and Sandusky.
          We move across the faces of the actors, all in
          brainbuckets, who all look confusted and unhappy, except
          for Sandusky who seems excited.
          Speedman clutches the camouflaged gift bag from his agent
          Rick Peck.

          PORTNOY

          (FINALLY)
          So, uh, any idea how long we'll be gone?
          Because I left most of my... vitamins
          back at the hotel.
          The other actors chime in with similar concerns,
          regarding sleeping arrangements, make up facilities,
          etc... '

          FOUR LEAF
          Save your breath, maggots!
          They all shrink back. Four Leaf's fierce posture is
          undercut as the helicopter lurches, sending Damien
          sprawling onto hire.

          DAMIEN
          That'sâ¢right. Maggots.

          EXT. JUNGLE - DAWN

          The chopper lands in a small clearing as the sun rises
          behind a mountain.

          IN THE CHOPPER
          Damien and Four Leaf, in DI mode, hustle the "grunts" off
          the chopper.

          DAMIEN

          GO!!!
          Apparently they are not moving fast enough -- Four Leaf
          and Damien shove the guys out of the chopper onto the
          ground.

          FOUR LEAF

          MOVE! MOVE! MOVE!
          The group, scared shitless, start falling out of the
          doors of the chopper, more like a bunch of oysters than a
          crack platoon.
          Four leaf jumps on the skid of thy chopper and motions to
          Cody, who lifts off. It kicksï¿½up a violent backwash, 0, Iq y
          forcing the guys to duck. and cover.

          FOUR LEAF
          See you in hell!
          As the noise of the helicopter fades, the group starts.
          trying to orient itself in their new surroundings.' The
          Jungle. Black, dense, unforgiving.
          All around them can be seen the remnants of a war that
          has been over for thirty years. A grave marker,. half of
          an old rusted outâ¢'downed chopper.
          All are absorbing the spookiness, except Portnoy who
          seems very upset.

          PORTNOY
          This is bullshit!
          Damien marches over to him, and SLAPS HIM REPEATEDLY in
          the face.

          PORTNOY I
          (clutching his cheeks)

          OWW! FUCKIN' JESUS, DUDE!

          YOU'RE SITTING ON A NEST OF HOSTILE V.C.

          ENEMY. CONGRATULATIONS FATS. YOU JUST GOT

          US ALL KILLED! ANYBODY ELSE CARE TO GIVE

          AWAY OUR POSITION TO CHARLIE!!
          Silence.

          DAMIEN

          CELL PHONES!
          Everyone hands over their phones.
          Speedman, however, turns away from the group, getting his.
          satellite phone out of the gift bag. He surreptitiously
          stows it down the front of his pants.

          Damien dumps them in a pile and finds a large boulder. HE
          smashes the phones with a draatic flair. The guys GROAN.
          Damien turns on them with a crazy gleam in his eye.

          DAMIEN
          Okay, girls... now that I have your
          attention, I will tell you fuckfaces what
          we're doing here. You are no longer
          actors in a movie. You,are grunts in a
          war. These men around you are your
          brothers.
          The guys look at each other, unhappy.

          DAMIEN
          Congratulations. You've just landed in
          "the shit". Your objective is to head
          north and liberate the village at D'ang
          Kwook Hill, at which point "Four Leaf"
          gets himself captured, at which point you
          rescue him, at which point we will
          chopper you home. We will also be
          rigging this entire valley of death with
          hidden cameras so that every glorious
          moment gets on film. And believe me it
          WILL be glorious. If it looks real,
          chances are good it probably is. You
          wanted to be actors? You wanted to
          occupy the skin of another human being?
          Get ready to occupy the skin of a
          terrified U.S. Infantry grunt, surrounded
          by death, crawling up Satan's arsehole.
          There's going to be enemy fire. Booby
          traps. Your own personal little slice of
          the 'Nam.
          The group shares a look -- "What's going on?"
          He pulls out a laminated packet.

          DAMIEN
          (to Spe?dman)
          "Four Leaf", since you're the Captain
          here, here's the scene list and the map.
          (he throws them at him)
          Think you can handle it? From now on,
          Whatever we get on film is our movie,
          period.
          Damien pulls out a walkie-talkie.

          It will be used only in an emergency or
          to replenish our supplies if absolutely
          necessary. This is NOT a cell phone.
          This radio goes'to the chopper, and the

          The group stands absolutely stock still for several long

          SPEEDMAN
          Whoa.

          EXT. JUNGLE. -- A HALF MILE AWAY

          A group of about SIX ASIAN GUERILLA FIGHTERS, well armed
          and scary looking,,. notice the sound of the explosion.
          They begin talking very seriously in a foreign language.
          One of them grabs a radio:

          GUERILLAS

          (SUBTITLES)
          < We have heard an explosion, in the
          northern sector.>

          A UNKNOWN VOICE
          (crackling over walkie
          talkie),
          .
          They lock and load, heading towards the actors...

          EXT. JUNGLE -- A.HILLTOP CLEARING

          Four Leaf scans the horizon while. Cody sets up high-tech
          equipment, including monitors and cameras and detonation
          devices.

          

          

          

          

          I
          Tropic Thunder 41.

          CODY
          So, I'm thinkin' as soon as Damien gives
          us the go ahead, we'ï¿½ust their cherry
          with a few airbursts, then alpha-alpha
          till they come running right at, us, then
          a good of fashioned firefight,
          maintaining our distance.
          Four Leaf ignores him, instead looking around the jungle,
          looking almost lost.

          CODY
          I been meaning to tell ya the whole
          shoot. I'm probably one-a your biggest
          fans. Your book was kinda my "Catcher in
          the Rye". It inspired me to become a gyro
          man.
          Four Leaf gives Cody nothing -- except his usual stoic
          stare.

          CODY
          I'm actually sort of a war nut. I mean I
          never was in the service, but for me
          blowing shit up in a war films is sort of
          my way of paying tribute to the real
          deal. And you sir, are the real deal.
          Nothing.

          CODY
          Hey, I was wonderin' what kind of sidearm
          you carry? Looks to me like a--

          FOUR LEAF
          (very scary)
          I don't know what it's called. I just
          know the sound it makes when it takes a
          man's life.
          Cody, a little spooked, picks up his radio.

          CODY
          Ok, we're ready to rock and roll.
          (to walkie-talkie)
          Damien, come in. Cameras are up,
          ordinance are up. Ready to kick the tires
          and light the fires on your say so.

          EXT. JUNGLE - THE ACTORS

          WE are close on the seemingly broken.walkie talkie,.which
          has heard none of this. We PULL BACK to reveal the guys,
          staring at Damien's corpse in total shock. All except
          Speedman, who looks on with a smirk.

          PORTNOY
          I think he's like... dead.

          SPEEDMAN:
          (with a chuckle)
          Nice, very nice, Dorf. . .Very nice,
          wherever you're hiding!

          REDYKULOUS
          I don't think he's hiding.. I think he
          just died!
          Sandusky leans down towards the off screen corpse.
          pulls a wrist into frame.

          SANDUSKY
          He doesn't. have a pulse ...or a head.
          He then grabs a bent and rusty.piece of metal.

          SANDUSKY
          Must've been one of those Claymore mines.
          This old Jungle must.be full of them.,

          REDYKUZOUS
          You bet your ass it is. That's why a
          percentage of my Pymp Sweat Profits are
          helpin' solve the problem!
          Damien's corpse emits a disturbing death rattle.
          Speedman busts up laughing. They turn to him -- what the
          hell?
          Speedman throws an-arm.around Sandusky, -like an indulgent
          older brother.

          SPEEDMAN
          C'mon! Don't you get it? This is what
          .Dorf was talking about -- our slice of
          the Nam! He's trying to get in our
          heads!

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 43.

          GUERRILLAS P.O.V -- FROM THE SURROUNDING JUNGLE
          They are right behind the treeline, watching the guys
          from about thirty feet.

          SPEEDMAN
          That whole "life and death" speech in the
          chopper? He's meshing 'with us! What do
          you think all that "playing God" was
          about?
          The guys breathe a huge collective sigh of relief --
          except Lazarus.

          LAZARUS
          Are you nuts, shithead? The dude is
          dead!!
          Sandusky looks unsure. He doesn't want to take sides.

          SPEEDMAN
          Kirk. I know you're the big fancy actor
          here, but, no offense, I've done a lot
          mote effects driven event films, and I
          think I can spot a prop body.

          ON THE GUERRILLAS
          The LEAD guerilla signals for all his guys to hold their
          fire and pick their targets...

          ON THE ACTORS
          Suddenly, The walkie-talkie lying on Damien's body
          crackles to life:

          CODY (ON WALKIE)
          -- I repeat, we are now go for mission!

          DAMIE--
          The walkie crackles unintelligibly. Speedman picks it up,
          showing it to the guys. See?

          SPEEDMAN

          (SMIRKING)
          Alright, can we start the scene now? Or
          do you need a formal invitation?!
          (checking the list)

          Tropic Thunder 44.
          Speedman closes his eyes, taking a second to get into
          character. He opens them, and grabs. his gun and creeps
          towards the bushes, stealthily..

          SPEEDMAN
          (as Four Leaf)
          I got a baaaad feeling on this one, Fats.
          The group remains motionless., Speedman gives Portnoy a ,M in MAIM
          "c'mon!" type look. Portnoy doesn't know what he means...

          SPEEDMAN
          I said, I got a baaad feeling on this
          one, Brooklyn...
          Oh! He's acting!
          Sandusky hesitantly takes the cue, and starts walking.
          stealthily around.with him, on high.alert.for Charlie.
          Swinging his gun unpredictably.

          ON THE GUERILLAS
          They are a mere ten or fifteen feet from Sandusky on the
          other side of the. trees... they back off as. he waves his
          gun...

          Me too, cap'n.

          (BEAT)
          Hey, cap?: If.I told you something,
          something kinda personal, you wouldn't
          think I was crazy, right?

          SPEEDMAN
          Naw, man. I know you ain't crazy
          Brooklyn...

          SANDUSKY
          Well,. if I told you that I, I never
          actually, well, been with a girl...you
          wouldn't, like, think I was, like, queer
          .or nothin'... would you.?

          SPEEDMAN
          .Naw, man... I wouldn't think you was a
          queer.

          Redykulous shrugs and joins in, too:

          REDYKULOUS
          (acting really "black guy"

          SCARED)
          Sh...sh...shit ...When I get back to the
          world, I'm gonna find me the finest piece
          of Detroit nubian mugambo, and fuck it
          till I broke its back.

          PORTNOY
          The last "mugambo" you ever tasted was in
          your momma's soup bowl. I wouldn't mind
          slurpin' on a little of that --

          SPEEDMAN
          That's enough outta you Fats. Don't you
          worry, Brooklyn. You gotta lotta days a
          fucking ahead of you and I for one ain't
          gonna let Charlie...
          Lazarus can't handle it anymore.

          LAZARUS
          What the FUCK is wrong with you people?!
          Speedman shoots him a look then takes a few steps back.
          He addresses the treeline.

          SPEEDMAN
          Sorry Damien! Back to one... action!
          (he gets back in character)
          Don't you worry, Brooklyn, You gotta

          LOTTA--

          LAZARUS
          Yo, asshole! Mothafucka just DIED!
          Speedman sighs, annoyed.

          SPEEDMAN
          How many more takes you wanna wreck? Some
          of us are taking this seriously.
          Lazarus looks likes he wants to explode. But instead he
          becomes eerily calm. He begins an impressive
          transformation -- Everything except for his skin color
          returns to his real identity, a pompous Irish prick.

          LAZARUS
          (Heavy Irish)

          movie, ya gobshite!

          must go on, but this is feckin' madness.

          PORTNOY
          (re: Lazarus transformation) i
          Wow. That was really cool.

          THE GUERILLAS
          Are watching this, poised to attack.

          BACK ON THE ACTORS
          Speedman and Lazarus argue, more heated now.

          SPEEDMAN
          Excuse me Kirk, I think you dropped
          something.
          He mimes picking something , off, the ground.

          SPEEDMAN
          It's called your character. Don't worry,
          I won't tell the Academy!
          Suddenly: GUNFIRE FROM EVERYWHERE! The Guerrillas have
          seized the moment.
          The actors all immediately hit the dirt, except for
          Speedman,.who just looks annoyed and blase as dirt and
          debris kicks up all around him.

          SPEEDMAN
          You happy now? We're out of position for
          the effect! Am I the only one who read
          .the script?! This is the ambush!
          A tree aboveSpeedman gets hit, explodes, sprays chunks
          of wood and shrapnel everywhere.

          SANDUSKY
          I think they're really shooting at us!

          SPEEDMAN
          What are you guys worried about? These
          guys are pros. The unions would tear
          them a new ass-if any of us got hurt.
          The actors stay down, looking scared.

          SPEEDMAN
          Come on, you guys! Let's use this!

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 47.
          No one follows Speedman's lead., Fine, he'll go it alone.
          Speedman begins shooting at the guerillas alone, and
          doing a very good job of it, going through an assortment
          of absurd action style maneuvers throughout.
          Redykulous looks around, and then decides to get up and
          join him. Sandusky and Portnoy look at each other -- what
          the heck -- and follow. They all fire at the unseen
          enemy, letting out very convincing WAR CRIES.

          ON THE GUERRILLAS
          Not knowing it's only blanks, and awed by the power of
          the actors' automatic weapons, and the intensity of their
          screams, they drop back...

          GUERILLA LEADER
          
          The guerillas hastily go through their packs hooking up
          RPGs...

          EXT. JUNGLE - HILLTOP CLEARING

          Four Leaf looks out into the jungle below, he can hear
          the firefight, but, Cody can't.

          FOUR LEAF
          Hear that?
          Cody is preoccupied with the radio and the explosives.

          CODY
          What? I still can't get Damien on the
          radio. I bet he forgot how to use the
          Walkie again. What do you say we get a
          little... pro-active?
          Cody, very excited, grabs a plunger.

          BACK ON THE ACTORS
          Still fighting, oblivious that the guerillas are about to
          blow them to kingdom come with RPGs.
          But before the guerillas have a chance--

          

          

          

          

          I

          ON CODY
          He pushes down the plunger...

          ON THE GUERILLAS

          BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!!
          Dirt flies, the guerillas don't know what the hell is
          going on =- except that someone is suddenly bombing the
          shit out of them. They beat a hasty retreat.

          EXT. JUNGLE HILLTOP CLEARING

          Cody and Four Leaf watch Cody's handiwork with
          binoculars. A smoke cloud slowly rises from the jungle.

          CODY
          Right on!! I bet Damien heard that!.
          Cody turns to Four Leaf, and finds himself staring
          straight at 10 GUERILLA FIGHTERS with their submachine
          guns pointed straight at them.

          CODY
          Oh shit.

          FOUR LEAF
          Oh yeah.
          And with that Cody and Four Leaf are.RIFLE BUTTED out of
          consciousness...

          EXT. JUNGLE -- THE ACTORS

          Speedman motions for everyone to "cease fire".

          the trailer 'right there!

          REDYKULOUS
          That was some sick shit! I wasn't even
          thinking bout the camera!
          The guys' adrenaline is flowing, they do high fives all
          around. Lazarus is not happy. He looks off into the
          jungle, sensing that someone was out there.

          So what do we do now?
          Speedman pulls out the map, frowns at it.

          SPEEDMAN
          Damien said to head north. I'm guessing
          they've got more of these "battles" and
          Viet Congs rigged for uls on the way.
          (into it)
          Alright, let's hump-our shit to D'ang
          Kwook! Let's didi double time! We got a
          lot of clicks to cover!
          Speedman heads off into a particularly dense section of
          jungle. After a beat, he reappears, looking a little
          lost.

          SANDUSKY
          Uh...Sir, isn't it that way?
          Kevin points in the other direction. Speedman glances
          down at the map, which he rotates around, right side up
          now.

          SPEEDMAN
          Oh yeah. Thanks, uh...

          SANDUSKY

          Kevin. Kevin Sandusky.

          SPEEDMAN
          Right. Okay, To D'ang Kwook! Lets do-it-
          to-it!
          Everyone follows Speedman. Lazarus, very reluctantly,
          brings up the rear, still looking off into the jungle. A

          EXT. FLAMING DRAGON COMPOUND - ESTABLISHING

          It is a large, secret heroin processing facility,
          surrounded by barbed wire fencing. It is in a clearing
          in the jungle, by a small river.
          There's a GUARD TOWER overlooking a main gate, which
          leads into a big open courtyard area. The main structure
          is a low, concrete military-looking building.
          It's all populated with tough-looking, well-armed
          badasses.

          CODY AND FOUR LEAF, both hog-tied and unconscious, are
          marched through the courtyard, and into a building.

          INT. FLAMING DRAGON COMPOUND - COMMAND CENTER

          We are behind the back of the person who is in charge. In
          front of him, we see workers busily manufacturing tar
          heroin, in a sweatshop like atmosphere.
          A cadre of guerilla fighters domes in, sweaty and tired.
          The Lieutenant steps to the fore -- this is BYONG. He's
          badly shaken.

          EXT. BAMBOO FOREST -- DAY

          The actors are slogging along, through a tall thicket of
          bamboo. They look exhausted -- except for Speedman, who
          always manages to look like.a.movie star.

          PORTNOY
          So... we're just supposed to keep
          walking?

          SPEEDMAN
          We'll see some action soon enough. And
          try to stay in character. We're on
          camera..

          PORTNOY
          What do you mean "soon"?

          guess.

          PORTNOY
          When's that?

          SPEEDMAN
          I don't know. That's the whole point.
          Damien wants us tired and confused.

          REDYKULOUS
          Yeah, well I'm definitely qualifying for
          those objectives.
          Everyone chimes in -- they all need a break. Lazarus
          notices the mutinous vibe and smiles.

          SPEEDMAN
          Fine, fine. Okay, let's take a break,
          but be on the lookout for anything.
          Charlie doesn't care if you're on a break
          or not.
          Speedman plunks down and opens the map. He seems puzzled.
          Lazarus eyes him suspiciously. Sandusky walks off to take
          a leak. Lazarus then watches him go.
          Off to the side, Sandusky starts to pee. He hears
          something rustle next to him.

          LAZARUS (O.S.)
          Psst. Hey.
          Sandusky turns to see Lazarus peeing uncomfortably close
          to him.

          LAZARUS
          Speedman is watching. I don't have much
          time. I don't really need to piss. I
          need to talk to you. You went to the
          boot camp Sandusky, right? You can read
          that map?

          SANDUSKY
          Yeah...

          LAZARUS
          Good, good. Speedman is a tosser. That
          hoor's melt really thinks this is a
          movie. And he's got the lot of ya
          convinced.

          filming us?

          I

          LAZARUS
          Of course not! It's only a matter of
          time before he walks us into more mines
          or more of whoever the hell was shootin',
          at us. That muppet's going to get us all
          killed. I need to convince everyone.to
          turn around, but I .can't do it without
          the map. You're the only one who can
          read it. Can I count on you?

          SANDUSKY
          Well, yeah, I.guess. But

          LAZARUS
          Good man, Good man.
          Lazarus makesa big show of pretending he's done peeing,
          shaking, etc.., and heads back to the group.
          Speedman eyes Lazarus. What is he up to?
          Sandusky is just getting comfortable, begins to pee
          again. He hears another rustle. He turns.to see
          Speedman, right next to him.

          SPEEDMAN
          I'm gonna level with you, bro. I don't
          need to pee. I need to talk to you.
          Speedman surreptitiously takes out a can of Pymp Sweat
          and sticks the tip of his Bowie knife into it, to create
          a red pee.stream.

          SPEEDMAN
          Lazarus is insane. He's freaking out, and.
          he's gonna.ruin the whole movie for all
          of us. The men respect you, because you
          went to boot camp and rehearsal.
          (patting his shoulder)
          And you're pretty handy with that map. I
          need you on my side, Kyle.

          talk to some of the Dreamworks
          brass... there'll probably be a Teen
          Choice award in it for you. You have
          that potential.

          SANDUSKY
          Well, I --

          SPEEDMAN
          Good man. Good man.
          Speedman rejoins the group, gives Lazarus a cocky look.

          EXT. JUNGLE - ELSEWHERE - LATER

          The guys continue to trudge along a hugely overgrown
          path. Speedman machetes through the overgrowth.

          SPEEDMAN
          If we stay on this trajectory we should
          be reaching the village any minute now.
          At the end of the line, we hear a few groans emanating
          from Portnoy.

          of us...

          No... its just that I don't feel so hot...
          I left my medication at the hotel.

          (to himself, snickering)
          Yeah, I'd like to check out some of those
          "meds" for my own self.
          Lazarus moves up to Speedman.

          LAZARUS
          Look, ya eejit, I mean, if there was a
          village don't you think we would have hit
          it by now?

          SPEEDMAN
          Quit your carping, we're right where
          we're supposed to be!

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 54.
          WHUMP! All of a sudden Speedman disappears out of
          frame...
          We see he has fallen chest deep into the edge of a SLOW

          MOVING RIVER.

          LAZARUS
          .(laughing)
          Hey, Is there a feckin' river on that
          map?
          S.pee`dman refers to the'now sopping wet map.

          SPEEDMAN
          Yes! There is! Its just a little more'
          down to the... lefty-down part from the:
          village.
          (checking the scene list)
          Anyway,. this feels like the Sampan, Boat
          Raid at the end of the second act.

          LAZARUS
          I don't see a "Sampan" boat!

          SPEEDMAN
          Any second now one should come by.
          Alright men, into the water!
          Everyone'except Lazarus reluctantly gets into the water.
          They all hold their rifles above their heads.

          Lazarus grabs Sandusky.

          LAZARUS
          Sandusky agrees. with me. Don't you,
          Sandusky?
          Kevin is caught, not sure what to d

          No, yer an actor. Arid if memory serves,
          a pretty shite one.
          The actors react -- Damn! Oh Snap! Shit! Speedman steels'
          himself.

          SPEEDMAN
          THAT'S THE WAY OUT! That's our only
          chance!

          PORTNOY
          Yeah, but maybe we should stay here until
          they send help! Or maybe try to get back
          to the hotel.

          SPEEDMAN
          Help from where! Need I remind you that
          Damien's orders were to --
          (right at Lazarus)
          --stay in character.

          Now, I already have an international box
          office presence, but for some of you, I'm
          guessing you might not want to screw this
          movie up!
          This actually seems to affect the actors. Lazarus can't
          believe it.

          SPEEDMAN
          .okay...C'mon, boys! This way. Let's go
          get those Viet Congs!
          Lazarus throws down his gun. He's had it.

          Jay-sus Fuck! It's Viet Cona! Not Viet
          Congs! Viet Cong, you plunker! And, hey,
          if you're so sure of yourself, why don't
          you let Kelvin have a look at the map?!
          Kevin doesn't know what to do -- he doesn't want to get
          in the middle of this. Speedman continues to be the tough
          guy.

          SPEEDMAN

          you get'us back to the landing zone

          movie and they gave it to a white guy.

          LAZARUS
          Oh...I see...Put another way -- you're
          mad because I can act "black" better than
          you can.

          SANDUSKY
          Take it easy guys...

          REDYKULOUS
          (to Sandusky)
          You better rein in 'black like me' over
          here, before I put a foot in his white
          ass...

          LAZARUS
          Niggaz always got to be niggaz.
          This is truly over the line. Redykulous lunges at
          Lazarus. They fight.
          Redykulous throws a wide punch, that Lazarus deftly
          avoids, that hooks Portnoy right in the jaw.
          Sandusky jumps in and pries them apart.

          SANDUSKY
          Okay! That's enough! Jesus Christ! It's
          not enough we have people shooting at us!
          Now we have to kill each other?! Let's
          pull it together! This place is full of
          land mines! Or doesn't anyone's sense
          memory recall our director being blown
          up by onel?
          That shut them up.

          LAZARUS
          Sandusky is right... we could all learn a
          little from his common sense approach.
          From now on we walk Indian style,
          footstep upon footstep. Sandusky. . .you
          take first position.
          He breaks off a branch, and hands it to Sandusky, and
          pushes him out front. Sandusky gives him a look.

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 60.

          LAZARUS
          Your bravery shames us.
          Sandusky reluctantly starts down the path, tapping for
          land mines with the branch. The guys follow at a VERY
          safe distance.
          EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT AM l u I, I nhy
          CLOSE. ON Speedman's face. After a beat.a drop of water
          hits him in the.forehead. Then another.
          PULL BACK to reveal a pathetic shelter made. out of
          headphone. wire, and the In Style magazine.' The drip-is
          now becoming full on RAIN.
          He clutches an Equal packet and. the Cherry Chapstick.
          Gently, he puts the chapstick-to his face and takes a
          tentative bite, as though he were eating human flesh. He
          then tears open the Equal packet and empties its contents
          into his hand,.and takes. a lick, savoring every granule.
          He hears a rustling in the bushes across from him. A
          rodent? Food? Excited, he pulls out his Bowie knife and
          begins to stalk his prey.
          Now another movement behind.the bush, and a flash of.
          fur...
          Stealthily, he moves towards it. With cat like quickness,
          and knife drawn, he lunges onto the bush, A HUGE ROAR is
          heard...

          QUICK SHOTS OF: FANGS, BLOOD, AN EYEBALL, A HUGE PAW...
          Speedman is slashed, SOMETHING has got him in a choke
          hold...
          He reels around screaming.and stabbing wildly, brutally
          pummeling his attacker. He is. covered in blood, but
          looks ecstatic.

          SPEEDMAN
          Die! Die, you son of a bitch! Die!
          Speedman deals a death blow. And unleashes a primal
          VICTORY SCREAM. Spent, he finally gets a good look at
          his victim:
          A.small, cute, cuddly PANDA...
          Speedman looks horrified...

          SHOOT...
          He stumbles back against a tree.
          Suddenly we hear an odd VIBRATING SOUND. He jumps, and -
          frantically jams his hands in his pants it is the
          forgotten satellite phone he hid there way back when.

          CLOSE ON PHONE -- CALLER ID SAYS "RICK PECK"
          Speedman answers...

          INT. AGENCY OFFICE -- L.A. --DAY

          Rick is on a Pilates machine in is office with a HOT

          WE INTERCUT BETWEEN THEM

          down, it's fine. This is a no-brainer.
          Thank GOD you're out of the country.

          SPEEDMAN

          SPEEDMAN

          peroxide and some lime. Your gonna wanna
          cut the body in quarters ... the femurs are
          gonna be a bitch... that's normal...
          Speedman'nods eagerly, absorbing it all, not noticing a

          PIANO. WIRE BEING SLIPPED AROUND HIS NECK...
          Suddenly, he'is being choked.-He drops the phone, gasping
          for.air...

          RICK (O.S.)
          Chris? Breathe.! It's gonna be ok.. I'm
          calling that publicist right now, the one
          J Lo hired when she was'hammered and
          killed that kid with her Jetski.
          A guerilla shoots the phone. They quickly tie Speedman.up
          and whisk him'off into the jungle.

          EXT. FLAMING DRAGON COMPOUND -- DAWN

          Speedman is being led through the courtyard in:shackles.
          He looks up to the guard towers.
          There are security cameras everywhere. In Speedman''s
          mind, movie cameras. He nods, into it.

          SPEEDMAN
          (under his breath)
          Alright. P.O.W camp. Scene 67..Bring it
          on Dorf.

          INT. CODY AND FOUR LEAF'S DETENTION HUT

          Cody is just coming to. Four Leaf is already at the
          slatted window, watching...

          CODY
          Where are we?

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 63.

          FOUR LEAF
          In a detention hut. And they got
          Speedman...

          FOUR LEAF'S P.O.V. --
          A guard shoves Speedman hard with a rifle butt. Speedman
          over "acts" the pain.

          BACK ON CODY AND FOUR LEAF
          Cody gets up, starting to freak out

          CODY
          What? Why? We gotta get outta here! Are
          they gonna kill us?
          Four Leaf turns on him, grabbing him with one of his
          hooks.

          FOUR LEAF
          Pull it together private! Shut your trap
          before you get us killed! You understand
          me , lilydick? !
          Cody backs off, still scared.

          INT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- LATER

          Speedman is in a windowless hut, his feet and hands tied
          to a chair.
          There are security cameras in the corners of the room,
          which Speedman continually plays to.
          Byong stands across from him, watching him calmly.

          A

          BYONG
          What were you doing in our poppy fields?

          SPEEDMAN

          (CONFUSED)
          Poppy fields?

          BYONG
          Who sent you here?

          'Tropic Thunder 64.

          BYONG

          (CALMLY)
          Perhaps some hot tea will make conversing.
          a little easier?

          SPEEDMAN
          You bastard.

          BYONG
          What? just thought you might like.
          some...

          SPEEDMAN
          Corporal Four Leaf Tayback. And oh.
          yeah. . .THIS is from my uncle... SAM!
          He HEAD BUTTS Byong in the face,. sending him reeling into
          the back wall.
          Beat.

          SPEEDMAN
          (under his breath)
          You.ok? You leaned into it, man.orry.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. BAMBOO CAGE --.DAY

          A pissed off Byong and a couple of guards throw Speedman
          into a small cage that is suspended by rope over the edge
          of-a marsh.
          He looks around, impressed with the production design. He
          looks up,.sees another security camera observing him. He
          turns it on.

          SPEEDMAN
          May God protect you from the mighty arm
          of the 51st Tropic Thunder to the end! My
          men will seek you out and mete. out a
          cruel justice!-
          Byong and the guards look at him, a bit confused.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. RICE PADDY -- DAY

          Looking up we see a circle of faces. Our guys, looking
          down on something awful.. . .that thing is:

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 65.
          PORTNOY, delirious and groaningt

          SANDUSKY
          I think he's dead.
          A wet fart seeps out of Portnoy.

          REDYKULOUS
          No. Just smells like hens dead. Smelled

          44M
          like that all night.

          LAZARUS
          What's wrong with him?

          PORTNOY

          (LYING)
          Nothing! Probably just the beginning
          stages of some ... . kinda...jungle fever.
          More bad noises.

          PORTNOY
          If we can work out some rig to carry mï¿½? I
          think it might subside in a little bit...
          No one touches him.

          LAZARUS
          Alright. Sandusky?
          Sandusky looks up at him. Is he serious?

          SANDUSKY
          What?

          LAZARUS
          You and Redykulous are gonna have to
          carry Portnoy. God help you.
          He marches off.

          SANDUSKY
          God help me?

          REDYKULOUS
          God help him that bitch ever find his
          blackface minstrel show ass alone with me
          in the real world.
          Redykulous and Sandusky shake their heads and gather up
          Portnoy on a make shift stretcher.

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 66.

          EXT. HILLTOP

          Our guys are humping, with Fats in the makeshift
          stretcher.
          They look exhausted. As they crest. the ridge, Redykulous
          spots something.
          ''I , I n n4ï¿½N11

          REDYKULOUS
          Look!
          From behind, Sandusky grabs him and forces him to the
          ground.

          SANDUSKY
          SHH! Everybody down!
          The guys hit the dirt. Lazarus crawls up to join them.
          He pulls out his binoculars, and surveys the scene.

          I

          BINOCULAR POV
          It is the Flaming Dragon compound...

          ON THE GUYS

          " LAZARUS
          Fook me! I knew it!

          -SANDUSKY
          Knew what?

          LAZARUS
          "EXT. P.O.W. PRISON CAMP -- DAY"! Oranges
          and Lemons,,, the bells of St. Clements.
          Speedman was right. We 'are shooting the
          movie.
          Sandusky grabs the binoculars and starts'looking...

          LAZARUS
          (to himself),
          How could I be so stupid.

          SANDUSKY
          I don't think so... . looks to me like some
          sort of heroin processing plant. Look at
          the cooking vats, and the guards.
          Sandusky continues looking through the binoculars.

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 67.

          LAZARUS
          How do you know all,this?

          SANDUSKY
          It was a long trip. I read the in-flight
          magazine. We're in the Golden Triangle,
          the biggest drug producer in the world.
          Uh-oh.

          BINOCULAR POV
          It is SPEEDMAN, who is being dipped in and out of the
          water in his bamboo cage, while a bunch of guards stand
          around and laugh. Whenever he comes up for air, he is

          YELLING:

          SPEEDMAN

          CUT!1
          (into the water, then out)

          CUT1!

          BACK TO 'SCENE

          LAZARUS
          What do you see?

          SANDUSKY
          It doesn't look good.
          Lazarus grabs the binoculars.

          LAZARUS
          Sweet Mother of Jaysus.
          Suddenly: GUNFIRE ERUPTS ALL AROUND!
          A BAND OF GUERILLAS have spotted them and are running at
          them, firing automatic weapons...
          The guys scream, and start a frantic retreat down the
          hill. Portnoy suddenly gets well enough to run out of his
          stretcher for dear life...
          In fact, he is actually beating them down the hill.. .when
          suddenly WHUMP! He falls into a PIT!

          PORTNOY

          HELP! GUYS! WAIT!
          REDYKULOUS stops and turns around and runs back to him,
          heroically pulling him out. BUT...

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 68.
          There is more fire coming all around. He gives up,
          reverses tactics, and starts KICKING PORTNOY IN THE
          CHEST, trying to KICK HIM INTO THE HOLE !

          11

          PORTNOY
          Ow! Fuck Dude! What the fuck?!
          He screams in pain! Finally, WHUMP!! He disappears
          into the'hole. REDYKULOUS whistles for the guys to join
          him, and they all pile into the hole.

          IN, THE HOLE
          Totally black... . they huddle, trying to muffle their
          heavy breathing...

          ABOVE. THE HOLE
          The guerillas all frantically look around for the guys.
          No sign of them. One of them signals for them to keep
          moving.

          HOLE
          Footsteps can be heard above leaving the area. Sandusky
          lights a match. Portnoy is weeping in pain.

          SANDUSKY
          Must be one of those underground tunnels.
          The-cou-ntr-y-is-l-itte-red-with them. Je-f-f
          must have found one of the entrances,:.
          Portnoy is on his side in pain, whimpering.

          PORTNOY
          My ass...I think I took one in the ass...

          SANDUSKY
          Lemme see...
          Sandusky rolls him.over, and off camera, helps him remove
          his pants... All the guys recoil in horror.

          REDYKULOUS

          AWW JEEESUS MAN!

          SANDUSKY
          How did it get infected so fast?
          More ad libs of disgust...

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 69.

          SANDUSKY'
          Okay Jeff...This is gonna hurt like hell,
          but I have to take my finger and see how
          deep the slug is, and if I can dig it
          out. Take a breath. Redykulous, hold his
          hand...
          Beat... Sandusky puts his hand off camera.

          I

          PORTNOY
          Hey Dude! What are you doing! Cut it
          out! That's not the bullet hole. The
          bullet hole is over here!
          It dawns on the guys that they have NOT been looking at
          the bullet hole. Ad-libs of even MORE disgust.

          SANDUSKY
          OH! my bad. You just got grazed. You're
          gonna be fine.

          EXT. BAMBOO CAGE -- DAY

          Speedman is exhausted, slumped in his cage. He is covered
          in a few leeches. Byong appears with his usual cadre of
          guards. He nods, and they grab Speedman, and drag him
          out of the cage.

          EXT. FLAMING DRAGON HQ - COURTYARD

          Byong leads Speedman to the center of the courtyard. A
          HUSH falls over the soldiers.
          They begin to part, as someone very important is
          arriving.
          Finally, the unseen leader emerges. He is a LITTLE BOY,
          no older than 12 years old, but has the eyes of a killer.
          He smokes a cigar. This is TRAN.
          He stops in front of Speedman, staring him down. Then, in
          a show of alpha male dominance, he tears his shirt off,
          revealing an impressive set of gruesome tattoos -- a
          flaming dragon raping a monkey, raping a skull, raping a
          rat. He holds a stick.

          SPEEDMAN

          CODY AND FOUR LEAF ARE MARCHED OUT. Cody looks scared out.
          of his mind. Speedman takes this in.
          Traci nods, and TWO GUARDS start to BEAT THE BEJEESUS out
          of Cody and Four Leaf. Then Tran gets out his own stick
          and starts to BEAT SPEEDMAN...

          TRAN

          DO YOU WANT THEM TO DIE? DO YOU WANT THEM

          TO DIE!!

          Tran cocks his head curiously. He stops beating him..He
          signals.for the guards to stop beating the others. A long
          beat.

          TRAN
          Say that. again.,

          He threatens to hit him, Speedman recoils.

          INT. TRAN'S QUARTERS -- DAY

          Speedman is now seated in a comfortable, ornate chair,
          though his feet and hands are still bound. Tran and
          Byong and a few cohorts, stand across from him,
          whispering.

          TRAN'S ENTOURAGE

          You are Simple Jack?

          SPEEDMAN
          What? You.. You saw Simple Jack?

          TRAN
          We love the tale of this man, Simple
          Jack.
          Tran snaps his fingers, and an assistant shows Speedman a
          battered VHS BOX OF SIMPLE JACK. Speedman looks lovingly
          at it.

          TRAN
          We do not have many luxury here. Simple
          Jack is the only movie we possess. We
          have watched it many, many times. How is
          the word? Genius?
          Speedman smiles big. They smile back at him. It's a
          small world after all.

          BODYGUARD
          (broken English)
          You should have got Oscar.

          SPEEDMAN

          No, I mean it is great to.be nominated,..
          if you are, or that's what I hear.
          Whatever. It's a popularity contest.
          It's totally political, you have to lobby

          He pulls out a cell phone.

          TRAM
          Is it possible to.have picture?

          SPEEDMAN
          Oh, sure, absolutely.
          Speedman tries to throw an arm around Tran, a guard grabs
          the arm., and twists it back. Speedman shrieks in pain.

          TRAN
          You mustn't touch me.
          The guard snaps the picture.

          ABODYGUARD
          That came out really good.

          EXT. FLAMING DRAGON COURTYARD -- NIGHT

          The entire camp is assembled. Guards lead Speedman onto a
          platform; behind Tran.

          Yes. Begin.

          SPEEDMAN
          Hey, I know you're big fans and that's

          GREAT--
          Tran smacks Speedman in the, head with a rifle butt.
          Speedman crumples to the ground. The crowd cheers.

          SPEEDMAN

          Tran stands over him, screaming into his face:

          EXT. HOLE -- DUSK

          Sand}asky slowly lifts his head out, surveying the
          territory. It looks clear. He drops back down.

          INT. HOLE -- DUSK

          The actors look miserable. Portnoy-looks.like his face is
          going to fall off

          SANDUSKY
          It looks clear, but I can't be sure. I
          say we stay in here till it's dark.

          REDYKULOUS
          I can't believe this is how it ends for
          Redykulous. I'm a triple platinum
          recording artist., Shit.

          PORTNOY
          (shivering and wheezing)
          I gotta get back to the hotel. I'm not
          gonna make.it...

          SANDUSKY
          Forget it. That guard patrol knows we're
          out'here. They'll be looking for us.
          Anyway, Speedman's in that compound. And
          no one else knows but us.

          LAZARUS
          That's right. So here's the plan.
          Everyone leans forward expectantly.

          LAZARUS
          We sneak out of here, make our way back
          to the hotel and once we're safe, we
          alert the government of Speedman's
          situation.

          REDYKULOUS
          Sounds good.

          SANDUSKY
          Whoa whoa whoa ... . wait! So, we're just
          gonna leave him here?

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 75.

          REDYKULOUS
          Yeah, and I don't wanna spend another
          minute getting the full on smell'o vision
          in this hole with his stinky ass.
          Everyone agrees. They start packing up. Sandusky looks
          horrified.
          SANDUSKY Au II4
          WAIT! Look, I don't think I've met a more
          wildly self involved human than Speedman,
          but you're just gonna leave him here? I
          mean, come on. He's a person, guys.
          These drug lords are killers. I mean,
          they eat their enemies. We leave him
          alone now, he doesn't have a chance in
          hell.

          LAZARUS,
          That tosser is in there because of his
          own stupidity. As far as I'm concerned,
          he brought it on himself.

          REDYKULOUS
          Besides, how could we possibly rescue
          him? Get real, Sandusky, we don't know
          what the fuck we doing out here.

          SANDUSKY
          We've gotten this far. Look, we're making
          a movie about one of the greatest rescues
          ever. It's a true story,, right? I mean,
          those guys weren't superheroes! They
          were just put in extra-ordinary
          circumstances, and they rose to the
          occasion.

          PORTNOY
          Yeah, but they were trained soldiers.
          They knew how to take care of themselves.

          SANDUSKY
          And we don't? They believed they could do
          it. They believed in each other. Look,
          I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.

          (BEAT)
          I mean, some of us might not come back.

          REDYKULOUS
          You mean, like, not on the same flight?
          Sandusky just looks at them. They know that is not what
          he meant.

          you,.â¢but you're gonna have to kick some
          time, and it might as well be now.
          (he turns to Lazarus)
          Kirk, I've always admired you as an
          actor. But as a person, I have to say,
          not that impressive.' You got a.few
          Oscars. Got any balls?
          Lazarus takes this in.

          SANDUSKY
          Redyk. Whadda.you say? You talk a good
          game, but how's it gonna feel when you're

          man to die back here? You gonna rhyme
          about that? ,
          There is a long beat.

          REDYKULOUS
          Shit. I only wish they was filming this
          for my show. I'm in.
          He looks to LazaruS.,Lazarus takes a long dramatic pause..
          Then...

          (with resolve)
          We could fooster about for donkey's
          years..Let:'s quit acting the maggot and
          nix that mentaller.

          WE INTERCUT BETWEEN THEM

          BYON G
          Yes, that was Chris. But you will not
          speak with him again. And do not bother
          trying to trace this call.

          RICK
          What's going on? Who is this?

          BYONG
          We are Flaming Dragon. Speedman is with
          us now.
          There is a long silence as Rick processes this. Then he
          nods slowly.

          RICK
          Oh. Really. Well I never heard of your
          little agency. But if you wanna poach my
          client? Lemme tell you something. His
          career's been in a death spiral since
          Simple Jack, so why don't you all go fuck
          yourselves! Oh, and I bet he hasn't even
          told you about the whole panda thing! He
          killed a panda! And next time you're at
          a cocktail party with Paris Hilton, or at
          Kate Mantellini's choking down some egg
          whites with Ron Howard, DON'T LET THAT

          SANDUSKY'
          Here's us. Here's the compound.Here's
          where Speedman was. It looks like they
          move him at night, cause he's not here
          now. Unfortunately we have no idea what
          the layout of that place is.

          sneak him out.

          PORTNOY

          (intermittent pain noises)
          Back in '98, I did a low budget titty
          comedy for skinemax, "Sex Camp". Anyway,
          me and the campers from the uncool camp
          had to break into the rich girls' camp.
          So we did it by building a catapult.
          They shot us over the wall and we
          parachuted down.
          The guys all look at each other... then finally:

          LAZARUS
          That's the stupidest idea I've ever
          heard.

          SANDUSKY
          Yeah. Sorry Portnoy. That's lame. I say
          we wait till just before dawn and sneak
          over the fence. Take our chances. You
          guys ok with that?
          The group nods in approval.

          SANDUSKY
          Good. Then let's get some rest. Me and
          Redyk are on first watch.
          (to Lazarus)
          I'll wake you in two hours, and we'll
          switch.
          They break up. Portnoy comes up to Sandusky, extremely
          freaked out.

          Yes you are.

          PORTNOY
          Then you gotta tie me up. I'm serious.
          Tie me to a tree. No matter how much I
          scream, or however much-I plead, you.must
          not untie me. I will be cunning, I will
          be in pain, and Iwill lie. The devil
          works this way. I will say, do, and
          excrete many regrettable things. But.no
          matter what.. .you must leave me alone.

          Speedman bows, exhausted and exhilarated. The old women
          .politely applaud. A new group forms in front of his cage.
          Speedman stands. He sighs, and begins the movie over
          again...

          INT. CODY AND FOUR LEAF'S DETENTION HUT -- CONTINUOUS

          Cody and Four Leaf watch through the slat in their
          window.
          11l I I, I. Inti"

          FOUR LEAF
          That poor bastard. Looks like they coo-
          coo nested him.

          CODY

          (IMPATIENT)
          So what's the plan?

          FOUR LEAF
          What plan?

          CODY
          To get us out of here? Come on man, yoi4
          lived this, you gotta have an idea of how
          we can get out of here? Right?
          Four Leaf looks a little at a loss...

          FOUR LEAF
          (trying to be stoic)
          Sometimes the flowing stream can only
          move when... the water... dries up.

          CODY
          No offense, but what the hell does that
          mean?

          FOUR LEAF
          It means I'm,sick of your yappin'!

          CODY
          Come on man, you heard him back there.
          They wanna off us! We gotta escape! You

          GOTTA--
          Four Leaf suddenly puts his hook hand right up to Cody's
          neck. Cody instinctively blocks it with his hand.

          FOUR LEAF
          I gotta what? Take on the whole compound
          by myself!

          CODY
          Stop it man! You're chokin' me!

          

          

          

          
          .Tropic Thunder 82.
          Cody tries to push him away. They get into a wrestling
          match, hand to hook... Cody is pushing against Four
          Leaf... then four Leaf tries to pull away.. But Cody
          holds on to his hooks... he holds on until... HE PULLS
          THEM OFF! Revealing... TWO PERFECT HANDS.

          CODY
          AHH! Who the hell are you?
          Four Leaf looks down, sheepishly.

          EXT. CAMPSITE -- NIGHT

          PORTNOY,. tied to a tree, looking miserable and fidgety..
          We TRACK PAST HIM to...
          SANDUSKY AND.REDYKULOUS, who sit upright, back to back,
          leaning against one another. Sandusky smokes a
          cigarette. It's quiet except for the hum of cicadas, and.
          the odd jungle noise.

          SANDUSKY
          Wow... .look at all those stars. Makes a
          guy feel pretty small.

          REDYKULOUS
          Yup.

          SANDUSKY
          Back in LA, we don't get stars like this.
          I wonder why there are so many here?

          PORTNOY (O.S.)
          Ohhhh...jeeesssusss..it's horrrrible.:...

          REDYKULOUS
          Man, how can;, you be talking about stars?
          We might not make it outta here tomorrow.

          SANDUSKY
          I don't know. I give us pretty good odds.
          Redykulous looks at'his watch, and lets out a chuckle.

          SANDUSKY
          What's so funny?

          REDYKULOUS
          Nothin'..

          PORTNOY (O.S.)
          .I can't feel my legs!...

          REDYKULOUS
          I'm just thinking about Lill Kantankerous
          Bitch.

          SANDUSKY
          Who?

          PORTNOY (O.S.)

          (DRY HEAVES)

          REDYKULOUS
          She's a rapper I'm producing, a twelve
          year old girl. Her first single drops
          tomorrow and I'm not even gonna be there
          to see it.

          PORTNOY (O.S.)
          Ohhhhh GOD! THERE'S BARBED WIRE IN MY

          URINE!

          REDYKULOUS
          I pulled her off the streets six months
          ago.

          SANDUSKY
          You did that?

          REDYKULOUS
          Well, not literally, she was trapped in a
          dead end record deal with Rick Rubin.
          Didn't even have a lawyer. Huh. And here
          I am on the other side of the world.
          About to die for a guy I barely even
          know. Makes Redykulous wonder what's it
          all about.

          SANDUSKY
          Yeah. . .well at least you have someone to
          think about.

          PORTNOY (O.S.)

          (TTTTTHHHHWWAAAAAPPP... GURGLE)

          REDYKULOUS
          You single?

          SANDUSKY
          Yeah,... .I guess. I dunno. I got a girl.
           But it's not too serious.

          EYES!!!! (VOMITING NOISE)

          SANDUSKY
          I don't think we're in love.

           PORTNOY (O.S.)
          Ohh... . thank God...its Over ...it's
          finally over...

          SANDUSKY:
          It'.s kind of depressing. That feeling of
          not having anyone who really loves you..
          Redykuloils. puts his arm around Sandusky to comfort him..

          REDYKULOUS
          Hey, it's cool.. I think you're extremely
          lovable.
          Weird silence.

          SANDUSKY
          What?

          REDYKULOUS
          (removing his arm)
          I mean like ...like,. I know what you mean.

          SANDUSKY
          .No you don't. What would the great
          Redykulous, know about Girl Problems.
          You're ten girls deep 24 hours a day!

          REDYKULOUS
          .That's the problem.

          I know-impossible huh. That's what I
          say sometimes, but its true. Talk abort
          living a loveless life. At least you

          SHATTERED GLASS RUBBING AGAINST AN OPEN

          WOUND!

          REDYKULOUS
          When I think of the nights, alone in my
          penthouse, when I've longed for the
          gentle touch of another dude, to feel his
          skin against mine, or his sweet breath on
          my face.

          PORTNOY (O.S.)

          REDYKULOUS,(cont'd)
          Most of the time, when I'm writing about
          ho's in my songs, 'I really mean Niggaz.
          Creatively, that's the only way I can
          cope.

          SANDUSKY
          So what! You're gay! You're also a great
          artist and-businessman ... why not rap
          about that?

          and fragrances go south? It's all such a
          lie.
          Now he begins to cry .a. little. Sandusky embraces him.

          SANDUSKY.
          Shhh...shhh... .shhh..shhh..shhh... .That's

          SANDUSKY
          I'm not gonna tell anyone, and your not
          gonna shoot me... .th-at's it...l-et -tout.
          Redykulous pulls back, and collects himself.

          REDYKULOUS
          Aww shit... (sniff sniff) I can't. believe
          it's possibly the last day of my life,
          and I'm not even gonna be able to let my
          fans know how truly 'Utterly Redykulous I
          really am.

          INT. CODY AND FOUR LEAF'S DETENTION HUT -- NIGHT

          Cody, still awkwardly holding the hooks, is yelling at
          Four Leaf.

          CODY
          So all of "Tropic Thunder" is bullshit?

          FOUR LEAF
          No! Four Leaf and his men were real, it
          happened!

          CODY
          Are you even a VET!?

          FOUR LEAF
          YES! Well ...no! I mean, kinds! Yeah! Not
          exactly. I served honorably in what they
          called the "forced service". Sanitation
          Detail at the United States Pentagon.

          CODY
          So you were some two bit criminal who got
          caught and sentenced to clean toilets at
          the Pentagon? I IDOLIZED YOU MAN!

          FOUR LEAF
          God-dammit, would you LISTEN! I was a
          fuckup, sure, but one day as I was
          cleaning the office of some Top-Brass big-
          wig, I came across a file headed for the
          shredder marked top secret. It was Four
          Leaf Tayback's file. A nobody. No family.
          Nothing. Killed in Action. They were
          gonna bury the whole thing. Total black
          op.

          CODY
          So you decided to take his identity?

          FOUR LEAF
          NO! I gave him one! I wrote the story
          And I gave the American people a hero!
          Yes, I am not technically Four Leaf, but
          if I didn't pretend to be him then nobody
          woulda ever known who he was! See what
          I'm sayin'?

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 88.

          CODY
          And you cashed in!

          FOUR LEAF
          I was a fuck up my whole life! This guy
          had a story worth-telling, and nobody
          woulda ever known!
          Cody slumps in the corner, looking spent and lost.

          FOUR LEAF
          I'm sorry, man.. I'm responsible: for this
          .whole mess.

          EXT. JUNGLE -- PRE-DAWN

          He struggles to his feet, doing a celebratory dance. He
          immediately gets nauseous again and heaves.

          scamper over...
           Finally, it's PORTNOY'S turn. He's clearly too heavy.
           The fence groans under'his weight. He launches himself --
          and...
          THWANG!!! Slams painfully into the razor wire of the
          fence.
          GUARDS hear the noise. They raise their weapons and
          listen.. They see nothing in the pre-dawn darkness...
          The actors run to the wall and clumsily pull PORTNOY
          down, just in time.
          Everyone's inside the perimeter... they quickly make their
          way along the fence line to the entrance of the main
          building, ducking away to avoid a LONE GUARD.

          INT. MAIN BUILDING

          Sandusky makes a series of hand gestures, indicating for
          them to'split up and search for Speedman. A beat. The
          guys all shrug, not understanding. Sandusky repeats the
          hand gestures. Finally he has to speak.
          i 1, 11 11^ï¿½%

          SANDUSKY I 4I4
          (in a loud whisper, also
          signalling what.he's saying)
          FAN OUT! 'GO ROOM BY ROOM ! IF YOU SEE, nci 16,
          SPEEDMAN, give the signal!
          We follow PORTNOY, working his wayldown a hall. He peaks
          around a half opened door...

          A DARKENED ROOM
          .PORTNOY turns on his flashlight to reveal he is in fact
          in... HEROIN HEAVEN! Wall to wall packets, ready,for
          shipment.. PORTNOY is paralyzed. He spots a box with the
          words "For U.S.A., 100% pure, dilute before ingesting".
          His mouth LITERALLY waters, and'a drop. of .spittle oozes
          from his bottom lip. He doesn't know what to do. He
          gently takes two handfuls of the heroin from the box.
          marked "pure". It's like holding two grenades...

          HALLWAY
          Sandusky moves silently toward a door. He kicks it'open
          to reveal...

          SPEEDMAN
          Shackled to the floor. Delirious, he sits bolt upright.

          SPEEDMAN
          You mu-mu-make me ha-aa-ppy.

          SANDUSKY
          Oh sweet Jesus. Hold tight, Buddy! I'll
          be right back!
          Sandusky runs off to get the guys.

          HALLWAY
          Sandusky rounds up Redyk and Lazarus, points to both of
          his eyes, signalling that he's got "eyes",on Speedman.
          They take a step in that direction. Redykulous stops
          them, and makes a made up, absurd signal for "Where is
          Portnoy?", somehow trying to mime looking for a fat guy.
          No one knbws what he is doing.

          REDYKULOUS

          (FRUSTRATED)
          Where is Portnoy?!

          SANDUSKY
          Shhh!
          A muffled, anguished animal noise that could only be
          PORTNOY emanates from a nearby door. They run towards it.
          Redykulous kicks it in.

          HEROIN HEAVEN
          The 'gang flies in, to discover Portnoy holding the bags,
          crying.

          REDYKULOUS
          What are you doing, man!

          SANDUSKY
          Come on, let's go! We found Speedmani

          PORTNOY
          I don't care! It doesn't matter what I
          do! I'll always be a screw-up! No one
          will ever respect me...

          REDYKULOUS
          That's not true! Listen, back in the
          day, I used to think I couldn't produce a
          record simply because...

          SANDUSKY
          .he's gay.
          Uh-oh. That's not what Redykulous was about to say. Beat.

          REDYKULOUS
          Actually I was going to say poor.

          SANDUSKY
          Sorry...

          Tropic Thunder 94.

          LAZARUS
          Listen.. .Don't be crazy Portnoy --you're
          not a fuck up. You'make millions of
          people laugh!

          PORTNOY
          You said my farts made them laugh! Leave
          me ALONE!!

          REDYKULOUS.,
           That ain't true Portnoy! Lotta people be
          fartin' and not be gettin' 20 large a pop
          for it!

          OUTSIDE THE DOOR
          .TWO GUARDS hear the noises inside, head. in to check it
          out.

          HEROIN ROOM
          The guys hear the guards enter the far side of the room.
          They can't see the guys through the.shelves packed with
          heroin packets.

          SANDUSKY
          Damnit! We need to go!

          PORTNOY
          No, I can't do it.
          (-l-ooking-in the-pac-ket )
          I need it! I need it!! This'is all I
          deserve.

          REDYKULOUS
          Come on, man...
          And.the guards emerge. around a corner! They jab their
          rifles.at:the guys and SCREAM AT THEM TO PUT THEIR HANDS

          UP!
          The guys all slowly raise their hands...
          Then, in a moment of craziness, PORTNOY CHARGES THE

          GUARDS, PIE-ING THEM IN THE FACE WITH THE HEROIN PACKETS.

          PORTNOY

          LAUGH AT THAT!! LAUGH AT THAT BASTARD!!
          The guards let off a BURST OF MACHINE GUN FIRE as Portnoy
          grinds it into their noses...

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 95.

          INT. CODY AND FOUR LEAF'S DETENTION HUT -- CONTINUOUS

          They hear the fire. Four Leaf runs to the window. Through
          it he sees the commotion...

          CODY
          What?

          FOUR LEAF
          Something's happening! Get me the hooks!

          HEROIN ROOM
          Portnoy watches as the white faced guards fall to their
          knees, choking and groggy. After a beat, they collapse.

          PORTNOY
          Let's move! We got about sixteen hours
          before they wake up!
          They run out.

          SPEEDMAN'S CELL
          The guys run in. Redykulous breaks the lock off
          Speedman's ankle with his rifle butt. Sandusky keeps
          watch by the door.,

          REDYKULOUS,
          C'mon! We're busting you out!

          SPEEDMAN
          Muh-my nnnname is Juh-Jack. Some folks
          call muh-me Simple Juh-Jack.

          REDYKULOUS
          What's wrong with him?

          SANDUSKY
          I think he thinks he's Simple Jack. Like
          from the movie?

          LAZARUS'
          Shite. I was afraid of this. The same
          thing happened to me when I played Neil
          Armstrong in "Moonshot". They found me in
          an alley in Burbank re-entering the
          Earth's atmosphere in an old refrigerator
          box.

          REDYKULOUS
          I heard that movie was good.

          SANDUSKY
          Can you fix him?!

          LAZARUS
          I'll try.
          Lazarus takes Speedman's face in his hands, forces him to
          look at him.

          LAZARUS
          .You're Chris Michael Speedman!

          SPEEDMAN
          Ah 1-1-likes pie.

          LAZARUS
          You're the greatest star in the world!
          There's a flicker of intelligence in Speedman's eyes. It
          passes.

          INT. CODYAND FOUR LEAF'S DETENTION HUT -- CONTINUOUS

          Four Leaf wedges one of the hooks in the. door jamb, and
          Cody does the same with the other. In one fell swoop,
          :they bust. the door off its hinges.

          E-X-T . DE-T-EN-T-ION-HU-T----DAWN-
          They emerge into the chaos. IT IS DAYLIGHT NOW. A GUARD
          runs by, Four Leaf uses the hook to trip him up. Cody
          knocks him out and grabs his machine gun. He tosses the
          guard's pistol to Four Leaf.

          CODY
          By the way, what's your name anyway?

          FOUR LEAF
          Marvin Kaminsky.

          CODY
          you ever been in this jungle?

          FOUR LEAF
          Nope. First time outta the states
          actually.
          He shoots off a round and they run for cover.

          INT. SPEEDMAN'S CELL -- CONTINUOUS

          Lazarus is right in Speedman's face. He seems to be
          getting clearer...

          LAZARUS
          The world needs you! It` needs its stars!
          You make people forget how awful and 1ï¿½ I Ii I. 1 ,14M
          depressing their lives are! People love
          your work! And... I love your work, too.
          Speedman is quiet.

          SPEEDMAN I
          Uhhhh-uh-I'm... Spah-speeedman?

          LAZARUS
          Simple Jack was magnificent!

          SANDUSKY
          Is it working?

          LAZARUS
          JESUS! Give me time, Sandusky! I'm not re-
          programming a VCR!!
          (back to Speedman)
          You really committed yourself. And for
          that you DESERVED AN OSCAR!
          Speedman registers this.

          LAZARUS

          (FRUSTRATED)

          C'MON CHRIS! DAMMIT! YOU MUST KNOW WHO

          YOU ARE!
          Lazarus's own words make him stop and think.

          LAZARUS
          (almost to himself)
          You know who you are... . you do Chris.
          Long beat.

          LAZARUS
          Unlike me. What am I doing? I can't do
          this. How can I convince a man he is who
          we know he is, when I can't even convince
          myself of the same thing.
          He lets go of Speedman, and begins to break down.

          LAZARUS
          Am I Redykulous? ... AM I!...Or.am I just
          acting like that's who I am?
          No. The sad fact is... I'm not Sergeant

          .Armstrong. I'm not even .Kirk Lazarus.
          (a beat)
          I have no idea who I am.
          The guys look at him... it's the first time he has let
          his guard down.

          SANDUSKY
          Kirk, this is NOT the time!

          LAZARUS

          He winks at Sandusky.

          REDYKULOUS
          That's right! We're.not what we're
          called, or who we pretend to be. We are
          what we are in our hearts. And to me,
          looking into your heart, you're a hero..
          Lazarus looks to Redykulous.

          LAZARUS
          You mean that?

          SPEEDMAN
          Now let's get the hell outta here!
          Speedman leads the men to the door. Sandusky tosses

          Thanks Kevin.

          SANDUSKY

          gotta show us the way outta here Chris.

          Follow me.
          This time they do...

          HALLWAY
          The guys run toward the opening to the courtyard,
          Speedman leading the way...

          EXT. FLAMING DRAGON COURTYARD -- CONTINUOUS

           They huddle close to the wall, unseen, surveying the
          situation: about 20 GUARDS on full alert... a JEEP about
          30 feet away... beyond that, A HELIPAD with the
          compound's chopper, maybe 200 yards in the distance...

          SPEEDMAN
          That's their supply chopper.

          SANDUSKY
          If we could create a diversion, we could
          get to that jeep and drive it right over
          there...

          handy too.

          SPEEDMAN
          You want a diversion? I'll give you a
          diversion. Is this baby loaded?
          He holds up the machine gun...

          SANDUSKY
          Yeah, but...
          And with'that, Speedman runs out in to the courtyard,..
          the opposite direction from the jeep, doing a CRAZY WAR'

          WHOOP...
          A BUNCH OF GUARDS turns to,see.him... he does a-SUPER
          MACHO TUCK AND ROLL, landing perfectly and EMPTYING HIS

          CARTRIDGE ON. THE GUARDS...

          SANDUSKY
          (to.himself)
          .they're blanks...
          There is a long moment of silence as the guards just
          stare at Speedman. He seems a. bit surprised that. they are
          not dead,. as do the guards themselves. They cock their
          weapons, about to shoot him when.,..
          A HAIL OF-BULLET FIRE-erupts-behind-the-gu-ards... They
          turn...WE REVEAL CODY AND FOUR LEAF BEHIND THEM, THEIR

          GUNS FIRING INTO THE AIR!!

          SANDUSKY
          Let's move!
          The.guys jump into the jeep, Sandusky at the wheel, and
          'gun it..

          SANDUSKY
          Chris, come.on!
          Speedman jumps. into the jeep as it passes by. They are
          speeding toward the helipad.

          SPEEDMAN WATCHES FOUR LEAF AND CODY, WHO CONTINUE

          SHOOTING AT THE GUARDS...

          But they can't break away, they-are trying to run toward
          the jeep but are under too much fire...

          SPEEDMAN

          WE GOTTA GET THEM, GO AROUND!!
          Sandusky swings the wheel hard. . .the jeep careens back
          toward the firefight...they come in hard, and SKID TO A

          STOP NEXT TO FOUR LEAF AND CQDY..1.
          Cody jumps in the jeep, but FOUR LEAF DOESN'T...

          SANDUSKY
          Get in the Jeep!

          FOUR LEAF
          You go... I got real bullets! I'll cover
          you.. It's the only way you'll make it!

          CODY
          Marvin, you gotta --

          FOUR LEAF
          Just go!!
          Sandusky looks at Speedman... they both know he's right.
          They go... leaving Four Leaf in the dust, still firing...
          The jeep speeds up to the helipad... the guys jump out.
          Just as the last guy is out...

          BOOM! A HUGE BLAST FLIPS THE JEEP INTO THE AIR...
          Across the courtyard is TRAN... who just fired an RPG at
          our guys!
          The guys are freaked and shaken, but start to get in the
          chopper... Sandusky pushes Cody in...

          A

          SANDUSKY
          Start the chopper now Cody!
          Cody nods, getting his bearings... and hitting the
          ignition...the BLADES SLOWLY HUM TO LIFE, BEGINNING TO
          TURN... Portnoy grabs Cody's gun and hangs by the runner,
          shooting towards approaching guards...

          WHAT WE SEE NEXT SHOULD PLAY OUT VERY MUCH THE SAME AS

          THE OPENING OF THE MOVIE:
          Tran is reloading his RPG...

          LAZARUS

          WE'RE. ALL DEAD MEAT IF WE DON'T.LIFT OFF

          NOW!! DO IT CODY!!
          Cody reluctantly pulls up the throttle. The chopper.
          begins to LIFT OFF...

          SPEEDMAN.

          FOUR LEAF IS STILL OUT THERE!

          LAZARUS

          WE GOTTA GO! PORTNOY GET YER ASS IN THIS

          CHOPPER!!

          PORTNOY

          I'M TRYING!!
          Portnoy is not being heroic, he, is genuinely having
          trouble getting in.-the chopper.
          But then Speedman sees something...

          SPEEDMAN
          It's him...

          SPEEDMAN'S POV
          FOUR LEAF... much-like.Speedman playing him in the
          beginning of the. movie... Arms extended, his body riddled
          with bullets...

          LAZARUS

          FOOCK!
          Cody lowers the chopper ... Speedman jumps out...

          SPEEDMAN
          Cover me!
          Speedman runs towards Four Leaf, through a hailstorm of
          bullets...PORTNOY AND THE GUYS PROVIDE AS MUCH COVER AS

          THEY CAN...

          

          

          

          
          i- Tropic Thunder 103.
          Speedman reaches Four Leaf and collapses beside him,
          cradling his head.
          Trap's men continue to bear down on them...

          FOUR LEAF
          Go on...get outta here. I'm worm food,
          you dig?

          SPEEDMAN

          DON'T YOU DIE ON ME!
          (then totally surprised)
          You have hands?

          ON THE CHOPPER
          The guys are busy shooting off their attackers, but they
          see this moment happening...

          BACK TO SPEEDMAN AND FOUR LEAF
          The life is draining from Four Leaf (Marvin)...

          FOUR LEAF
          I ain't Four Leaf, Chris. We're in this
          mess because of me.

          SPEEDMAN
          (can't get over it)
          How did you get hands?

          FOUR LEAF
          I ain't never been worth a nothin'...and
          it's too late to start bein' a somethin'
          now.
          Speedman tries to understand. He is welling up with
          emotion.. .real emotion.

          FOUR LEAF

          (SINCERELY)
          But you... you can tell the story. . .You
          have to tell the real story...
          And Four Leaf... or Marvin... dies.
          Speedman begins to weep. Tears. Yes, he is crying, for
          real...

          AND WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL THIS PLAYING ON A GIANT VIDEO

          MOVIE STAR STYLE, HE UNLEASHES A BARRAGE OF MACHINE GUN

          FIRE, MOWING THEM DOWN,..

          HE SLINGS FOUR LEAF/MARVIN OVER HIS SHOULDER, AND RUNS

          FOR THE CHOPPER, STILL SHOOTING;..

          HE GETS THERE WITH PORTNOY, REDYK AND SANDUSKY PULLING

          As he gets near.the stage, KIRK LAZARUS (CAUCASIAN BUT

          EXT. FLAMING DRAGON COURTYARD -- DAY

          Peck is tied up, in ragged, prisoner clothes, hanging in
          the cage. He has been there a while.

          PECK
          Ok, look, you wanna go through this
          again, let's do it. I see more for you
          than this. This whole 'big fish in the
          little scary jungle pond' thing. I see
          you as a front man, as a leader, not just
          of this little rebel guerilla warrior
          group. I see it big picture. Is it music,
          is it movies? Is it a series on Fox? I
          don't know. But I do know it is not
          happening with you staring at me doing my
          "I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings" routine
          for you and the peanut gallery for
          another six months. It's old school
          already.
          TRAN and some HENCHMEN watch, unamused. Tran nods, one of
          the henchmen turns a handle which lowers the cage into
          the water. After a moment, it comes back up with a
          soaking Peck.

          PECK
          (not missing a beat)
          And it makes me sad to see you chomping
          on the stogie and you're not even
          fourteen or whatever. I'm thinking "what
          hole does that need to fill, that you
          have to keep dipping me into the water to
          somehow feel better about yourself?" I
          can be a partner to you, not just a
          captive.

          PECK (cont'd)
          But you have to allow me into your inner
          workings, into your headspace to
          facilitate that. And"to do that you gotta
          let me outta the cage,'both figuratively
          and literally. Until you can let me go, I
          you.can't let you go. Do you get that?
          He gets dunked in the water again.

          PECK
          Obviously not. Dare I bring up.a sore
          subject. Can we do a little business on
          the blackberry privileges? Cause you're
          killing me here.

               EXT. HOME MOVIE - 1982 - DAY


               A DAD tosses a baseball to his SON.  The boy swings, connects, 
               sends the ball flying.  DAD smiles. 
 
                                     BRANDON LANG'S VOICE
               That's me.  Five years old.  I remember that day.  Believe it 
               or not, I remember that hit.  I remember it because of the smile 
               that spread over my dad's face...
 

               EXT. HOME MOVIE - 1983 - DAY


               BRANDON shooting hoops.  DAD drinks a Bud, frowns as he misses. 
                
 
                                     BRANDON VOICEOVER
               I would've stood there all day to sink one.  Just to see that 
               smile...  
 

               EXT. HOME MOVIE - 1984 - DAY


               BRANDON runs, wears a too-big helmet and pads.  A DOG chases 
               him as DAD throws a football -- long pass -- TIME SLOWS and --

               To pop, sports were a religion.  To me, it was about purity, 
               a place where all wrongs could be made right, or at least temporarily 
               forgotten.  I was going to fill the whole house with trophies 
               for him.  There was no doubt in my mind, I was going to make 
               him happy...
 
               BRANDON catches the ball.  Blinding light, loud CHEERING and

               EXT. STADIUM - 1999 - NIGHT


               Our eyes adjust to see we're in a STADIUM.  It's a night game. 
                Stands packed.  A PLAY CLOCK fills the SCREEN.  It's the fourth 
               quarter.  Seven seconds left.  Score:  CAL WEST 31 / SOUTH WEST 
               NEVADA UNIVERSITY 27.  A bruised and battered UNLV QUARTERBACK 
               gets a play from the COACH, straps on his helmet as he runs back 
               to the huddle.  The name on the QUARTERBACK'S jersey -- B. LANG. 
                10 exhausted, desperate faces come close, hang on BRANDON'S 
               every word -- 
 
                                     BRANDON
               Last play.  Slant red, right back on two.  On two, Scottie.  
               It's a lock.  A guaranteed TD.  I've already seen it.  So relax. 
                There's nothing to worry about 'cept one thing -- after we win 
               and they're shoving cameras in your faces, I don't want to hear 
               any "Hi moms."  Guys, it's overdone, the fans are tired of it 
               and if you have to thank some one you can just thank me.  See 
               you in the end zone.
 
               The teams breaks, approaches the line.  Loud CROWD roar.

                                     BRANDON VOICEOVER
               I'd been a quarterback since pee-wee football.  Set high school 
               records.  Won state championships.  I wasn't driven by joy, it 
               wasn't winning as much as terror, pure and simple -- fear of 
               losing.

               South West Nevada needs a score.  Seven seconds on the clock. 
                22 yard line.  Win or lose, this has been a spectacular season 
               for Lang.  The big question, should he turn pro now or wait until 
               -- Lang's got the snap--
 
               BRANDON drops back.  A GIANT gets a hand on BRANDON'S jersey. 
                BRANDON pulls free, runs.  OPPONENTS charge his way, BRANDON 
               vaults, sails in the end zone, SCORES.  BRANDON rolls on his 
               back as an OPPOSING PLAYER hurtles in -- mid-air -- unable to 
               stop as -- 300-plus pounds come crashing onto BRANDON'S leg. 
                Sickening sound.  BRANDON clutches his strangely angled limb.
 
               
                                     BRANDON VOICEOVER
               ... My first thought was I can tape it and play next week.  Then 
               I puked.
 
               TEAMMATES surround BRANDON, many turning from the sight and --
 
               

               INT. EMERGENCY ROOM ENTRANCE - NIGHT


               BRANDON'S wheeled in.


               INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT


               SURGEONS regard the leg.  IVs are hooked up.

                                     BRANDON
               What's the rehab time?  

               The SURGEONS talk between themselves, impressed by the break. 
                
 
                                     BRANDON
               When do I play again?

               One DOCTOR examines his x-rays.  BRANDON grabs his smock. 

                                     BRANDON
               The patient's got a question!

               Anesthetic haze.  A wavy world is melting far, far away.

               Football's done, son...


               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY


               BRANDON'S in a hospital bed.  Big leg cast.  IV's in each arm. 
               
 
                                     MAN'S VOICE
               Brandon... Brandon, it's me.

               BRANDON opens his eyes, focuses on his FATHER (older, cheap suit, 
               beard stubble, clutching a $2 bouquet of flowers).  
 
                                     BRANDON'S DAD
               You okay?  I saw what happened on the tv.  Helluva thing that 
               happening like that.
 
                                     BRANDON
               (edge)

               What are you doing here?

                                     BRANDON'S DAD
               I brought some flowers.  From downstairs in the shop.  

                                     BRANDON
               (pressing the nurse's call button) 

               No, you gotta go -- where's the nurse? 

                                     BRANDON'S DAD
               I'm thinking of getting into a new program, Brandon.

               A NURSE comes fast through the door, watches unsure --

                                     BRANDON
               Could you get him out, please?  

                                     BRANDON'S DAD
               It's okay, we're fine, I'm his father.

                                     BRANDON
               Just get out!

               BRANDON tries to rise, IV'S coming loose.  The NURSE takes his 
               DAD'S arm, leads him out to the hall. 
 
                                     BRANDON'S DAD
               (pulling away, straightening)

               He didn't recognize me.  Must be all the drugs and all.  Boy's 
               been through a lot.
 
               (handing the NURSE the flowers) 

               If you could put these in some water and leave 'em in his room. 
                Before they die.
 
               BRANDON'S DAD nods thanks, departs down the corridor and --
 
               

               EXT. TRACT HOME - DAY


               Vegas desert.  It's raining.  A SWNU car pulls up.  The COACH 
               helps BRANDON out, on crutches now.  A middle-aged WOMAN and 
               a TEENAGE BOY stand under a rusty awning, waiting to greet him.
 
               
                                     BRANDON VOICEOVER
               It doesn't rain much in the desert.  Maybe it was that, or maybe 
               the look on my mother's face, or how fast coach left after getting 
               me up the steps, but I swore then and there -- no matter what, 
               I'd get back -- I would play again...
 

               INT. UNLV WEIGHT ROOM - 1997 - DAY


               Off-season.  The room's packed.  Loud hip hop plays.  BRANDON 
               limps in on a cane.  Back slaps.  ("B's back!" "The man!")

               EXT. SOUTH WEST NEVADA UNIVERSITY TRACK - DAY 


               Sprinters dart by.  Here comes BRANDON.  Several months have 
               passed.  Big ass brace on his leg.  A GIRL'S TRACK TEAM bounds 
               past like a herd of gazelles.  BRANDON presses on, possessed.
 
               

               EXT. PRACTICE FIELD - DAY


               The TEAM'S practicing for a new season.  BRANDON'S on the sideline, 
               flanked by the COACH and TEAM DOCTOR.
 
                                     BRANDON VOICEOVER
               Doc told me it would take years to heal.  One bad hit and it'd 
               be over.  But the team needed me and I had to play to get drafted. 
                I figured I'd take a chance...
 
               BRANDON looks at the field, the PLAYERS, the empty stands and-- 
                
 

               EXT. SOUTH WEST NEVADA UNIVERSITY STADIUM - 1997 - DAY


               CROWDED arena.  Electrifying scene.  BRANDON'S suited on the 
               sidelines.  Kick-off.  A SWNU PLAYER returns the ball.  
 
                                     BRANDON VOICEOVER
               Every minute of recovery I'd dreamt about this moment.  There 
               were NFL scouts in the stands.  I knew what happened next.
 
               
               BRANDON leads his team onto the field.  Into the huddle --

                                     BRANDON
               Let's ease back into it with our bread 

               and butter -- TD first play.  We're going 

               deep.  Split right.  Deep two on three!

               (coming up to the line)

               Red 38!  Red 28!  Set!  Set--

               BRANDON drops back.  Blitz.  Brandon about to throw when one 
               of his own LINEMEN is knocked into him and -- BRANDON'S off balance. 
                Too much pressure on that leg and in one horrible moment... 
               it buckles.  BRANDON falls.  The play whistled dead.  
 
                                     BRANDON VOICEOVER
               ...It was over.  I could've gone out with class, a gritty smile 
               and a little wave to the crowd from a stretcher, instead I opted 
               to go psycho on national tv.
 
               The PLAYER who hit him leans down to help.  BRANDON grabs his 
               face mask, starts punching.  Pure rage.  A REFEREE steps in and 
               BRANDON slugs him, slams his face in the turf.  LINEMEN yank 
               BRANDON off as the bloody REF struggles to get free and --
 
               
               TV SCREEN -- jim rome sports show

               A highlight reel plays a tape of the incident -- BRANDON seen 
               struggling with PLAYERS as the roughed-up REF crawls away --
 
               
                                     JIM ROME
               Welcome to the jungle!  Hey clones, do you believe this idiot?! 
                That cannot happen!  This is college football, not the ultimate 
               fighting championship!  What we have here is too much muscle 
               and not  enough brain mass -- this is why we need a life-time 
               ban!  Make an example out of him!  Because the sport deserves 
               better than this!  Talk to me! 
 
               CAMERA PUSHES IN -- ECU on the TV as we hear --

                                     BRANDON VOICEOVER
               It made all the highlight films.  People wrote editorials.  Overnight 
               I became the poster boy for the "Dark Side of Sports." 
 
               The college yanked my scholarship and I was kicked out of school. 
                The ref piled on, pressed charges.  My probation included counseling.
 
               

               INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY


               A PSYCHIATRIST faces BRANDON.  A clock ticks in the corner.
 
               
                                     PSYCHIATRIST
               Who did the referee represent, Brandon?

                                     BRANDON
               He represented the nearest guy I could grab.

                                     PSYCHIATRIST
               ... Let's try again.


               INT. WINDOWLESS OFFICE - PRESENT DAY - DAY


               CAMERA moves ceiling level above a dreary space.  Passing over 
               cramped cubicles.  Murmer of voices from each one.  EMPLOYEES 
               seen, all reading phone copy into taping devices.  Sex lines, 
               astrology and get-rich-quick schemes are heard.  
 
                                     BRANDON VOICEOVER
               Football wasn't a sport, it was my life.  Maybe I couldn't play 
               anymore but I couldn't leave.  So I went with it, 
 
               rode it out.  Then one day, and it didn't

               take long, I woke up at the bottom, and I liked it so much, I 
               stayed for six years.
 
               THE CAMERA stops above BRANDON.  Older.  Scruffier.  He sits 
               in his cubicle under a flickering flourescent light, tossing 
               a weathered football as he reads copy into a recording device.

               fan trivia to win a VIP Gold Package back stage pass to Jessica's 
               Omnicon Hotels Summer Tour--
 
               A bull-like BOSS appears at BRANDON'S cubicle entry -- 

                                     BOSS
               Got a job for you, Lang.

                                     BRANDON
               I'm in the middle of taping.

                                     BOSS
               Bauer's sick, can't update his betting line.  You know anything 
               'bout sports?
 
                                     BRANDON
               ... Yeah, a little.


               INT. NEIGHBORING CUBICLE - OFFICE - MINUTE LATER


               BRANDON enters a co-worker's cluttered cubicle. 

                                     BRANDON VOICEOVER
               900 numbers, audio text, the racket had a lot of names.      
                 
 
               Brandon sits at his co-worker's desk.  He picks up the text copy 
               sitting beside the recording device, looks it over -- 
 
                                     BRANDON VOICEOVER
               This guy's gig was sports handicapping.  Predicting winners for 
               people who bet.  I was supposed to just record his picks.
 
               The thing was, I didn't agree with them.  

               Brandon starts changing game selections, re-writing the copy. 
                
 
                                     BRANDON VOICEOVER
               My picks went 9-and-1 that weekend.  By football season, the 
               job was mine...
 

               INT. BRANDON'S NEW CUBICLE - SEVERAL MONTHS LATER - DAY


               A football is seen, rising and falling from BRANDON'S cubicle. 
                He tosses the football as he records a new update --
 
                                     BRANDON
               --Kansas City is 7-1 against the point spread versus division 
               opponents coming off a Monday night game.  Take K.C. minus the 
               six points.  Call tomorrow for my pro football game of the year 
               -- Tampa Bay versus Oakland.  That's 900-656-3100.  This is Brandon 
               Lang saying good night and good luck everybody.
 
               BRANDON pops the tape.  Dons an old UNLV windbreaker.  He shoulders 
               a beat-up bike, walks up front, hands the tape to his BOSS.  
               BOSS hands back a paycheck.  Regarding the amount --
 
                                     BRANDON
               I went 9-2 in pro football Sunday and hit my third straight Monday 
               night parlay. 
 
                                     BOSS
               That's what you get paid for.

                                     BRANDON
               I want a raise to 12 bucks an hour.

                                     BOSS
               I don't make 12 an hour.

                                     BRANDON
               You're not picking 75 percent.

               me a postcard

               BRANDON rides a beat-up bike through downtown.


               INT. CASINO - DAY


               BRANDON maneuvers through a bustling casino, enters the SPORTS 
               BETTING ROOM.  He goes to a rack of printed bettling lines for 
               the weekend games, pockets a printed sheet, sees a SUPERVISOR.
 
               
                                     BRANDON
               Hey Stu, where's the action this weekend?

                                     SUPERVISOR/STU
               We're getting big money on Tampa/Oakland.  Everyone's jumping 
               on Tampa Bay.  
 
                                     BRANDON
               Crazy.

               Supervisor/stu

               You think?

                                     BRANDON
               That game's gonna be won by coaching, Stu.  Gruden put that Tampa 
               Bay team together before he came to Oakland, right?  He knows 
               every weakness of that team and every strength.  He knows Brown 
               only likes to catch over his left shoulder and he'll have him 
               double-teamed to the right.  He knows Gannon always throws on 
               a 3-step drop and the linebackers will take away the middle of 
               the field.  Gannon'll be intercepted at least 4 times on Sunday. 
               
 
               (STU staring at him, pained look)

               ...You got sucked into Tampa, didn't you?

               (STU manages a nod)

               Stu, how many times do I have to bail you out?  All right, listen, 
               forget the point spread.  Oakland's going to win outright.  Bet 
               the money line and bet big.
 
                                     STU
               Thanks, B.

               EXT. BRANDON'S HOUSE - NIGHT


               BRANDON rides up.  His younger brother, DENNY (18, Metallica 
               t-shirt) and some FRIENDS work on an old, bondo-pocked muscle 
               car in the garage.  
 
                                     DENNY
               I scrounged some old headers, B!  Check it out!

               DENNY turns the key.  The car rumbles to life.  He revs the bored-out 
               engine, flashes a shit eating grin.
 
                                     BRANDON
               ... Awesome dude.  That's a righteous ride, Denny.


               INT. BRANDON'S HOUSE - NIGHT


               MOM'S readying for work, dressed in croupier attire, searching 
               for something as BRANDON enters.
 
                                     MOM
               I'm late.  Dinner's in the oven.

               Where the hell's my lucky crucifix?

               BRANDON reaches to a key rack, hands it to her.  She dons it.
 
               
                                     MOM
               Thank God.  A man won 5600 at my table last night.  Tipped me 
               out in color.  I gave it to Denny, help him with college.
 
               BRANDON nods, downs a carton of milk.  MOM about to go.

                                     MOM
               Mail came, letter for you, from Chicago.  

               You just tried out last week.  They got back to you quick.  That's 
               a good sign.
 
                                     BRANDON
               Wanna bet?

                                     MOM
               Open it.

               BRANDON opens it.  Reads.  Words pop out: "Arena Football League"..."We 
               regret to inform you"..."but based on your performance"..."staff 
               declines."  
 
                                     BRANDON
               At least they kicked me a cap.

                                     MOM
               Shit.


               INT. BRANDON'S ROOM - NIGHT


               Filled with exercise equipment.  BRANDON pins the letter to a 
               wall covered by dozens of rejections -- National Football League 
               -- Canadian Football League -- Arena Football League. BRANDON 
               changes into shorts.  And now we see, he's in amazing shape. 
                Could maybe still play pro.  But that two foot scar running 
               the length of his leg makes you wonder.  As BRANDON pumps it 
               out we realize he still has a dream of coming back, a dream we 
               sense by his intensity is fast slipping away and --

               BRANDON pedals to work when his cell phone rings.  Answering:

               This is Walter Abrams.  I don't know if you know me but I run 
               the biggest sports service in the country.  Hell, I started the 
               industry.  Ask around.  Ask anyone, 
 
               even that reprobate boss of yours.  It's

               my job to keep track of who's doing what and what you're doing 
               should be rewarded.
 
               Focus, Brandon.  Focus.  One day you'll 

               look back, see this was one of life's defining moments.  Allow 
               me to paint a picture for you.  Right now I'm getting a massage, 
               looking out my window at the greatest city in the world and all 
               I'm asking you to do is come up with a number.  Write down what 
               you make now, cross it out and write what you should be making 
               and then toss in how much it'll take to get you to fly here first 
               class and come work for me -- did I mention free room and board 
               -- and speak up when you've got something to share.
 
               (aside to MASSEUSE)

               Right there.  Yeah.  Deeper.  Yes.  Fuck that hurts.

               INT. BRANDON'S CUBICLE DAY


               BRANDON hefts the bike down the hall, reaches his cubicle to 
               find his phone ringing.  Picking up --

               It's me again.  

                                     BRANDON
               This is a joke, right?

               A joke can be the ultimate intellectual pursuit sometimes.  This? 
                This is just a job offer.  In your top drawer there's an envelope 
               with your name on it.  
 
               BRANDON opens the drawer, pulls an envelope and a ticket.

                                     WALTER VO
               That's travel cash and an airline ticket.  It's not a magic trick, 
               Brandon.  I paid someone to put it there, who incidentally
 
               
               said the place reminded him of a Turkish prison.  I don't have 
               to tell you you're 
 
               wasting your time there, Brandon, unless

               this is a part time gig -- unless you're

               planning some kinda "comeback," in which

               case I request you use a fraction of your 

               talents and weigh the odds of that dream becoming reality.  Two 
               leg fractures?  Passed on by every conceivable team in the league? 
                Any chump can make that call, and anyone who clears the boards 
               the way you do week in and week out should live in a penthouse 
               on Park Avenue -- which is not for you to construe I'm offering 
               that to start, but keep these stats up working for me and I'll 
               have you in one in less than a year.  Unless of course you're 
               a village kind of guy...
 
               BRANDON glances at the old faded football in his back pack.
 
               
                                     WALTER VO
               Run the numbers, do the math.  Hold on a sec--

               Muzak.  BRANDON juggles the phone, searching, finds a pay stub. 
                Amount: $275.00 a week.  BRANDON crosses it out, writes $1000. 
                He crosses that out, writes $1500.  BRANDON pulls a quarter, 
               flips it.  The coin bounces, spins, falls and--
 

               EXT. JFK MOVING WALKWAY - DAY


               BRANDON hefts a duffel bag -- sees an ASIAN DRIVER, chauffeur 
               uniform, mirrored shades, holding a sign reading B. LANG and 
               --
 

               INT. MOVING LIMO - DAY


               BRANDON eyes a basket of croissants and juice, grabs a danish, 
               takes a bite, sees the DRIVER watching in the mirror.
 
                                     BRANDON
               I'm gonna pay.  I'll pay you--

                                     DRIVER
               --Pay me?  Pay Walter.  His car.  I'm Milton, I drive for him.
 
               
                                     BRANDON
               I thought it was a service.

               (moving to the jump seat, seeing MILTON is driving very fast)
 
               
               So what's the deal with this guy?  You work for him a long time?
 
               
                                     MILTON
               Oh yeah, going on two weeks.

               (off BRANDON'S look)

               I was bike messenger.  Walter's driver hit me with his car.  
               I lie on ground, make it look worse than is, big car, you
 
               know maybe get some money.  Driver call me name, I call him name, 
               he take swing -- big son of a bitch -- so I kick his ass.
 
               (slicing the air with his hands)

               Walter get out.  I say his driver can't drive, he say you're 
               right.  I say damn right.  He ask if I can, I say hell yeah. 
                He take hat off driver, give it to me.
 
               Every day with Walter is...


               EXT. BROOKLYN HEIGHTS BROWNSTONE - DAY


               Five stories.  Next to the Brooklyn Bridge.  Manhattan rises 
               across the East River.  The limo pulls up.  BRANDON steps out, 
               regards the structure.  Exhaust fans dot the second floor.  Satellite 
               dishes on the roof.  Security cameras everywhere. 
 

               INT. BROWNSTONE - TOP FLOOR - DAY


               BRANDON follows MILTON through a large, wildly furnished apartment. 
                They pass an large library dominated by rows of bleacher seats 
               from the old Polo Grounds.  A hot dog stand sits outside a wine 
               cellar.  Toys tell us there's a child in the house.  A cha-cha 
               plays from a stereo.  MILTON stops at a set of doors.  About 
               to knock when --
 
                                    WALTER VO

               Bring him in!


               INT. WALTER ABRAMS' OFFICE - DAY


               WALTER smokes a cigarette, talking on the phone as an ASSISTANT 
               in a separate, adjoining space handles four ringing phones.  
               Across the room, a large wall is filled with TVS, each turned 
               to a different channel, no sound. 
 
                                     WALTER
               I'll hire the trainers too... Well run it by them, you won't 
               know until you try... So, they can stay the night.  I'll put 
               'em up at the Plaza, nice suite, park view... Okay double it... 
               Triple it... Everything's about money.  Look, on Sunday, my daughter, 
               an angel, turns six, it's not likely to happen again.  She
 
               
               loves elephants.  Your circus has 10,

               I only want one, my little girl's happiness is in your hands.
 
               
               (beat, icy edge)

               I don't need parenting advice from a guy 

               who doubles as a clown.  I want an

               elephant and I'll pay.  What'll it take to grease your wheels 
               and get one this weekend?  Hello?... Hello?"  Fuck wad!
 
               (intercom his ASSISTANT, furious)

               Find Ringling Brothers!  Get me on the horn with someone who 
               understands profit!
 
               WALTER sees BRANDON.  Something new.  Full focus.  He removes 
               the headset.  Dons his glasses.  Circles around.  
 
                                     WALTER
               Whoa, look at you.  The Marlboro man.

               (feeling his bicep)

               Jesus you're in great shape.

                                     BRANDON
               I've been in better.

                                     WALTER
               (assessing BRANDON as he speaks--)

               Modesty's not a virtue, it's a vice, as evil as vanity.  There 
               are rules to
 
               success, Brandon, and this is rule number one, know what you 
               know and know what you don't know and know I gotta know  everything 
               you know as soon as you know it, if not sooner!  Smile.  C'mon! 
                What the hell is that?  I said smile.  Bigger.  Hungrier.  More 
               teeth.  Ever sell before?  
 
                                     BRANDON
               No.

                                     WALTER
               If you can sell you'll never starve.  Ever speak in public?  
               Perform?  Anything like that?
 
                                     BRANDON
               I played quarterback in college.  Division one. 

                                     WALTER
               I know, I'm talking about not in uniform.

                                     BRANDON
               I used to sing at church.

                                     WALTER
               Oh really?  So you're religious?  

                                     BRANDON
               I don't know.  I guess.  

                                     WALTER
               Certain things, you either are or you aren't.  Which is it?
 
               
                                     BRANDON
               When I was a kid I thought I wanted to be a pastor... obviously 
               not now.  I mean, yeah, I believe in God.
 
                                     WALTER
               Relax.  What do I care?  Besides, it's against the law to hire 
               based on religious orientation.  You're not a republican are 
               you?  Just kidding.
 
               (silent beat, staring at him)

               You're scaring me son.  What's with the deer-caught-in-headlights 
               vibe?  You were a quarterback for God's sake.  A leader.
 
                                     BRANDON
               That was six years ago.

                                     WALTER
               C'mon, you won three conference titles at a major university. 
                You think I went to college?  I'm autodidactic.  Big word, huh? 
                Know what it means?  Self-taught.  Partially by reading, sure, 
               but mostly by keeping my eyes open and asking a lot of stupid 
               fucking questions.  I swear to God I'm looking at myself 30 years 
               ago.  A taller, more athletic version maybe, but the resemblance 
               is remarkable.
 
               WALTER crushes out the cigarette, sprays air freshener.

                                     WALTER
               I'm not supposed to smoke any more, among other things.  It's 
               bad for my condition.  So before I die, did you do anything other 
               than the sports phone in Vegas?  
 
                                     BRANDON
               Just the 900 number recordings, it was full time, I mean we got 
               10 bucks a call.
 
                                     WALTER
               Chump change, Brandon.  We're angling for bigger fish here.  
               You see, the networks don't talk about it and Uncle Sam can't 
               tax it, but sports gambling is a 200-billion-dollar-a-year-business. 
                These gamblers have needs, Brandon.  Come Monday morning, after 
               a losing weekend, a lot of them have big needs.   
 
               WALTER presses a button and the TVS fill with football games. 
               
 
                                     WALTER
               That's every pro game played last Sunday.

               Do you know why Monday Night's the most watched game of the week? 
                It's because Monday's the last chance bettors have to climb 
               out of the hole before paying their bookies on Tuesday.  Sports 
               betting's illegal in 49 states, including this one, but what 
               we do is 100% legal -- it's exactly the same as a stock broker, 
               only instead of touting stocks, we advise people on how to bet. 
                We make the big money off our client list.  You see, when a 
               client wins with our advice we take a percentage, which they 
               gladly give to keep getting our picks.  When they lose we get 
               zip.  So the object here, my tall, athletic, religious friend 
               -- is to win.
 
               WALTER clicks a control and his face fills the wall of tvs.  
               Phone numbers and messages ("FOOTBALL SELECTIONS!" COLLEGE AND 
               PRO!"  "BASKETBALL PICKS!") flash on the screens.  It's a high-octane 
               infomercial for sports gamblers.

               My cable show.  Tapes Thursday, airs Saturday and Sunday morning. 
                Nationwide.  Hell I need a new barber.  The man should 
 
               be shot.  Look at my hair in the back.

                                     BRANDON
               How'd you afford that yacht if the picks are free?

                                     WALTER
               There is no yacht.  Good, keep asking question.  Next.

                                     BRANDON
               You didn't answer about the free picks.

                                     WALTER
               I know.  What else?

                                     BRANDON
               What's on the second floor?

                                     WALTER
               That's where we print the money.  Any more?

                                     BRANDON
               No, that clears up pretty much everything.

                                     WALTER
               Great.  Welcome aboard.  We got some good stuff to work with.

               Ever have a manicure?

                                     BRANDON
               Me?  No.  Why?

                                     WALTER
               Because you need one.  Besides, there's  a girl you gotta meet.
 
               
                                     BRANDON
               Really?  What's she like?

               INT. HIGH-END, BROOKLYN SALON - DAY


               TONI MORROW looks into CAMERA, styles an attractive, 30-ish WOMAN'S 
               hair as the WOMAN regards her face in a mirror --
 
               woman

               I'm just thinking of doing some work around the eyes.  Tighten 
               it up a bit.  A lift here, look, see these lines?
 
                                     TONI
               I see a beautiful woman.  What are you --all of 35?  I have a 
               girlfriend, she was stunning, went in to "tighten it up a bit" 
               and came out with a permanent smile.  Even when she cries she 
               looks like she's laughing.  Another, she's on her third eye lift. 
                Her skin's so tight, I swear, if you put an egg shell on her 
               butt she'd look like a baby bird.
 
                                     WOMAN
               I'm just thinking of a tune-up.

                                     TONI
               Oh yeah, first it's a tune-up, then it's something else, and 
               one day you'll come teetering in with your new 36Cs and a stretched 
               face and you won't be able to say how unhappy you are because 
               of all the collagen they shot in your lips.  
 
               Do youself a favor.  Skip the surgery and get a shrink, work 
               on the inside.
 
                                     WOMAN
               Easy for you to say.  You used to model.

               The other WOMEN CUSTOMERS listening nearby nod in agreement.

               Oh yeah, that's true.  Those were the good days.  Sometimes I 
               like to just curl up on the ledge with my box of retouched photos 
               and reminisce about rehab.
 
                                     WOMAN
               Tightly wound today, aren't we?

                                     TONI
               I guess.  Must be the coffee talking.  

               (handing her a fashion magazine)

               Here, read a fashion magazine.  Feel more insecure about yourself.
 
               
               TONI walks through the shop, checks her watch, passes a row of 
               WOMEN getting lunch-hour nail jobs.  BRANDON'S squeezed in among 
               them.  Only guy there.  Cotton between his toes post-pedicure. 
                Hunched and uncomfortable as the WOMEN around him discuss boyfriends 
               and relationships.

               ... Brandon?

                                     BRANDON
               Hi.

                                     TONI
               I'm Toni.  Walter said you'd stop by.

                                     BRANDON
               Nice to meet you.

               (immediately, re: the pedicure)

               This was his idea.

                                     TONI
               I know. 

                                     BRANDON
               He makes all his employees do this?

                                     TONI
               Every one.

                                     BRANDON
               How often?

                                     TONI
               Once.  Before they start work.

                                     BRANDON
               Weird.  

                                     TONI
               You think?

                                     BRANDON
               I've never had my nails done before.

                                     TONI
               I can see that.

               (putting his hands in water)

               Strong hands.  Nice.  Do you drink?

                                     BRANDON
               No thanks.  I'm fine.

                                     TONI
               No, do you drink?

                                     BRANDON
               Excuse me?

                                     TONI
               Alcohol.  Are you a drinker?

                                     BRANDON
               I've been pretty focused on staying in shape.  I mean a beer 
               once in a while.
 
                                     TONI
               Smoke?

                                     BRANDON
               No.

               Toni

               What about gambling?

                                     BRANDON
               What about it?

                                     TONI
               Look, I'm sorry, I'm pressed for time.

               (stopping work, regarding him)

               I asked do you bet.  Are you a bettor?

                                     BRANDON
               No.

                                     TONI
               Really?  Why not?

               BRANDON meets her gaze.  Gears turning.  She's hitting on him.
 
               
                                     BRANDON
               Toni, huh?  Are you here full-time?  

                                     TONI
               It's my shop, I better be.  Why don't you gamble?

                                     BRANDON
               Well I'll tell you, Toni.  I bet on something once.  Risked everything 
               I had and lost.
 
                                     TONI
               So?

                                     BRANDON
               I swore I'd never do it again.

               Toni

               You're sticking to that story?

               Brandon 

               Hey, we just met.  I sure wouldn't want to start our relationship 
               off by lying.
 
                                     TONI
               Well Walter could definitely use someone with a little resolve 
               in his life.
 
                                     BRANDON
               (leaning in)

               Ya know, Toni, this is my first time in town.  I'm not used to 
               how fast things run around here.  I'm wondering if you'd  like 
               to have dinner tonight?  Let's get 
 
               to know each other without so many people around.

                                     TONI
               ... He didn't tell you.

                                     BRANDON
               What?

                                     TONI
               Brandon, Walter and I are married.

                                     BRANDON
               What?  Walter just said I was meeting a woman.  He acted like...
 
               
                                     TONI
               Walter's got a weird sense of humor.

               Look, he has a big, bright, beautiful spirit, you'll love working 
               for him, but he's held together by meetings.  If it has "anonymous" 
               at the end, Walter goes.  He has to.  He also has to be very 
               careful who he let's into his life.  In  most ways, Walter's 
               brilliant -- but he can be bullshitted and I can't.  So he sends 
               'em over to me before he hires 'em.  
 
                                     BRANDON
               You're kidding me?  Coming here... the manicure... this was an 
               interview?  
 
                                     TONI
               You're swift.

                                     BRANDON
               How'd I do?

                                     TONI
               Except for an illegal forward pass, 

               perfect, flying colors.  Congratulations.  I'm late for my next 
               appointment.

               900 number office.  A phone and a computer on an empty desk. 
                Two TVs mounted on the wall.  WALTER shows BRANDON around.
 
               
                                     WALTER
               I'm starting you on the 900 numbers, same gig you did in Vegas. 
                You'll make your picks and record them every day, once a day 
               Monday through Friday and five times a day on weekends.  Each 
               call's worth 25 bucks a shot.  Right now we get a few dozen hits 
               a week.  We should be doing triple that.  I'm sending down some 
               test copy.  Before you record it, a little advice.

               just gotta bust you out.

               How?

                                     WALTER
               From now on you have a new name -- John Anthony, "The Million

                                     WALTER
               Brandon Lang is still at home with his mother.  You're selling 
               a lifestyle here, and John's livin' large.  John's got a direct 
               line to God and for a measly 25 bucks a call you're gonna let 
               the world's losers listen in.

               What's your sales pitch? 

                                     BRANDON

               What is that shit?  You spent 6 years bouncing from one dead-end 
               job to another.  Riding to work on a frigging bicycle.  Were 
               you making some kind of statement?  What the hell were you afraid 
               of?  
 
                                     BRANDON

               to get back in the game.

                                     BRANDON
               C'mon!  First too little, then too much --

                                     WALTER
               It's a start. 

                                     BRANDON
               Tell me what you want.

                                     WALTER
               No.  What do you want, Brandon?  That's what this is about!
 
               
               WALTER stops.  Steadies himself.  He pulls a prescription vial. 
                Sits.  Passing, pained look.
 
                                     BRANDON
               Walter?  Are you okay? 

                                     WALTER
               ... Huh?... It's nothing. 

               (popping a pill from the vial, beat, taking another)

               ... Small one.

                                     BRANDON
               Should I call someone?

                                     WALTER
               Not unless they got a spare heart.  I'm okay.

               WALTER finds a cigarette.  Lights it.  Savors the first drag.
 
               
                                     BRANDON
               What are you doing?

                                     WALTER
               Courage wants to laugh.


               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - MORNING


               BRANDON riding his bike hard across the Brooklyn Bridge.   Wearing 
               earphones while he listens to a radio sports show.
 
               RADIO ANNOUNCER/keith jackson vO

               --Talking about college defenses you have to include Oklahoma. 
                The Okie boys are 2nd-ranked going into this weekend and facing 
               an offensive powerhouse in Oregon. 
 
               That game and more coming up after the break. 

               A commerical's heard as BRANDON pedals away, glances up and --surreal 
               sight -- Brandon hurtling at an ELEPHANT'S ASS -- he swerves 
               -- looks back at the TRAINER walking the pachyderm across the 
               city span and -- 
 

               INT. BRANDON'S APARTMENT - DAY


               A TV SCREEN FILLS FRAME.  A COLLEGE FOOTBALL GAME starts. ANNOUNCERS 
               riff a MEDLEY of analysis and scores.
 
               PULL BACK TO SHOW -- BRANDON comes out of the shower, towel around 
               his waist, putting on a clean shirt.  Through a ground floor 
               window the boardwalk can be seen.  A child's party is in progress. 
                The elephant ambles by wearing a birthday hat, the bemused TRAINER 
               walking beside him.  TONI and WALTER are seen arm-in-arm with 
               their 6-year-old daughter, JULIA.  WALTER crosses the lawn, looks 
               through the window.
 
               BRANDON'S switching between football games blaring from the tv. 
                A radio blasts scores and updates.  WALTER knocks on the window, 
               mouths "How we doing?"  BRANDON grabs a betting sheet, writes 
               something, holds it up -- 0 and 9.  WALTER scowls.  BRANDON realizes 
               it's upside down, flips it to read -- 6 and 0.  WALTER kisses 
               the glass and --
 

               EXT. BROWNSTONE - SAME TIME - DAY


               WALTER catches up to TONI, walks through the party with her.
 
               
                                     WALTER
               He's a machine, all he does is work out and pick winners.  Talk 
               about fit.  Go  take a peek, see him with his shirt off.  I did. 
                He's a serious side of beef. 
 
                                     TONI
               Enjoy your daughter's party.

                                     WALTER
               Check him out, you know you want to.  

                                     TONI
               Get out of your head, Walter.  It's a bad neighborhood.

               TONI kisses him, walks with WALTER through the party and --
 
               

               EXT. BROWNSTONE ROOF - DUSK


               Satellite dishes aim at the sky.  ANNOUNCER CHATTER continues 
               OVER, giving non-stop COLLEGE football scores.  BRANDON comes 
               down the street, carries a bag of take-out.  
 
               BRANDON'S POV -- a second floor window opens as someone blows 
               cigarette smoke into the night.  Activity seen inside before 
               the window shuts.  BRANDON left staring and --
 

               EXT. PARK SLOPE - NIGHT


               BRANDON rides a bike.  Wears headphones.  Sunday's NFL scores 
               coming in now.  BRANDON'S reactions indicate he's doing well.
 
               

               INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - NIGHT


               WALTER writing on a call sheet -- 375 calls at $25/85 at $50!" 
               The city's seen through WALTER'S office window.  NFL ANNOUNCER 
               CHATTER subsides as scores filter in.  WALTER flipping through 
               BRANDON'S betting sheets, smile spreading over his face and --
 
               

               INT. N.Y.C. RESTAURANT - NIGHT


               Loud.  Crowded.  High-end.  WALTER, TONI and BRANDON at a table, 
               ordering dinner.  
 
                                     BRANDON
               I'll have the bruketta and the -- this, with the pasta.

                                     WAITER
               (takes the menus, departs)

               Very good, and may I say, sir, an excellent choice.

                                     WALTER
               It's bruchetta.  Like little pizzas without the cheese.

                                     BRANDON
               Bruchetta.

                                     WALTER
               Don't worry about it.  Anyone goes 20 for 24 in college football, 
               12 for 14 pro can call it whatever he wants.  Ever drink a thousand 
               dollar bottle of wine?  Steward!
 
                                     TONI
               It's a waste, Walter.  He hardly drinks. 

                                     WALTER
               It's a celebration.  Just because he's out with a couple of reformed 
               drunks doesn't mean he can't enjoy himself.
 
                                     TONI
               I was a lot of things, Walter, but I was never a drunk.

                                     BRANDON
               Actually, truth be told, I've never had a 12 dollar bottle of 
               water either.
 
                                     WALTER
               He thinks we're fighting.

                                     BRANDON
               No.  I just, this place is great.

                                     TONI
               --Watch out, Walter, he's a fixer.

                                     WALTER
               175 calls on the 900 number.

                                     TONI
               Did you call home?  Let 'em know how you did?  How you're doing?
 
               
                                     BRANDON
               I will tomorrow.  My mom works nights at the casino, she'll sleep 
               till three.
 
                                     TONI
               Are you close with your parents?

                                     WALTER
               He's very close.  They sound terrific.  

                                     TONI
               Is your name Brandon?

                                     BRANDON
               Oh, they're great.  We talk all the time.

                                     TONI
               What're they like?

                                     BRANDON
               Mom's terrific.  Amazing lady.  I got a little brother, Denny, 
               going to college next year.  Complete motor head.  Dad's a... 
               well he's a sports nut.  He was, I mean, it all came from that.
 
               
                                     WALTER
               Kid grew up with the frigging Cleavers...


               INT. RESTAURANT - LATER


               WALTER, TONI and BRANDON finish dessert.

                                     WALTER
               I should've ordered two.  

                                     TONI
               What'd the doctor say, Walter?

                                     WALTER
               Oh yeah, I've been meaning to tell you.  I had a check-up yesterday. 
                Afterwards 
 
               he was very concerned.  He sat me down, looked me in the eye 
               and said, "Walter, who do you like in the Buffalo/Oakland game?"
 
               
               WALTER laughs.  He reaches to Toni's plate, lifts a dessert pitcher.
 
               
                                     WALTER
               You didn't touch the sauce.

                                     TONI
               Neither should you, Walter.

                                     WALTER
               I read chocolate's good for you. 

                                     TONI
               I'm not raising a kid alone.

                                     WALTER
               Don't get dramatic, Toni.  In biblical times you'd just move 
               in with my brother Morty.
 
               TONI shoots him a look and WALTER quickly sets down the sauce.
 
               
                                     WALTER
               --Wow.  What a meal.  Do you feel good, Brandon?  Content?

                                     BRANDON
               Very.

                                     WALTER
               Yeah, I can tell.  Don't be.  Ever.  One week's over, another 
               begins.  The past is merely a prologue.  In this job you have 
               to push the envelope every day.  
 
               BRANDON glances at a nearby table, catches the eye of a stunning 
               GIRL sandwiched between two middle-aged, overweight MEN.  WALTER 
               catches the eye contact before she looks away.  The GIRL seems 
               bored as the two big men heartily chow down.
 
                                     WALTER
               Look at that.  Beauty and the beasts.  What do you think of her, 
               Brandon?    
 
                                     BRANDON
               She's cute.

                                     WALTER
               Cute doesn't half cover it.  The girl's gorgeous.  And bored 
               out of her mind.  Waiting for some young buck to save her from 
               those two gorillas.  Check it out.  She's eyeing you again, Brandon.
 
               
                                     BRANDON
               So are the two guys she's with.

                                     WALTER
               I'll bet you 10-to-1 on a 1000 you can't pick her up, cash, if 
               you leave with her.
 
               Toni

               C'mon Walter.  You might as well go to Atlantic City and open 
               a house account.  You know you can't gamble.      
 
                                     WALTER
               Who's gambling?  It's a challenge.  If Brandon leaves with her 
               I give him ten thousand dollars, that's probably more than he 
               made last year.  If not, he gives me a grand, which I'll give 
               to you. 
 
                                     BRANDON
               I don't bet, Walter.

               (glancing over, look from the GIRL)

               ... But I do love a challenge.  

                                     WALTER
               All right.  Before you bust a move, just one thing...

               (talks across the table, addressing the MODEL and the two MEN)
 
               
               Excuse me, I don't mean to interrupt but 

                                     
               Walter con'd

               I have to know what's going on here.

               You're drop dead gorgeous and your dates

               look like they haven't missed a meal

               since Christ died.  Seriously, you

               two are eating like you have a date 

               with the electric chair.  What's the story with you three?  I'm 
               not gonna sleep if I don't know.  Lemme guess.  Garment district. 
                The Hardy boys make lingerie and you're a model.  That
 
               it?  Close?  Sprechenzee English?  Sit down, sit down -- I'm 
               just joking.  I better stop before I get stabbed with a fork. 
                Bon apetit.
 
               (turning back, TONI staring at him)

                                     TONI
               What the hell was that?

                                     WALTER
               I'll send over a bottle of champagne.  

               Toni

               You'll pick up their check.

                                     WALTER
               The voice of reason.  She's right.  I owe 'em a meal.  Hey -- 
               here we go, Brandon, your girlfriend's going to the bathroom. 
                
 
               The GIRL glides by their table.  Heads up a flight of stairs.
 
               
                                     WALTER
               Well get moving, slick.

               Brandon 

               After that introduction? 

                                     WALTER
               Hey, I just raised the bar.  C'mon, kid.  John Anthony could 
               close her.
 
               Beat.  BRANDON looks from WALTER to TONI.

                                     TONI
               I'd prefer Brandon...

               BRANDON smiles.  He walks through the restaurant, up the stairs 
               as the WOMEN'S ROOM door opens and the GIRL emerges before him. 
                She regards BRANDON.  Jaded, disintested air. 
 
                                     BRANDON
               You're beautiful.

                                     GIRL
               (stepping past)

               Excuse me.  

                                     BRANDON
               I just want to get to know you.

                                     GIRL
               You just want to get into my pants.

                                     BRANDON
               I want to get into your mind, your heart, your soul.  I don't 
               see you wearing any pants in this equation.  
 
               Beat.  This could go either way before -- the GIRL smiles.

                                     BRANDON
               I'm Brandon.  What's your name?

               GIRl

               Alex.

                                     BRANDON
               Alexandria.  Beautiful name for a beautiful girl.

               BRANDON leans in close, talking too low now for us to hear.  
               Selling hard.  ALEXANDRIA laughs at something he says and --

               WALTER and BRANDON reach the second floor landing, stand outside 
               a solid steel door.
 
                                     WALTER
               Everything you've ever done's been leading up to this moment. 
                Put your ear to the door.  Hear that?  It's the sound of possibilities. 
                The din of greatness.
 
               WALTER turns the knob, BRANDON nearly tumbles through and --
 
               

               INT. BROWNSTONE SECOND FLOOR - DAY


               Another world.  A dozen SALESMEN work in a large room.  Phones 
               ring.  FAXES churn.  Numbers are called out.  A half-dozen GIRLS 
               stroll the space, deliver betting and tip sheets.
 
                                     WALTER
               We use the 800 number and free tips to bait the hook.  Then the 
               bettors are 
 
               bounced to our sales staff.

               (stopping at the front desk, talking to a pretty Brooklyn GIRL) 
               
 
               You're looking lovely today, Tammy.  Give it up baby, you know 
               what I need.
 
               TAMMY smiles, hands WALTER a long list of names and numbers. 
                WALTER studies the sheet as he walks BRANDON through the room.
 
               
                                     WALTER
               This is the day's phone sheet, it's a list of everyone who's 
               called.  Only way to keep track of the action.  All leads equal 
               money. 
 
               BRANDON'S POV -- walking by SALESMEN doing their thing.  The 
               first is a chain smoker, battering ram tone.  This is SOUTHIE.
 
               
               Southie

               Did I not tell you that game was going over the total?  Now stop 
               holding back and let's make some serious dough...
 
               What's our game plan this week?  Look, Mr. Mitch, collect from 
               your bookie, wire our pitiful frigging share and then we'll discuss 
               the goddamn game plan.
 
               The second MAN'S HERBIE.  Slight.  Polite.  Soothing tone.

                                     HERBIE
               Trust me, we're going to turn all this around... I'm aware last 
               weekend was difficult... Well of course I do, that's a substantial 
               sum--
 
               (cupping the phone, to WALTER)

               --He's a bit miffed about our picks

                                     WALTER
               Fuck him if he can't take a joke.

                                     BRANDON
               You're telling me that all this is legal?

                                     WALTER
               It better be.  Five of these guys are off-duty cops.  We're just 
               advising people how to bet, not making the bets for 'em.
 
               C'mon, I want you to hear our best salesman, Reggie Hawks.

                                     REGGIE/INTO PHONE
               --It says here your minimum bet's five grand, so let's be honest 
               now, can you
 
               move 50 large on this game or not?...  I don't have time for 
               this shit, Jimmy.  I
 
               know you're a loser, because if you 

               were such a big winner you wouldn't have paid money to call me 
               today.  Vegas is calling, I'm putting you on hold. 
 
               (pressing hold)

               What's up big Wally, you slummin' today!

               This the new kid?

                                     WALTER
               Brandon Lang, meet Reggie.

                                     REGGIE
               You're the QB that went off on the refs.

               (BRANDON shamefully nods)

               --Yeah, but you covered!  Shit, as much money as the refs cost 
               us every year, that was pure.  Totally crystal.  Hell, I like 
               you already.  Even if you did get the best office.
 
                                     WALTER
               (re: an item on the sports ticker)

               Barker's not playing this weekend?

                                     REGGIE
               Hamstring.

                                     BRANDON
               No, he's in the middle of renegotiating.  It's a tantrum, he'll 
               play Sunday.
 
               WALTER and REGGIE exchange a glance, they can use that and --
 
               
               ANGLE ON -- TWO GLASSED-IN OFFICES overlooking the sales room. 
                  One office is crammed with clutter, bears a prominent KEEP 
               OUT sign on the door.  Inside, a big, bearded MAN wolfs a breakfast 
               burrito, scours the sports pages.  In the other office sits a 
               suited, studious-looking MAN in his 30s, talking on a headset--
 
               

               INT. OFFICE OVERLOOKING SALES ROOM - SAME TIME - DAY


               JERRY SYKES types stats into a computer as he fields a call. 
                 Three other computer screens flash football info and data. 
                Large, complex wall graphs chart esoteric team trends.  A framed 
               promotional picture shows JERRY standing in a bank vault, the 
               banner type below reading "Jerry 'The Source' Sykes, Creator 
               of The Sykes Sports Wagering System."
 
                                     JERRY
               (typing on a computer as he speaks)

               --I know it's a new stadium, I'm asking if they used Astroturf 
               or Astroplay?... Astroplay, it has a rubber silica base, like 
               ground up tires... Look, I don't have time to explain abrasion 
               indexes and resistance scales to you, trust me, it makes a big 
               fucking difference...
 
               (looking through the glass, seeing WALTER showing BRANDON around)
 
               
               So bribe a security guard, sneak in with the grounds crew, do 
               what you have to -- this is what I pay you for.
 

               INT. ENCLOSED OFFICE - SECOND FLOOR - DAY


               WALTER and BRANDON enter.  It's spacious.  Nicely appointed. 
                A glass partition overlooks the sales room.
 
                                     WALTER
               I had three guys who picked games.  I fired one last weekend. 
                I'm giving you his job.  This is your office.  From here  out 
               your picks are going straight to our biggest customers.  How 
               do you like it?
 
                                     BRANDON
               What's not to like?

               JERRY SYKES appears at the door.  Fast glance at BRANDON, attention 
               to WALTER -- 
 
                                     JERRY
               The Miami/New York point spread shifted a half tick up to 10.
 
               
                                     WALTER
               What do you think?

                                     JERRY
               Miami's still a lock.  The win/loss ratios and RPI ratings are 
               off the charts.  I'm keeping it on my sheet.
 
                                     WALTER
               Jerry's our top handicapper, came to me straight out of grad 
               school.  Jerry, meet the new kid in town. 
 
                                     JERRY
               Whoa, phone guy makes good.  Big jump from the 900 numbers.  
               Watch out you don't get a nose bleed.  Just kidding, best of 
               luck, I gotta get back to work.          
 
                                     BRANDON
               Pleasure meeting you.  By the way, Jerry, New York's gonna win 
               straight up.  They always play the fish tight.  Tonight it's 
               foregone, they win outright.
 
                                     JERRY
               Really?  Listen up, stick to college, sonny.  You have to work 
               up to pro ball around here.  Nice try though.  
 
                                     WALTER
               (watching JERRY walk away)

               I got three guys who can handicap and 20 who can sell but I never 
               had one who could do both, not really, not until now.
 
                                     BRANDON
               You mean me?

                                     WALTER
               Not you.  John Anthony.

                                     BRANDON
               John Anthony doesn't exist.

                                     WALTER
               That's a shock 'cause I'm standing in his office and you're sitting 
               in his chair!
 
                                     BRANDON
               Look, making predictions is one thing -- but pushing people to 
               bet, it's not me.
 
                                     WALTER
               Pushing people?  Get real, this country was built on gambling. 
                Look at Wall Street -- one big casino.  The state spends millions 
               hawking the lottery.  If people want to pay for advice on who 
               to bet, who are we to say no?  Stop being selfish, spread the 
               word!  Check your bible, Brandon, tis better to give than receive. 
               
 
                                     BRANDON
               You got a whole room full of salesmen.

                                     WALTER
               Big bettors don't want to talk to a middle man, they want to 
               speak to the guy making the picks -- and you're picking 80 percent 
               winners.   
 
                                     
                                     WALTER CON'D
               What's the matter?  Gonna lose your purity?  C'mon, what do you 
               think selling is?  We're just talking a few well-timed phrases. 
                Let's start with an easy one.  A throw-away.  "I don't want 
               your money, I want your bookie's fucking money?"
 
                                     BRANDON
               I don't want your money --

                                     WALTER
               --Jesus, don't start that shit again.  Sell me.

                                     BRANDON
               I don't want your money, I want your bookie's money!

                                     WALTER
               What happened to the fuck?

                                     BRANDON
               Nothing, I just don't talk like that.

                                     WALTER
               I can't have someone working for me who can't say fuck.

                                     BRANDON
               It's not that I can't.  Why do I have to?

                                     WALTER
               Because there's no other fucking word that can convey the precise 
               feeling and fucking flavor of life's various predicaments and 
               certain concepts the way a well-placed fuck can.  Fuck is your 
               friend.  Fuck can be your best friend.
 
                                     BRANDON
               I'm happy for you and your friend, Walter, but I'm not using 
               it. 
 
                                     WALTER
               Chaucer used it 600 years ago.  It was good enough for him.  
               C'mon--
 
               (calling out to the SALESMEN)

               --this fucking guy has a problem saying fuck!  

               A chorus of "Fuck yous" fill the air.  

                                     WALTER
               C'mon, repeat after me -- fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.  Fuck he, 
               fuck she, fuck me, fuck them, fuck me -- try it.
 
                                     BRANDON
               It's not me.  Let it go. 

                                     WALTER
               Backbone.  Almost as good.  We'll keep working on the other thing... 
               So, you really like New York in tonight's game?
 

               EXT. MANHATTAN - MID-DAY


               Looking down Fifth.  Thousands of heads in a hurry to get somewhere. 
                Here comes BRANDON and WALTER.
 
                                     BRANDON
               Where are we going?

                                     WALTER
               Continue your education. 


               INT. MANHATTAN APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY


               A dozen people fill an upscale living room.  Doorbell.  A well 
               dressed WOMAN answers.  WALTER and BRANDON stand before her.
 
               
                                     WALTER
               We're here for the gambler's anonymous meeting...


               INT. MANHATTAN APARTMENT - DAY


               The GROUP sit in a circle, listen as a BUSINESSMAN, near tears, 
               gives his testimony.
 
                                     BUSINESSMAN
               ...I mean you'd think with two mortgages out, repo guys staking 
               out my car, my job on the line and my wife threatening to leave, 
               you'd think I'd have the goddamn brains to stop, instead of staying 
               in the chase, doubling down, which of course is what I did... 
               I know I'm sick because I keep thinking if I just pulled that 
               game out then I got a lock on the parlay and I'm flush going 
               into Monday night and--
 
               (breaking down, unable to continue)

                                     MEMBER #1
               ... It's a disease, Leon.

                                     MEMBER #2
               Admitting you have a problem is the first

               step.

                                     BUSINESSMAN/LEON
               Then I guess I'm doing pretty good because I got one big fucking 
               problem.
 
               Someone claps.  Everyone joins in.  LEON smiles.  Warm beat. 
                WALTER suddenly stands.  BRANDON watches, concerned.
 
                                     WALTER
               My name's Walter.  I'm new to the group.

               (various "hellos")

               Hi.  I've been going to meetings like this for 18 years.  Once 
               a week, every Friday night, for 18 years.  This, my friends, 
               is my 936th consecutive meeting.
 
               (enthusiastic applause)

               Thank you.  Thanks.  And my hand to God, I haven't been to a 
               track, casino or bet a game that whole time.  Not a cent.
 
               (murmurs of approval)

               I've listened to thousands of sob stories by people like Leon 
               here, and I gotta say, Leon -- if I learned one thing it's that 
               gambling is not your problem. 
 
                                     LEON
               It's not?

                                     WALTER
               Not even close.  You're a lemon.  Like a bad car, there's something 
               inherently defective in you.  And you.  And me!  All of us here 
               -- we're lemons!  Big, juicy, acidic, ice-tea flavoring lemons! 
                We look like everyone else but we're defective because when 
               most people make a bet they want to win, while we, the degenerate 
               gamblers of the world, we're subconsciously playing to lose. 
                All humans like going to the edge of the abyss, but what makes 
               us different is we go all the way and hurl ourselves off into 
               the void!  And we like doing it so much we do it time after time 
               after time!  Me?  I always felt most alive when they were raking 
               away the chips, and every one here knows what I'm talking about. 
                People like us, even when we win, it's just a matter of time 
               before we give it all back.  But when we lose, and I mean the 
               kind of loss that makes your asshole pucker to the size of a 
               decimal point, there's a moment when you're standing there and 
               you've just recreated the worst possible nightmare this side 
               of malignant cancer for the 20th goddamn time and you suddenly 
               realize -- hey, I'm still here, I'm still breathing, I'm still 
               alive!  In order to really live you have to be aware of your 
               own mortality -- and a losing bet of a certain size is one of 
               the best ways 
 
                                     
                                     WALTER CON'D
               I know of getting that feeling.  When you win, you defy death, 
               but when you lose, 
 
               you survive it, and that's remarkable! 

               Us lemons, we fuck shit up on purpose!  We need to constantly 
               remind ourselves
 
               that we're alive!  Gambling's not the problem, Leon, your fucked 
               up need to feel something, to convince yourself you exist, to 
               test what's really real, that's the problem!

               What the fuck was that?!

               ... What'd you just say?

                                     BRANDON
               You heard me!  I said what was that?

                                     WALTER
               No, you said "What the fuck?"  That's what you said.

                                     BRANDON
               So?

                                     WALTER
               That was great!  It was all worth it! Don't you see?  I felt 
               your anger because of that one word!  Well done!  I'm proud of 
               you!  The progress you're making Brandon, I gotta say, it's exhilerating!

               work space, strides to the office coffee machine, pours a quick 
               cup.  BRANDON approaches, extends a hand.
 
                                     BRANDON
               Hey, I stopped by to say hi, I'm Brandon.

                                     BIG MAN
               (averting his gaze, walking past)

               Congratulations.

                                     BRANDON
               I'm picking now with you and Jerry.

               The MAN shuts the door, leaves BRANDON looking at the KEEP OUT 
               sign.  SOUTHIE stops for a coffee, has seen the exchange.

               A MIDDLE EASTERN MAN (ratty t-shirt, beard stubble, sleepless 
               look) stands in the back of a low-end dry cleaners.   
 
                                     AMIR
               Yes, hello.

                                     BRANDON
               Today's your day, Amir!  It's a Pamplona thing, I'm running wild 
               in the streets this weekend!  Starting with the hottest Saturday 
               of my life!  How much can you lay with your bookie?  20 large?
 
               
               Amir

               You crazy?  No way.  I was betting a thousand a game but... Look, 
               I saw an ad.  I was just calling to see--
 
                                     BRANDON
               --Amir, this is my lock of a lifetime!  Texas plus the six points! 
                They win by two touchdowns!
 
               Amir 

               Really?  I like Oklahoma in that game.

                                     BRANDON
               (looks up, sees WALTER watching)

               Oklahoma huh?  Okay... well considering that, I like Texas even 
               more now.
 
               Amir 

               I shouldn't have called.  Thank you for--  

                                     BRANDON
               --Amir, buddy, I'm talking about banging out the biggest win 
               of your life.  
 
               WALTER crosses, whispers to BRANDON.  Into the phone:

                                     BRANDON
               Hold on, I got Vegas on the line.

               (pressing HOLD)

                                     WALTER
               There's only one thing you have to know about any of our clients 
               -- they're all in the hole.  The second they pick up the phone, 
               wham!  Right to the point!  You're above them!  Let 'em feel 
               it!  More confidence!  More John Anthony!
 
               (punches speaker phone)

               BRANDON/into phone

               Amir, what's your favorite drink?

                                     AMIR
               Favorite drink?  I dunno, Pina Colada.

                                     BRANDON
               Tomorrow we gotta get you a new drink.  But for now, this is 
               what you're gonna do.  First, you're going to bet 20 large on 
               Texas, then you're going to put on a 
 
               Hawaiian shirt, whip up your sweet little rum concoction with 
               the orange slice and 
 
               the cherry, turn on the game and play

               with the little umbrella while you sit 

               back and watch Texas tear those Okies a

               new asshole -- and when you call me back 

               after winning 20 G's the first thing out out of your mouth will 
               be words every fratboy knows -- "Thank you, sir, may I have another!"
 
               
                                     AMIR
               ... What about payment?

                                     BRANDON
               Good question.  What about it?

               Amir 

               Well how much is this going to cost me?

                                     BRANDON
               We take a percentage if WE win, Amir -- not exactly your problem 
               of late, is it?
 
               Amir

               What if I don't pay?

                                     BRANDON
               It's simple, you don't get any more picks.  Comprende?  So make 
               the bet, make the drink and let's roll this into
 
               something big!

               parlay and pays 6-1.  I do appreciate the 40,000 you sent us 
               today, but let me assure you we've only just begun to make serious

               The doctor, thank God, put Walter,on an exercise program.  I 
               want to be there the first time he goes.  Make sure the trainer 
               understands Walter's aversion to consistency.
 
                                     BRANDON
               Aversion to consistency?

                                     TONI
               He's always been that way.

               Well that's consistent.

                                     WALTER
               I've been tracking you since last year.

                                     TONI
               Don't let him steamroll you.

                                     WALTER
               --Can I get the damn thing out?  I want to put John Anthony on 
               tv this week.
 
                                     BRANDON
               That's me.  You mean me.

                                     WALTER
               That's right.  You, John Anthony.  You're one in the same. 
 
               
                                     TONI
               Go on -- get to the good part, Walter.

                                     WALTER
               Hold on.  Before I say another word, understand -- you do this 
               thing, Brandon, and from here out you gotta eat, sleep, shit, 
               breathe, walk, talk and fart John
 
               Anthony.  It's not just a new persona.

               You can't play it.  You gotta live it.  That's how this works. 
                The only way it works.  You have to sell it all the way.
 
                                     TONI
               Think it over, Brandon, don't decide now.

                                     BRANDON
               It sounds like a promotion.

                                     WALTER
               Bet your ass it is.  Five-star.

                                     BRANDON
               --I'm in.

                                     TONI
               Well that's a thoughtful response.  Here I was, worried you'd 
               rush your decision.
 
                                     BRANDON
               It's the only move.  For six years I've been living on Ramen 
               noodles.  For the
 
               first time in a long time I've got something going.  If that 
               means I gotta do a little acting, fine.
 
                                     WALTER
               Living, not acting.  You understand that as of right now Brandon 
               Lang with his fettucini knee and his self-fucking pity is as 
               flat dead as Donald Trump's hair and John "I-can-walk-on-fucking-water" 
               Anthony has taken his place?
 
                                     TONI
               Listen to what he's asking you, Brandon.

                                     WALTER
               She's right.  There's no going back.  I mean that.  This is gonna 
               cost me.  I'm talking about building an empire around you.  Do 
               you understand that?
 
                                     BRANDON
               ... Should I wait a little to create some tension?  Of course 
               I understand, I'm John Fucking Anthony.  I've got the crystal 
               ball...

               BRANDON'S FACE FILLS SCREEN.  Scissors come in, start cutting. 
                TONI begins bringing John Anthony to life.  BRANDON chatting 
               her up in the chair, TONI laughing at something he says and -- 
               
 

               INT. BARNEY'S MEN'S STORE - DAY


               BRANDON (new haircut) stands in private room, modeling a suit. 
                WALTER nearby, looks through racks of clothes with a SALESMAN.
 
               

               INT. MERCEDES DEALERSHIP - DAY


               BRANDON (new haircut, new suit) walks through the showroom as 
               WALTER talks with a DEALER.
 
                                     WALTER
               I need a new car for my friend.

                                     DEALER
               (to BRANDON)

               Do you have any credit?

                                     BRANDON
               No.

                                     DEALER
               Walter, do you trust him?

                                     WALTER
               With my wife naked.

                                     DEALER
               (calling to BRANDON)

               In that case, which one do you want?

               BRANDON comes over, runs his hand over a sleek, silver SL500.
 
               
                                     WALTER
               I think he likes that one.


               EXT. SIXTH AVENUE BAR - DAY


               The silver SL500 pulls to the curb.  License plate reading "900 
               KING."  A pair of $500 shoes emerge.  BRANDON stands on the sidewalk 
               as the DOORMAN comes up, eyes the car.
 
               Doorman

               I'll watch it for you.

               (seeing the license plate)

               What's "900 King?"

                                     BRANDON
               (handing him a card)

               I don't lose.

               BRANDON heads into the bar, meets WALTER and a group of HEAVY 
               HITTERS outside.  John ANTHONY instantly comes alive and --

               You're sweating a lot honey.

               BRANDON nervously regards himself in the mirror.  WALTER sees. 
                
 
                                     WALTER
               You okay?

                                     BRANDON
               I'm scared shitless.

                                     WALTER
               Don't worry about your lines, it's all scripted.  You've been 
               here before, kid, just think of it like a football game.
 
                                     BRANDON
               This is different.

                                     WALTER
               How?

                                     BRANDON
               There's no opponent.

                                     WALTER
               Perfect, then you're a lock to win.

               table, three chairs and a backdrop bearing a sports-themed logo 
               and the words - THE SPORTS ADVISORS.  BRANDON sits between WALTER 
               and JERRY, increasingly nervous as the CAMERAS push close.  CHUCK 
               arrives, loud suit, takes a seat at the end of the table, head 
               down, averting eye contact with everyone.

                                     JERRY
               John Anthony, huh?  All I see's another wannabee in a 1000-dollar 
               suit.  Word to

               Welcome to this week's edition of The Sports Advisors!  America's 
               premier sports information program with myself, Walter Abrams, 
               Jerry Sykes, Chuck Adler  and a truly gifted newcomer to the 
               Sports Advisor panel, a substantial find -- John Anthony!  We're 
               entering week six in pro football!  This is when the cream rises 
               to the top!  This is when things get hot!  It's oven mitt time!

               the Sykes System predicting for this weekend?
 
                                     JERRY
               Walter, my patented computer models tell me we're looking at 
               nothing less than the perfect storm of betting opportunities. 
                But first, last week I cashed in a big-time call on on Chicago 
               as an outright winner over Indianapolis -- making it my 8th straight 
               top selection winner right here on this tv show!  This Sunday 
               I have 5 match-ups I absolutely love, including Miami at New 
               York!  Stats, rankings, records, weather, the Sykes System uses 
               42 proven indexs to eliminate the guesswork from sports wagering. 
                Without my patented, computer-based picks you have a better 
               chance of seeing God knocking on your door with five strippers 
               and a bag of Bolivian cocaine than winning on your own!  Call 
               me for my five games!  Absolutely free -- 800-238-6648!

               Our experts know how to read between the lines, we know how to 
               analyze a point spread, we're not pulling rabbits out of 
 
               a hat here.  Certainly not Chuck Adler --

               (turning to CHUCK)

               Chuck, you'd probably eat that rabbit if you got your hands on 
               it.
 
                                     CHUCK
               (coming suddenly, wildly alive)

               Hell yes -- with a side order of fried bookmaker!!!  I'm the 
               grim reaper of bookmakers!  I've put more bookies out of business 
               than the I.R.S.!  How many gamblers did I bail out last weekend 
               with my game of the year!  Denver, a 10-
 
               point underdog beating Cincinatti by two touchdowns!  A $100 
               bettor made $10,000!

               Holy Christ, I forgot my earplugs.  Take a break before you blow 
               a gasket, we'll get back to you after my hearing returns.  Saturday 
               comes before Sunday and looking at this Saturday's college match-ups 
               is the last but certainly not least member of The Sports Advisors 
               -- John Anthony!
 
                                     BRANDON

               --John Anthony here, the Million Dollar Man with the billion 
               dollar plan!  From Wall Street to Tokyo to Hollywood, all your 
               big money stays and plays with me!
 
               (beat, processing this, suddenly going off the teleprompter script)
 
               
               --Someone wrote some great stuff for me here but the "Million 
               Dollar Man," I dunno, it sounds kinda small somehow.  I mean 
               maybe if you change that M in million to a Z I could get behind 
               it.  They tried all sorts of names, wanted to call me the Magic 
               Man -- but picking 80 percent winners sounds pretty scientific 
               to me.  So let's just call me John.  I was a quarterback.  And 
               every QB knows the key to victory is anticipating -- the ability 
               to see the future and react to it.  That is what I do, that's 
               the truth, and what do they say about the truth, Walter?
 
                                     WALTER
               ... It bites you on the ass?

                                     BRANDON
               Not in my case.  You tell us, Jerry. 

                                     JERRY
               It sets you free?

                                     BRANDON
               That's right, but with me it makes you M-O-N-EE!  I'm picking 
               80 percent, is that 
 
               unbelievable?  Well it used to be.  I know the leagues!  I know 
               the players!  I
 
                                     
                                     BRANDON CON'D
               know the game!  I'm your friend on the field!  Your insider on 
               the outside!  You can't do what I do if you haven't been there! 
                Played at the level I have!  Maybe you'll get lucky -- guess 
               right once in a while -- but these match- ups won't be called 
               consistently by anything other than experience!  Forget trends! 
                Throw out every system you possess!  Keep your friends but toss 
               their opinions out the window!  It's time to change I-would-if-I-could 
               to I-can-and-I-am!  You wanna know who I like -- call that little 
               number at the bottom of your screen!

               Dim darkness.  Silence.  Then someone bumps into something.  
               Muffled curse.  A light goes on.  TONI sits up in bed, sees WALTER 
               fully dressed, across the room, holding his shoes.
 
                                     WALTER
               I'm not here.  Go back to sleep.

               (continues to his dresser, manic)

               What a show!  You should have seen him!  I'm sitting there watching 
               him roll and I swear he made me want to grab a phone and call! 
                I took the sales boys out to Smith and Wo's.  Get 'em primed 
               for the
 
               weekend.  Chuck got drunk, took a swing

               at one of the deer heads on the wall. 

               Just blowing off steam.  I'm gonna hire more guys Monday.  Put 
               in more phones.      Everything's amping up.  It's okay.  There's 
               room.  I'll tear down a
 
               few walls, fit another 10 desks down 

               there easy.  I'm gonna do a whole dot-com thing around him!  
               Oh shit, if I had me when I was his age... I never had a 
 
               protege.  Someone you hand it all down to.  Anything happens 
               to me, he steps in!  Just knowing that, with the thing... I 
 
               
               mean that's just beautiful!

               (changing into workout clothes)

               Just beautiful.

                                     TONI
               What are you doing?

                                     WALTER
               Going for a run.  See the sunrise.  We're doubling volume this 
               week.  And doubling it again after that.  He can pick, he can 
               sell, he's gonna change things around here.  He's the real deal. 
                Knows sports from the inside.  That's how he picks.  Guy like 
               him comes along once in a -- a -- 
 
                                     TONI
               -- 100 years.

                                     WALTER
               Yeah, a lifetime.

                                     TONI
               Walter, come to bed.

                                     WALTER
               Not tired.

                                     TONI
               You're exhausted.

                                     WALTER
               I'm just gonna run the bridge, up Fifth, circle Central Park, 
               be back in no time.
 
                                     TONI
               Get in bed.  Lie down next to me.  Come on.  Come here, Walter. 
                
 
                                     WALTER
               Just a quick once-around.

                                     TONI
               Roll on your stomach for a minute.

                                     WALTER
               Just for a sec.  I've gotta meet the trainer tomorrow.  Told 
               me to run.  Run in place, or from one place to another...
 
               WALTER lays down.  TONI gently massages his back.  She leans 
               in, whispers to him.  We sense she's done this before.
 
                                     TONI
               --I know.  Of course you do.  This is no time to sleep, Walter... 
               Can't sleep now... Just because you're so tired... Completely, 
               totally, utterly exhausted... I'll be here when you get back 
               from your
 
                                     
                                     TONI CON'D
               run... Right beside you... You go on now, baby, I'll stay right 
               here... It's okay... Close your eyes... Just for a second before 
               you leave... I'm not going anywhere... I'll just hold you--
 
               
               (quietly crying)

               I'll wait right here for you...

               TONI'S whisperings become a constant, soothing, mantra.  WALTER'S 
               eyes close.  Dressed in sweats and sneakers.  Gone.  TONI loosens 
               his laces, covers him with a blanket, slides under the covers. 
                TONI kills the light.  Seen in darkness.  Holding WALTER close, 
               draping a protective arm around and --
 

               INT. SALES ROOM - DAY


               A SLEDGE HAMMER smashes through a wall.  DELIVERYMEN dolly in 
               new desks and chairs to accomodate more salesmen.  SOUTHIE and 
               REGGIE at the water fountain, watch the room expand.
 
                                     SOUTHIE
               You see him this morning?  Wearing those suits to work now.
 
               
                                     REGGIE
               He keeps picking 90 percent I'll press the fuckers for him.
 
               
               WALTER walks in, stops at the front desk, speaks to TAMMY.

                                     WALTER
               What a weekened!  Helluva Christmas bonus if this keeps up.  
               Where'd you hide the phone sheet?
 
               TAMMY locates the sheet, hands it to him.  WALTER studies it, 
               starts away.  He sees something, stops.  Walking back --
 
                                     WALTER
               (to TAMMY, pointing on the sheet)

               Who's this?  This guy here -- Lang? 

                                     TAMMY
               I dunno, he said it was personal.  

                                     WALTER
               Did Brandon take the call?

               Tammy

               He wasn't in.  

                                     WALTER
               Don't mention it to him.  And don't patch the guy through.  Say 
               Brandon doesn't work here, you can't reach him.
 

               INT. BRANDON'S OFFICE - DAY


               BRANDON at his desk, reading The New York Post.  JERRY enters.
 
               
                                     JERRY
               You know anything about Stokley being out this weekend against 
               the New York?
 
                                     BRANDON
               A knock would be nice, Jerry.

                                     JERRY
               I'm underwater here, man.  Yes or no?

                                     BRANDON
               No.

                                     JERRY
               You know something... You hear anything, let me know.  That's 
               how this works.
 
                                     BRANDON
               I'll rush right over.  Stat.

                                     JERRY
               All inside information gets shared.

                                     BRANDON
               Inside?  I've got nothing inside.

                                     JERRY
               F.Y.I. -- we work as a team here, that's the way we do it.  I'll 
               do the same for you.  So stop holding out on me, babe.       
                
 
                                     BRANDON
               This wouldn't have anything to do with 

               you going 30 percent this weekend, would it?

                                     JERRY
               Listen you little shit, I've been doing this six years to your 
               one.
 
                                     WALTER
               (entering, to JERRY--)

               What are you doing in here?  Hit the phones and do some damage 
               control -- re-write your frigging computer program.
 
                                     JERRY
               Hey, it was a fucked weekend.

                                     WALTER
               For some people.   

               (to BRANDON)

                                     WALTER
               There's a 50-dime bettor on line three.  Wants to talk to John 
               Anthony.
 
                                     BRANDON
               Who?

                                     WALTER
               His name's Carl.  Carl owns a couple dozen McDonalds franchises. 
                Guy's a gazillionaire.  That sign out front might as well be 
               his bank account.
 
                                     JERRY
               No no no no no.  What'd you mean?  I landed that lead!  That's 
               my guy!   
 
                                     WALTER
               Was.

                                     JERRY
               He's raiding my fucking lists!

                                     WALTER
               Your clients are jumping ship you lactose intolerant fuck!  Get 
               outta my sight!
 
               JERRY leaves.  BRANDON picks up the phone --

                                     BRANDON
               Carl, John Anthony here, how's the fast-food king...?  Good--
 
               

               INT. WALTER AND TONI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT


               The door opens.  TONI, carrying groceries, and JULIA, dressed 
               in ballerina clothes enter, walk into the kitchen.
 
                                     JULIA
               Can we play?

                                     TONI
               Okay, let me just put the groceries away.

                                     JULIA
               I want to play princess.

                                     TONI
               So do I.  Go put your dress on.

               JULIA runs off to her room when TONI suddenly spies a tacky, 
               woman's jacket draped on a chair.  TONI regards it and --
 
               The CAMERA tracks TONI through the apartment.  Down the hall. 
                Voices heard.  A man and woman as -- WALTER emerges from his 
               office with a CALL GIRL.  He's pulling bills from his wallet.
 
               
                                     WALTER
               Easy 200, huh?  Here's something extra for a cab.

                                     GIRL
               Thanks, Walter.  Talk to ya.

                                     WALTER
               (seeing TONI)

               I can explain.

               The CALL GIRL slides by, shows herself out.  TONI staring.

                                     WALTER
               No, no, you think she was for me?  Are you crazy?  No.  I just 
               had her come up to pay her.  I got her for John. 
 
                                     TONI
               I don't give a damn who you got her for!  We have a 6-year-old 
               in the house, Walter!  What the hell is going on here?
 
               (looking in, checking the made bed)

               Don't bullshit me!

                                     WALTER
               You think I slept with her?  C'mon!

                                     TONI
               Who the hell's John?

                                     WALTER
               Brandon, we all call him John now.

                                     TONI
               You got Brandon a hooker?

                                     WALTER
               New city, no friends, working all hours.

                                     TONI
               What the hell are you creating here, Walter? 

                                     WALTER
               I don't understand this.  I was helping him out, that's all.
 
               
                                     TONI
               Helping him?  Really?  Like the others before him?

                                     WALTER
               This kid's different, he's different -- wait a minute.  This 
               has nothing to do with you, you know I do business up here.  
               Why are you so angry?
 
                                     TONI
               Are we actually going to have this conversation?  Are you completely 
               clueless? 
 
                                     WALTER
               You're jealous.  Look at you!

                                     TONI
               Of what?!

                                     WALTER
               Gee, I don't know -- Brandon screwing someone?

                                     TONI
               You really are fucking crazy, Walter!  That never entered my 
               mind!
 
                                     WALTER
               That's not where those thoughts enter.

                                     TONI
               Fuck you!

               TONI goes into the kitchen, slams the door.  Calling to her --
 
               
                                     WALTER
               You'll be happy to know he didn't sleep with her.  I paid her 
               off just for coming.  No pun intended.
 
               WALTER grimaces, clutches his side.  WALTER pops one, two -- 
               three pills from a vial, let's them settle as JULIA, princess 
               clothes, runs down the hall, leaps in his arms.  WALTER stifles 
               the pain of her embrace.  Carries her down the hall.
 
                                     WALTER
               ... Julia my jewel, you're getting big angel.

                                     JULIA
               Can we play princess, Daddy?

                                     WALTER
               Course we can.  Who am I gonna be?

                                     JULIA
               You're the king, daddy, like always.


               INT. SPORTS ADVISORS TV SET - NIGHT


               BRANDON practicing John Anthony expressions.  A pretty MAKE-UP 
               ARTIST finishes touching him up.
 
                                     MAKE-UP ARTIST
               I made 500 bucks off your picks last week.  I was thinking maybe 
               we could go out later and get a little wild... you can help me 
               blow some.    
 
                                     BRANDON
               Let's get really wild and you can blow mine.

               The GIRL laughs.  BRANDON crosses the stage, takes his place 
               on the set between WALTER and JERRY.  CHUCK sits off to the side, 
               eating a muffin.  WALTER looks voer at BRANDON -- 
 
                                     WALTER
               Look at you.  I like the tan.

                                     BRANDON
               Toni put one of those lamps down in my room.  The ladies do love 
               it. 
 
                                     TECHNICIAN
               60 seconds!

                                     WALTER
               John's up first tonight, Jerry.

                                     JERRY
               What?

                                     WALTER
               John Anthony's leading off tonight.

                                     JERRY
               John Anthony's leading?

                                     WALTER
               Somebody tell the engineer there's an echo in here.

                                     JERRY
               Two years I lead and you bury me in the deck over a few lousy 
               fucking weekends?  The Sykes System's based on percentages -- 
               the long haul.
 
                                     WALTER
               No, that's called a mutual fund, Jerry.

                                     JERRY
               (to CHUCK)

               You gonna sit for this shit? 

               CHUCK shrugs, finishes his muffin.  JERRY turns to WALTER --
 
               
                                     JERRY
               ... He leads, I'm walking.

                                     WALTER
               He's leading.

               JERRY unclips his microphone, stands.

                                     WALTER
               That's baby talk!  You need a fucking rattle!  Sit down!

               (staring him down)

               You probably think you know what I'm gonna say... how everything 
               you got I pay for.  Your apartment, your car, your kid's school 
               -- and it's true.  You'd be right.  I do.  Now I don't know, 
               Jerry, maybe you break your losing streak, end the shneid, start 
               winning again and find yourself another job, but then of course 
               maybe you don't.  I don't see you taking that chance.  My gut 
               says you'll walk out of here on principle or even pride but not 
               on a gamble, a hunch yet.  And if you do, fuck it.  I give a 
               shit?  The only reason I keep you around is it makes me look 
               loyal and him--
 
               (pointing at BRANDON)

               --look good!  Now you got three fucking seconds to stop standing 
               there like dog
 
               shit on my porch and sit down and shut

               the fuck up or you can kiss everything you have goodbye!  The 
               clock's started. 
 
               Beat.  JERRY sinks into his seat.  WALTER turns to BRANDON.
 
               
                                     WALTER
               See that?  He made the safe play.  Me, I would've walked, but 
               I'm a fucked-up human being.  That's the difference between us. 
                Right there.  Jerry's a statistician, I'm a gambler.  And you're 
               not a gambler, not really -- until you bet more than you can 
               afford to lose.

               BRANDON done taping, wiping off make-up, talking on his cell 
               -- 
 
                                     BRANDON
               Denny, it's me... What'd I tell ya?...  Hey, it's your money, 
               dude, you won it...  Well did you hook it up yet?... Hell yeah, 
               crank it, let me hear--
 

               INTERCUT - EXT. DENNY AT HOME IN GARAGE - NIGHT 


               Denny on his cell, crouched under the dash of his car, wiring 
               a new stereo.  He touches two wires and the sound system BOOMS 
               to life, deafening hip-hop before Denny disconnects the wires. 
                   
 
                                     DENNY
               It's the bomb, B!

                                     BRANDON
               Sure sounds like it!  I'm heading out with some people, everything 
               else cool?
 
                                     DENNY
               Everything's great.  Did dad reach you?

                                     BRANDON
               Dad?  No, why?

                                     DENNY
               He keeps calling.  He saw you on tv, wants to talk to you.  I 
               gave him your work number but he says they won't put him through.
 
               
                                     BRANDON
               Really?

               BRANDON'S eye catches WALTER across the set, watching a playback 
               of the show.  TONI enters the studio, kisses WALTER hello and 
               --
 

               INT. TV PRODUCTION HOUSE LOBBY - NIGHT


               WALTER, BRANDON and TONI exit the stage, enter into the lobby.
 
               
                                     WALTER
               I'm starved, there's a new steak house around the corner.  You 
               two split a prime rib, I'll get the porterhouse, we'll whack 
               it up!
 
                                     TONI
               Let's walk, you could use the exercise. 

                                     WALTER
               Stop worrying.  We're set--

               (arm around BRANDON)

               --I got the next Jimmy the Greek here!  I'm serious!  Nostra-fucking-damus 
               was a novelty act next to this guy!  
 
                                     BRANDON
               Let me ask you something, Walter.  

                                     WALTER
               Shoot.

                                     BRANDON
               Have you been blocking any of my calls?

                                     WALTER
               Of course.  You don't need distractions, there's a lot of crazies 
               out there. 
 
                                     BRANDON
               Does that include my father?

                                     WALTER
               You're asking, I'll tell you... Yeah.

                                     BRANDON
               (striding outside)

               Son of a bitch -- for how long? 

                                     WALTER
               (following)

               Week or so.

                                     TONI
               Walter.


               EXT. TV PRODUCTION HOUSE BUILDING - NIGHT


               WALTER and TONI trail BRANDON down the lamp-lit sidewalk.

                                     WALTER
               Hold on, Brandon, if I didn't block his calls would you've talked 
               to him?  Honestly.
 
                                     BRANDON
               That's not the point!

                                     WALTER
               Then what exactly is the point, Brandon? What's the full story 
               here?  What's the deal with your old man?  
 
                                     BRANDON
               You tell it, you seem to know.

                                     WALTER
               --I only know pieces.  I was trying to spare you from something.
 
               
                                     BRANDON
               (stopping under a street light)

               Spare me?  By blocking my calls?  There's nothing you can spare 
               me from.  He's a drunk.  Left when I was 9.  I couldn't t compete 
               with a bottle.  End of story.
 
                                     WALTER
               ... That's it?  That's the best you can do?  Hell, Toni and I'll 
               match our dysfunctional childhoods against yours
 
               any day of the week.  My father, 5-foot- 

               arms like this, cock the size of a hebrew national -- if I even 
               looked at him wrong he knocked me across the room like LaMotta. 
                He yelled so much, until I was five I thought my name was asshole. 
                Tell him about you, Toni.  Well go on --
 
                                     TONI
               I didn't have a great home-life either.

                                     WALTER
               "Great?"  Tell him about the uncle--

                                     TONI
               --He gets the idea.

                                     WALTER
               Don't sugarcoat this shit, you were abused by everybody but the 
               family pet, isn't that right, honey?
 
                                     TONI
               Walter, please.

                                     WALTER
               (to BRANDON)

               Your father was a drunk, a jerk -- so what?  It happens.  I'm 
               glad I blew him off.  Know why?  Because what you need is a new 
               image of a man.  How 'bout me?
 
                                     BRANDON
               That's a really scary thought.

                                     WALTER
               If not me, then pick someone else.  It's all in your head!  The 
               shit that happened to you, to Toni, to me -- you know what it 
               is?  Just that, shit that happened.
 
                                     
                                     WALTER CON'D
               It's not who we are.  After 

                                     
               Walter con'd

               all the therapy and the analysis and the meetings and the -- 
               aaahhhh! -- the one thing I know--
 
               (yelling to the sky)

               --WE'RE ALL FUCKED UP!  We are all just so fucked up!

               (to BRANDON)

               Say it!  Shout it!  Come on, you two -- wallow with me here!
 
               
               A MAN sticks his head out a window down the street, yells --
 
               
                                     MAN
               I'm trying to sleep, asshole!

                                     WALTER
               Dad!  Is that you?

                                     MAN
               I'll crush you like a beetle!

                                     WALTER
               How's Mom?!

                                     MAN
               Fucking freak!

                                     WALTER
               I love you too!  Don't wait up!

               WALTER, TONI and BRANDON all laugh.  The three of them doubled 
               over on the dark, deserted street.  MAN screaming from above. 
                The ring of a phone begins bleeding in and --
 

               INT. BRANDON'S OFFICE - DAY


               New furniture and sports photos on the walls suggest the passage 
               of time.  BRANDON stands before a mirror, being fitted for a 
               suit by a TAILOR.  He has a cigar in one hand, Coke in the other, 
               talks into a headset as he watches the TAILOR work.
 
                                     BRANDON
               Are you serious, Amir?  You gonna fucking haggle with me over 
               a measly 50 thousand on the 250 grand I won you this weekend?
 
               

               EXT. AMIR'S DRY CLEANERS - DAY


               AMIR (sharply attired) stands outside his business, leaning against 
               a brand new, red Ferrari as he talks on the phone.  
 
                                     AMIR
               Don't get me wrong, John.  I'm thankful, very much, you're amazing, 
               it's just that 50 thousand seems slightly steep--
 
                                     BRANDON
               --The first time you call me you're in a hole the size of the 
               Grand Canyon, you're crying about hocking your fiance's ring 
               and this weekend you're phoning me from a suite at the Bellagio 
               that I put you in -- you know what -- I'm cutting you off... 
               You want to continue with me, I'm tagging on a 10 percent aggravation 
               tax!  Now get to Western Union and shoot me 75 grand by tonight 
               and we'll kiss and make up.

               No cuff.

               Brandon, is that you?

               That's me.

               Are you okay?

                                     BRANDON
               Never better.  Kicking ass and taking names.  Did you get the 
               money I sent?
 
                                     BRANDON'S MOTHER
               Well that's why I'm calling, honey.

                                     BRANDON
               Good good good.  I talked to Denny.  Next month I'm flying you 
               and him out here.  First class.  I'll put you up at The Plaza. 
                You'll love this joint.
 
                                     BRANDON'S MOTHER
               It sounds great, Brandon, but the money -- it's too much.  Where 
               did you get it?
 
                                     BRANDON
               I made it.  Earned it.  Every fucking cent.  Put it in Denny's 
               college fund.
 
                                     BRANDON'S MOTHER
               Listen to you.

                                     BRANDON
               It's just how people talk here.

               (looking down at the TAILOR, edge)

               How many times I gotta say no cuff?

                                     BRANDON'S MOTHER
               Who's this John Anthony person?

                                     BRANDON
               He's me.  I'm him.

                                     BRANDON'S MOTHER
               And he talks like that?

                                     BRANDON
               He's pretty fucking salty -- geez, I'm sorry, Mom -- I mean yeah. 
                Look, the main point is I'm learning a lot here.
 
                                     BRANDON'S MOTHER
               Then you should know you can't be two people, Brandon.

                                     BRANDON
               I appreciate the concern, Ma, but the checks I've been sending 
               -- the checks you've been cashing -- those are from John Anthony.
 
               
                                     BRANDON'S MOTHER
               Funny, I thought they were from my son.

               WALTER enters, slaps an airline ticket on his desk.

                                     WALTER
               We're going to Puerto Rico!

                                     BRANDON
               Gotta put you on hold, Ma.

               (pressing a button on the headset)

               What's in Puerto Rico?

                                     WALTER
               Since Ricky Martin moved out, all that's left are tourists, cruise 
               ships and C.M. Novian -- one of the biggest sports bettors in 
               the world.  He just called.  Wants to meet you in person!  To-day! 
                Flight leaves Laguardia in 45 minutes.  
 
                                     BRANDON
               (activating the headset)

               I gotta go, Ma... Ma... Son of a bitch --  my own fucking mother 
               hung up on me!
 

               EXT. SAN JUAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT 


               An AIRLINER roars in for landing.


               INT. AIRLINE TERMINAL - NIGHT


               WALTER and BRANDON pass through FRAME.

                                     BRANDON
               What do you know about him?

                                     WALTER
               Not much, 'cept for the fact he's a world class prick.  Bastard 
               treated me worse than my Hong Kong tailor.  Never once returned 
               a call.  I've been trying to bag this guy for years.  Do you 
               have any idea what this is worth?
 
                                     BRANDON
               No, but I want a bonus if we pull it off.

                                     WALTER
               Look at me.  There is no if -- it's only when.  This time he 
               called us, remember?  You hooked him.  Know that.  Sweat that.
 
               
                                     BRANDON
               Relax, I'll get in character in the car.  

               WALTER suddenly slows, winces.  He angles toward a bathroom.
 
               
                                     BRANDON
               ... Walter?

               WALTER grabs for a water fountain, misses, suddenly collapses. 
                
 
                                     BRANDON
               Your vial -- where's your pills, Walter?

               WALTER finds the vial, pops it, his chest heaves and the pills 
               spill on the floor.  WALTER looks wide-eyed up at BRANDON, mouths 
               "Big one."  BRANDON frantically loosens WALTER'S shirt.  A crowd 
               gathers.  A BUSINESSMAN pulls a cell phone, dials 911.    
 
               
                                     BRANDON
               Hold on, Walter we're getting help!  Oh my God.  Listen to me. 
                Walter -- Walter.  You're gonna be fine.  Hold on!
 
               (to the CROWD)

               We need a doctor!  Is there a doctor?

                                     WALTER
               Brandon --

                                     BRANDON
               Save your strength.  Help's coming.  Help's coming.

                                     WALTER
               ... Do you love me?

                                     BRANDON
               Of course I do.

                                     WALTER
               Uh-huh.

                                     BRANDON
               I do.  I really do love you.

                                     WALTER
               ... How much?

                                     BRANDON
               A lot!  Now don't talk.  

               (turning to the CROWD)

               We need a doctor!  

               Several stunned ONLOOKERS run for help.  WALTER fading fast.
 
               
                                     WALTER
               I believe you.  I believe you love me.  I love you too... Just 
               one thing -- 
 
                                     BRANDON
               Save your strength, Walter.

                                     WALTER
               ... Would you love me if this was a joke?

                                     BRANDON
               What?

                                     WALTER
               I'm fine.  Just practicing...

               WALTER smiles.  Stands.  Brushes himself off.  To the CROWD --
 
               
                                     WALTER
               I'm okay!  Little gas.  Must've had too many peanuts on the plane.
 
               
               The confused ONLOOKERS drift away.  

                                     BRANDON
               You sick fucking fuck!  That was too goddamn fucking far!!!
 
               
                                     WALTER
               You weren't listening!  You're not paying attention to me!  There's 
               no such thing as too far!  Push everything as far as you can! 
                Push it until it starts pushing back and then push some goddamn 
               more!  Remember that when you're with this guy today!
 
                                     OMIT

               INT. PUERTO RICAN MANSION - DAY


               Palatial.  Drapes dance before the open doors.  Music plays. 
                BRANDON and WALTER sit in the living room.  Peaceful beat.
 
               
                                     WALTER
               I start to die, fuck the hospital, just sit me down, I wanna 
               kack here.
 
               A beefy BODYGUARD enters followed by a tan, broad shouldered 
               MAN of 50.  WALTER extends his hand.
 
                                     WALTER
               Mr. Novian!  What can I say?  An honor.  This is my associate, 
               John Anthony.
 
               MR. NOVIAN nods, settles in a chair.  WALTER and BRANDON sit. 
               
 
                                     NOVIAN
               You should know I think that most sports services are a complete 
               scam... However, I hear your boy here's having quite a season. 
                What's your system?
 
                                     WALTER
               (looking around)

               Our system?  Fuck that, what's your system?

               Walter laughs.  Novian stone-faced, glances at his watch when--
 
               
                                     BRANDON
               It's a privilege to meet you, Mr. Novian.   You have a beautiful 
               home.  Let's start with how much you bet.
 
                                     NOVIAN
               A million a game, across the board.

                                     BRANDON
               Nice round number, is that our ceiling here?  Is that the most 
               we're working with?
 
                                     NOVIAN
               "We're" not doing anything until I hear how you feel about this 
               weekend.
 
                                     BRANDON
               Do you rent that yacht out there?

                                     NOVIAN
               I own it.

                                     BRANDON
               Well, sir, that's how I feel about this weekend.  That may sound 
               cocky, I don't care.  I didn't come down here to lie. 
 
                                     NOVIAN
               Do you have inside information?

                                     BRANDON
               If I did I wouldn't share that with you.  My record speaks for 
               itself.  The truth is I know these teams better than they know 
               themselves.  I'm going 12 for 12 this weekend, and that includes 
               the Monday Night parlay.   
 
                                     NOVIAN
               Why should I believe you?

                                     BRANDON
               With all due respect, Mr. Novian, you can't afford not to.

                                     NOVIAN
               I can afford to do any damn thing I please.

                                     BRANDON
               Can you?  What I'm saying is can you -- can anyone for that matter 
               -- afford to lose as much as a man like you probably needs to 
               bet to feel a win?  Winning's a funny thing, Mr. Novian... it's 
               one of those rare commodities on earth money can't buy.  Or was, 
               until you called me.
 
               Charged beat.  A tight grin's glued to WALTER'S face.

                                     BRANDON
               The price is a quarter million, Mr. Novian -- up-front -- in 
               addition to a percentage of every game you win.
 
                                     NOVIAN
               Fuck you.  I never pay anything up front. 

                                     BRANDON
               And we've never charged it before.  But with what you're betting, 
               250 up front's a bargain.  You want this weekend's winners, that's 
               my offer.  Take it or leave it.
 
                                     NOVIAN
               (standing)

               ... Step outside.

               BRANDON and WALTER exchange looks, unsure where this is going.
 
               

               EXT. NOVIAN'S BALCONY - DAY


               NOVIAN and BRANDON regard a group of GIRLS lounging topless by 
               a pool.
 
                                     NOVIAN
               ... Ever pick oranges, Mr. Anthony?

                                     BRANDON
               Nope.

                                     NOVIAN
               I have, in fact it's how I started.

               Builds character.  See those girls down there?  Pretend they're 
               oranges and pick some ripe ones.  Take 'em upstairs and build 
               some character.  Mr. Abrams and I need to refine the terms.
 
               
               BRANDON goes to an ice-filled cooler by the door, pulls a bottle 
               of champagne, carries it dripping down to the pool and-- 
 

               INT. BRANDON'S OFFICE - DAY


               A FOOTBALL BETTING FORM fills FRAME.  Two columns of teams seen. 
                Point spreads penciled in between them.  11 of 12 games checked 
               off.  Monday Night the last to be decided.
 
               PULL BACK TO SHOW -- BRANDON in his office, the unfinished form 
               before him.  A young SALESMAN appears at the door.
 
                                     YOUNG SALESMAN
               They need it, Mr. Anthony.

               BRANDON picks up his pen, regards the box for Monday Night -- 
               Seattle or New Orleans?  The point spread is Seattle minus 3. 
                A box beside it is for the over/under.  That number is 34.  
               BRANDON about to pick when he stops, looks up, smiles --
 
                                     BRANDON
               Three questions.  What's your mother's name?

                                     YOUNG SALESMAN
               Shelia.

                                     BRANDON
               What street did you grow up on?

                                     YOUNG SALESMAN
               Atlantic Avenue.

                                     BRANDON
               Who do you like Monday night?

                                     YOUNG SALESMAN
               I don't know.

                                     BRANDON
               Pick one.

                                     YOUNG SALESMAN
               That's your job.

                                     BRANDON
               I'll do your job tomorrow, today you do mine.

                                     YOUNG SALESMAN
               What are you talking about?

                                     BRANDON
               Pick one.  Stop stalling.  You know who's playing.  Seattle versus 
               New Orleans.
 
                                     YOUNG SALESMAN
               ... I dunno.  I guess I like Seattle giving the two points.
 
               
                                     BRANDON
               (writing on the form)

               Over or under?

                                     YOUNG SALESMAN
               You can't do that.

                                     BRANDON
               Sure I can!  Over 34 points or under!

                                     YOUNG SALESMAN
               Over!

               BRANDON checks it off, gives him the finished form.

                                     YOUNG SALESMAN
               I'm not handing that in.  Like a million dollars is going on 
               that game!
 
                                     BRANDON
               Like a lot more than that.  Relax.  I think we know I can pick. 
                Today I'm picking you.  The outcome'll be the same.
 
                                     YOUNG SALESMAN
               What if I'm wrong?

                                     BRANDON
               Didn't they tell you?  There is no if.


               INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - NIGHT


               MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL.  Final seconds of a hard-fought game. 
               The Seattle QUARTERBACK'S driving, completes a long pass to a 
               RECEIVER who's brought down at the New Orleans 10-yard line. 
               
 
                                     WALTER
               They score, we win!

               AL MICHAELS/vo from tv

               --Kuhn's stopped at the 10!  Seattle down by three.  Two seconds 
               on the clock.  Kuhn suffered a concussion last week and with 
               that foot injury in the first quarter he has no mobility -- Hanratty 
               drops back, he's out of the pocket, breaks one tackle, throws 
               downfield, it's tipped!  Raymond's got it!  Breaks the plane! 
                Touch down!  Seattle takes it 20 to 17!  They win by three! 
                What a game!
 
               The buzz in the BG explodes as we see -- every EMPLOYEE is packed 
               into WALTER'S office.  Riot of celebration all around. 
 
                                     WALTER
               100 fucking percent!

               Champagne corks start popping.  Someone hits the remote and the 
               wall of screens fill with a jamming MTV video.  The lights dim. 
                People start dancing.  Cell phones start ringing and --
 
               VARIOUS SALESMEN/into phones

               -- Call back tomorrow! 

               -- Who knows who he likes next week you   fucking degenerate! 
               
 
               -- I don't have anything yet! 

               The YOUNG SALESMAN who made the Monday night and over/under picks 
               talks excitedly to SOUTHIE and REGGIE.
 
                                     YOUNG SALESMAN
               He kinda mesmerized me, see, and like Spock or something I visualized 
               Seattle and the over and he wrote it down!  Said picking me was 
               the same as him doing it.
 
                                     SOUTHIE
               What kinda power is that?

                                     REGGIE
               Who fucking cares?  He's money.

               JERRY SYKES stands nearby, listening.  Whoops of excitement as 
               WALTER jumps up on his desk, starts throwing cash.  JERRY moves 
               through the raucous CROWD, finds BRANDON against a wall, out 
               of the fray, watching WALTER hurl money in the air.
 
                                     JERRY
               Congratulations, Brandon... Or should I say John?  Either way 
               it's amazing.  I must say I am impressed.  Letting salesmen make 
               your picks?  That's balls.
 
                                     BRANDON
               (watching WALTER hurl money)

               Best get in there and collect some of this, Jerry.  The way you're 
               picking, you're gonna need some for a rainy day.
 
                                     JERRY
               Keep talking, sugarmouth.  Must feel pretty good to be that plugged 
               in.  You got a good streak going.  Well enjoy it while it lasts. 
                The gambling Gods are a fickle bunch, sooooo easily offended.
 
               
               BRANDON makes his way through the room, reaches WALTER.

                                     WALTER
               Here, get you teeth fixed.  There might be some other businesses 
               you can make two mill in one weekend, but tell me, someone please 
               tell me -- where else are you gonna have this much fun?
 
                                     BRANDON
               How much of that big stack's mine?

                                     WALTER
               A one with five zeros behind it.

                                     BRANDON
               ...A 100 fucking thou?  On two million?

                                     WALTER
               You're working out of my shop.

                                     BRANDON
               I was thinking of ten percent.

                                     WALTER
               Really?  Is that what you were thinking?

                                     BRANDON
               I got you Novian.

                                     WALTER
               Nice job, now don't blow it by getting ahead of yourself.  I'm 
               looking beyond the money. 
 
                                     BRANDON
               You can afford to, you're holding it all.  C'mon, I only want 
               what's fair, Walter.
 
               WALTER smiles.  Wraps an arm around.  Puts him in a headlock.
 
               
                                     WALTER
               "Fair?"  Honey, you don't know what fair is.  What's fair is 
               not giving you the money.  Now I'm only gonna say this once. 
                If you want something from me more than a gazunheidt after a 
               sneeze you have to do more than think about it.  Or ask for it. 
                You gotta earn it.  You gotta fight for it.  You gotta rip it 
               out of my fucking talons.  John Anthony would know that.  That's 
               what he'd do.  As a matter of fact, next time you come with that 
               shit, come as John Anthony.  'Cause from now on I'm not talking 
               to you about money.
 
               BRANDON pulls free.  Stunned.  Seething.  MTV pounds from the 
               TVs, people dancing all around.  TONI walks up.
 
                                     TONI
               The big winner.  How are you doing?

                                     BRANDON
               I'm winning... I'm winning...

               BRANDON leaves.  WALTER pulls her close, moves with the music.
 
               
                                     WALTER
               Dance with me.  Close, that's it.  I gotta dance with you more. 
                Listen, I'm thinking of buying a plane.  Big one.  G-something. 
                We can just get on it and go, you and me, anywhere in the world, 
               any time we want.  There's a house for sale in the Bahamas with 
               a runway right beside it.  Comes with its own 50-foot boat.  
               Two for one.  What an investment.  Anything happens, you and 
               Jules always have it.  Let's go down and check it out.  Next 
               week, just us, barefoot in the sand.
 
               (TONI watching him)

               Well say something.         

                                     TONI
               ... Are you gambling again, Walter?

                                     WALTER
               What?  Oh, c'mon -- hell no.  

                                     TONI
               Look me in the eye and say it.

                                     WALTER
               I am not gambling.  Not now, not ever.  18 years clean.  That 
               shit's over. 
 
                                     TONI
               It's never over, Walter.  You know that.  

                                     WALTER
               Get a lie detector if you don't believe me.  Shoot me with truth 
               serum.  Baby -- we just made two-million dollars.  I'm working 
               miracles here.  Now can I enjoy a dance with my wife?  Huh?  
               I swear, it's a shame you can't drink, we need something to kill 
               that bug up your ass.
 
               TONI smiles.  WALTER holds her close, kisses her and --


               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT


               BRANDON'S Mercedes speeds into the city.


               INT. MANHATTAN STRIP CLUB - NIGHT


               Big breasts, G-strings, testosterone.  BRANDON in a booth with 
               a topless BLACK GIRL.  We can see from his moves it's the Million 
               Dollar Man talking.  Drinking Dom.  Flashing cash.  He whispers 
               something to her.  She reaches for her top as he grabs the hand 
               of her topless FRIEND and --
 

               INT. STRIP CLUB - PRIVATE BACK ROOM - NIGHT


               DARKNESS.  A light goes on, illuminates a cave-like bedroom. 
                MUSIC from the club rumbles through the space, reduced to a 
               driving bass beat.  The ASIAN GIRL pulls an outrageous wad of 
               cash from BRANDON'S pocket, tosses it confetti-like in the air 
               as -- BRANDON, the ASIAN GIRL and the BLACK GIRL fall on the 
               gold lame sheets.  Clothes are peeled off, money sticking to 
               their bodies, GIRLS clawing the cash from BRANDON'S skin --
 
               
               Black girL

               (kissing his neck, hands roving)

               What's it feel like to do what you do?  To win like that?

               BRANDON flips her over, leans in from behind.

                                     BRANDON
               It's just like sex.  You start by massaging the numbers, very 
               relaxed,
 
               getting a feel, see how they move.  Then there's a shift, a plan 
               forms and you connect to your teams.
 
               (the GIRL moans, reacting to something unseen)

               Sunday's like penetration and the games have started and teams 
               are scoring and 
 
               you're inside and you're doing it and 

               it's doing you, feeling every shift,

               every score, every trickle of sweat --

               the giving, taking, the long, the short,

               excitement growing bigger and bigger--

               (BRANDON cupping her breasts)

               And it's not an idea or part of you anymore -- it is you, all 
               of you -- and the crowd's roaring and the clock's 
 
               ticking and you know everything except 

               how it'll end and and then you've won -- over and over and over 
               and it's like one, big, huge, insane, weekend-long orgasm.
 
               
                                     FRIEND
               (totally turned on, kissing him)

               Nice job description.

               BRANDON presses her below FRAME, naked ASIAN GIRL climbing on 
               top as the sound of APPLAUSE is heard, building in volume and--
 
               

               INT. BROWNSTONE SALESROOM - DAY


               25 SALESMEN stand on their desks, clapping, as BRANDON passes 
               through on the way to his office.  Only it's John Anthony who's 
               strutting through the room, high-fiving SALESMEN, kissing the 
               GIRLS, a tanned, tailored, magnetic presence and --
 

               INT. BROWNSTONE - BRANDON'S OFFICE - MORNING


               WALTER waits within, standing at the window overlooking the sales 
               room as BRANDON enters.
 
                                     WALTER
               Know what time it is?

                                     BRANDON
               (glance at his watch)

               Yeah, it's--

                                     WALTER
               --Wrong.  It's time to press, my friend.  We're yanking out all 
               the stops.  When you're winning -- you press.  
 
               BRANDON rummaging a closet, produces a set of golf clubs. 

                                     WALTER
               What are you doing?

                                     BRANDON
               I have a 10:30 tee time at Wingfoot with a client, that Howell 
               guy.  Don't call me unless the lines change.
 
                                     WALTER
               The salmon are running!  You're staying right here and fielding 
               calls.  You're not going off to play golf and have fun.
 
                                     BRANDON
               Fun?  Senor, you have obviously never played Wingfoot.

                                     WALTER
               Stop screwing around, you got a lot to do before this weekend. 
                
 
                                     BRANDON
               I'm not asking you if I can leave, Walter -- I'm telling you 
               that's how it is, understood?  You want my picks, hell I'll make 
               'em now.  
 
               BRANDON sits, starts filling out the week's betting form.

                                     WALTER
               Whoa -- hold on -- slow down -- today's only Tuesday, you have 
               all week.
 
                                     BRANDON
               I don't need it.

                                     WALTER
               Hey -- we're gonna be advising somewhere in the neighborhood 
               of 20 million dollars this week.
 
                                     BRANDON
               Nice neighborhood.

                                     WALTER
               You're really gonna make your picks now?  No study?  No analysis? 
                Just like that?
 
                                     BRANDON
               I'm in the zone, Walter.  Locked in.  You want my picks, I might 
               as well do it now!
 
               Washington at Miami giving 8, Washington!

               Saint Louis at K.C. getting 12 -- K.C. by three touchdowns!  
               Pittsburgh at Philly giving 3 -- Philly, another blow out! 
 
               
               (handing WALTER the finished form)

               Brandon con'd

               There they are, unless you want next weekend's picks too.  You're 
               welcome to join me, Walter, it's a beautiful track.  
 
                                     WALTER
               ... Okay, fine.  Take a break.  Go play golf.  We'll put the 
               picks on ice and look 'em over tomorrow.
 
                                     BRANDON
               (walking out)

               I won't be in tomorrow.

                                     WALTER
               Then the next day!

               But BRANDON'S gone.  WALTER considers what's just occured, regards 
               the finished betting form.  He dons his glasses and begin examining 
               BRANDON'S picks and --
 

               EXT. OUTSIDE THE BROWNSTONE - DAY


               BRANDON loads his golf clubs in the Mercedes, spies TONI coming 
               down the front steps.
 
                                     BRANDON
               Where're you headed?

                                     TONI
               Some of us have to work.

                                     BRANDON
               Come on, get in.  I'll give you a lift.

               ANGLE ON -- upper brownstone window.  WALTER looks down.  Watches 
               TONI'S legs swing into BRANDON'S sports car and --
 

               INT. MOVING MERCEDES - DAY


               BRANDON speeds fast down a street.  Uncomfortable beat.

                                     BRANDON
               Some ride, huh?  Feel that?  Feel that?

                                     TONI
               Slow down, Brandon.

                                     BRANDON
               Why?  This car was made to go fast.

                                     TONI
               Not with me in it.

                                     BRANDON
               C'mon, Toni, loosen up.  

               (goosing the gas, laughing)

               Let me ask you something.  When you're not at the shop, or running 
               Julia to play dates or keeping Walter from losing his mind, which 
               I know is a full-time job,
 
               what do you do for you, Toni? 

                                     TONI
               I stay busy.

                                     BRANDON
               That's not what I asked.

                                     TONI
               Yes it is.

                                     BRANDON
               What do you do for you, Toni, for yourself.

                                     TONI
               "What do I do for myself?"  If you drove past my salon and went 
               two blocks down Prospect Street you would have found me 20 years 
               ago with a needle in my arm.  I was a 5-bag a day junkie.  I 
               would have sold Julia to get high.  Keeping it all on track, 
               that's what I do for myself.  
 
                                     BRANDON
               That's not living, Toni.  That's just maintaining.  You cashed 
               in. 
 
                                     TONI
               What the hell does that mean?  Are we talking perfection here?
 
               
                                     BRANDON
               Well, nobody's perfect... except me last weekend going 14 and 
               0.  
 
               BRANDON pulls up outside her shop.  TONI regards him.

                                     TONI
               Yeah, that's living.

                                     BRANDON
               Hell yeah.  You oughta try it some time.

                                     TONI
               (stepping from the car)

               Thanks for the ride, John...

               TONI enters her shop and --


               INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - DAY


               Eight football games are winding down, another four starting. 
                Favor one of the TV SCREENS.  A network sports update.  CHRIS 
               BERMAN motor-mouthing a one-minute list of results.
 
                                     CHRIS BERMAN
               -- Big loss for Washington, going down 24-12 in Miami.  Saint 
               Louis upsets K.C., 34-14.  And another Sunday surprise, Philly 
               trounces Pittsburgh, 23-10.
 
               CHRIS BERMAN continues with the scores as -- a PENCIL runs down 
               BRANDON'S betting sheet -- checking off results -- loss --  loss 
               -- loss -- loss -- loss -- the pencil pauses -- suddenly snaps 
               from the pressure of the person's hand and -- WALTER stares at 
               BRANDON, seated on the sofa, watching the tvs.  It's obvious 
               they're getting killed. 
 
                                     BRANDON
               I'm gonna go work out.

                                     WALTER
               Sit down!  You're watching every game!  Every second of every 
               minute of every game!  Don't even think of leaving!
 

               INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - NIGHT


               All but one tv is dark.  The last game ends and a remote control 
               suddenly shatters the screen.  WALTER paces the office.  BRANDON 
               still on the sofa.  No one else in the room.  A wall clock reads 
               12:19 AM.  WALTER picks up BRANDON'S betting sheet, holds it 
               like a dead fish.
 
                                     WALTER
               ... How do you go 3 and 11?  Wanna know how -- you make Sunday's 
               picks on Tuesday!  It rained in Cincinatti!  Two starting QBs 
               didn't play!  You're a handicapper, not a psychic! 
 
                                     BRANDON
               There's still Monday night and the parlay.

                                     WALTER
               Fuck Monday night!  Fuck the parlay! 

               You were pissed at me, right?  The commission thing?

                                     BRANDON
               I don't know.

                                     WALTER
               You fucked with me, right?  Joke's on me, right?  The money thing. 
                Okay, I think we're on dangerous ground here but I'm giving 
               you a bump, 10 percent.  Now what about Monday night's game? 
                You want to look over that pick?  Because everyone's gonna double 
               down to climb out of the fucking hole you put 'em in.
 
                                     BRANDON
               Monday night's fine.

                                     WALTER
               You'd bet your mother's house on it?

                                     BRANDON
               I don't bet.

                                     WALTER
               If you did?

                                     BRANDON
               I like the pick, Walter.

                                     WALTER
               On your mother's house or not?

                                     BRANDON
               With my mother in it.


               INT. UPPER EAST SIDE BAR - NIGHT


               Up-scale.  BRANDON sits at the end of the rail, empty glasses 
               lined before him, watching a wall TV with the sound off.  Monday 
               Night Football's on.  His glazed expression suggests it's been 
               a long three hours.  PATRONS around him socialize, laugh, enjoy 
               the bar's oasis-like vibe.  But for BRANDON, it's just him and 
               the game as -- a GIRL approaches, big smile.
 
                                     GIRL
               Oh my God -- Brandon!

               BRANDON glances up, quickly goes back to watching the game.
 
               
               Girl

               Oh come on, I know you remember -- two weeks ago, Aqua -- I'm 
               Heather.
 
                                     BRANDON
               (eyes glued to the game)

               Uh-huh.

               Heather

               This is like such a concidence.  I live right around the corner. 
                This is my neighborhood bar.
 
               She sits beside him, signals the bartender.

               Heather 

               Apple martini.

               (back to BRANDON)

               So listen, my office is renting out a loft this weekend, really 
               fun group, it's gonna be a big blow-out, a PR thing -- music, 
               open bar.  Wednesday night, I want you to come, I mean I'd really 
               love to hook up.   
 
               POV BRANDON -- flurry of action on the TV.  Final seconds.  BRANDON 
               lasered on the screen.
 
                                     HEATHER
               (leaning in, laughing)

               Earth to Brandon, you're blowing it.

               The BARTENDER steps in front of the TV to deliver her drink -- 
               BRANDON jumps from his seat so he can see -- flurry of action 
               on the screen -- the game ends -- the final score flashes and--
 
               
                                     BRANDON
               (pounding the bar)

                                     FUCK!
               HEATHER taken aback, pulls away.  

                                     BRANDON
               Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck!!!

               HEATHER quickly leaves.  Other PATRONS react.  BRANDON in his 
               own world of pain.  BARTENDER eyeing him now.  BRANDON throws 
               down the rest of his drink, trying to steady himself.  His beeper 
               suddenly sounds.  He looks and --
 
               WALTER'S NAME scrolls across the screen.  BRANDON wipes the sweat 
               from his brow.  Mind racing.  Trying to understand.  BRANDON's 
               cell phone rings.  He checks the number, picks up --
 
                                     BRANDON
               Denny!  Hey -- yeah, I'm in a bar.... Of course in New York, 
               I own this town.  What's going on -- you okay?... Tonight's game? 
                You took my picks?  How much?...
 
               All of it?  That was for your college you dumb ass!  Denny, I 
               gave you one game -- goddamn it you should have told me you were 
               following my picks! 
 
               (pacing the rail)

               All right, listen.  Does Mom know?... Okay, good.  Don't say 
               anything.  I've got next weekend wired.  I'll win it all back 
               for you and more.  Understand?  Now I'll call you Friday with 
               who to take.  It's all gonna work out.  I gotta go,  talk to 
               you later.     
 
               BRANDON hangs up.  Straightens.  Strides out of the bar and --
 
               

               INT. BRANDON'S OFFICE - DAY


               BRANDON'S a man absorbed.  The office is filled with sports pages 
               from every newspaper in the country.  Injury reports.  Power 
               ratings.  BRANDON studying everything and --
 
                                     QUICK CUTS
               -- A dozen rapid-fire kick-offs fill the SCREEN -- RECEIVERS 
               catch passes, OTHERS drop them spectacularly -- RUNNING BACKS 
               brilliantly juke tackles, score -- QUARTERBACKS are slammed from 
               behind, stripped of the ball -- kicks miss goal posts by inches 
               -- PLAYERS are carried off on stretchers -- footballs sail through 
               RECEIVERS'S hands, their fingers clawing empty air -- scoreboards 
               blink outcomes, stadium lights flare and --
 

               EXT. CHELSEA PIERS - MANHATTAN - NIGHT


               Similar lights illuminate a driving range on the Hudson River.
 
               

               EXT. DRIVING RANGE -- TOP TIER - NIGHT


               BRANDON smacks one to the 250 sign, about to hit another and 
               --  
 
                                     WALTER
               Helluva swing.  Great game.  Sport of kings, right?  Or is that 
               horse racing?  
 
                                     BRANDON
               What are you doing here?

                                     WALTER
               Southie told me where you were.    

                                     BRANDON
               I had to get out.  Clear my head. 

               (teeing one up)

               Well talk to me.  How'd we do?

                                     WALTER
               You haven't seen the scores?

                                     BRANDON
               Nope.  That's how I wanted it.  Just make the picks and get the 
               results later.  
 
                                     WALTER
               Highest sales volume ever.  Take a guess.

                                     BRANDON
               I think we kicked ass.

                                     WALTER
               It was amazing.

                                     BRANDON
               I told you.  Last week was nothing.

               BRANDON smacks a drive, watches it soar --

                                     WALTER
               You're right, nothing compared to how much we lost today!

                                     BRANDON
               ... What'd I go?

                                     WALTER
               I have an idea.  I give you a few glimpses of what happened here 
               today and you take a stab.
 
                                     BRANDON
               Just give me the numbers, Walter.

                                     WALTER
               You don't like that game.  Too bad.  Woulda been fun.  Grown 
               men crying on the phone.  Wives screaming in the background. 
                Three salespeople quit 'cause they couldn't take the pressure! 
                  
 
                                     BRANDON
               Fuck!

                                     WALTER
               No.  When you lose 10 out of 12, fuck doesn't quite cover it. 
                What would be more appropriate is something like "Holy Fucking 
               Shit!" Or "My Fucking God."  Or "Jesus Fucking Christ!"
 
                                     BRANDON
               Enough.  I get the idea, Walter.

                                     WALTER
               You're right.  I mean 2 for 12 on our biggest volume weekend 
               -- what the hell's left to say?  Except maybe keep the phone 
               number and switch it over to a fucking suicide hotline!
 
               BRANDON hefts the golf bag, walks away.  Yelling after him -- 
               
 
                                     WALTER
               Tomorrow morning, Brandon!  Bright and early!  We start in all 
               over again!  No getting off!  I'm gonna ride you until you're 
               more sick of me than losing!  Turn it around and we avoid a lot 
               of pain!
 
               Omit

                                     OMIT
               Omit

               Omit


               EXT. BROOKLYN PARK - EARLY MORNING


               Gloomy fog.  A few PEOPLE heading home from work.  BRANDON riding 
               his bike, pedaling fast when a MAN suddenly steps out, flash 
               of something in his hand, jamming it in the spokes and --BRANDON 
               wipes out, over the handlebars -- hard to the ground --
 
                                     BRANDON
               Son of a bitch... What the fuck--

                                     BODYGUARD
               Mr. Novian wants to see you.  Now.

                                     BRANDON
               (seeing a gun in his waistband)

               ... Tell him to call.

                                     BODYGUARD
               You tell him.

               BRANDON looks, sees NOVIAN nearby.

                                     NOVIAN
               I didn't recognize you without the suit, John.

                                     BRANDON
               This is my time off.  It's how I clear my head.  You want to 
               talk, pick a time.
 
                                     NOVIAN
               Or should I call you Brandon?  Someone costs you 18 mill, you 
               do some research.
 
               I know more than your name, Brandon.  I know where you're from. 
                Where your family lives.  Hell, I just came from Vegas.  Your 
               Mom, sweet lady... dealt me three blackjacks in a row.
 
               (stepping close)

               Where's the cocky motherfucker who came to my house?

                                     BRANDON
               I'm leaving.

               The BODYGUARD grabs his arm.  Iron grip.

                                     NOVIAN
               Feel that?  I hate the cold.  Winter's coming.  Water's getting 
               rough.
 
                                     BRANDON
               What the fuck is this about?  If you don't like my picks, use 
               someone else.
 
                                     NOVIAN
               Oh, I'm not using you again.  That's already decided.  And I 
               can't get my money back.  It's gone.  No, I came for an apology.
 
               
               The BODYGUARD holds him tight.  Light fading.  No one around.
 
               
                                     NOVIAN
               Look me in the eye and say you're sorry. Say it so as to make 
               me believe you mean it.
 
               Cold gust.  NOVIAN closes the distance between them.

                                     BRANDON
               You flew to New York for--

                                     NOVIAN
               --That's right.

                                     BRANDON
               ... I'm sorry.

                                     NOVIAN
               I don't accept it.  Not good enough.  Try again.

                                     BRANDON
               I don't know what you want me to say.  I'm sorry.  I am.  I'm 
               very sorry.
 
                                     NOVIAN
               Pathetic.

                                     BRANDON
               I am very, very sorry.  That's a lot of money.

                                     NOVIAN
               Not even close.

                                     BRANDON
               I'm sorry!

                                     NOVIAN
               This isn't going to work.  I'll have to get satisfaction somehow 
               else.
 
                                     BRANDON
               Look, I'm not it -- I...

               NOVIAN inches from BRANDON.  Unbuttons his coat.  Sound of a 
               zipper.  BRANDON glances down, sees Novian reach into his fly. 
                BRANDON jumps.  The BODYGUARD holds him.  NOVIAN comes close. 
                BRANDON struggles, very unsure where this might be going and--
 
               
               He squirms -- enduring something -- trickling water heard -- 
               NOVIAN staring right at BRANDON -- finishes pissing on BRANDON'S 
               leg.  NOVIAN motions his BODYGUARD to let go and the men walk 
               off.  BRANDON stands there.  Alone in the gloom and --
 

               INT. STUDIO PRODUCTION SET - NIGHT


               WALTER, BRANDON, JERRY and CHUCK at the desk, waiting for the 
               weekly taping to start.  WALTER jots notes.  JERRY leans over. 
               
 
                                     JERRY
               I scored you the new mikes, Walter.  No wires to mess with.  
               What do you think?
 
                                     WALTER
               I'm busy.  

                                     JERRY
               Listen, I think I should lead off.  I have some really strong 
               stuff.
 
                                     WALTER
               You got a good hole, Jerry.  Stay in it. 

                                     JERRY
               C'mon, I went 8 for 12 last weekend.  I'm hot.  I'm feeling it.
 
               
               WALTER doesn't respond, continues working.  JERRY fumes. 

                                     TECHNICIAN
               60 seconds.

                                     JERRY
               What am I, wood?  

                                     WALTER
               You got one good weekend under your belt, don't push it. 

                                     JERRY
               One weekend?  The Sykes System revolutionized this industry. 
               
 
               (pulling a newspaper, showing a full-page ad for JOHN ANTHONY)
 
               
               Explain something to me, where's my fucking ad?

                                     WALTER
               Take a hike.

                                     JERRY
               What?

                                     WALTER
               You heard me.  You're fired.  Goodbye.

                                     JERRY
               I'm not fired, you need me more than ever.

                                     WALTER
               Beat it, you cut-rate parasite!

                                     JERRY
               In six years my worst weekend was never as bad as any of his 
               last three weeks!
 
                                     WALTER
               Get out!  You don't work for me anymore!

                                     JERRY
               What the hell are you doing, Walter?    C'mon, man -- it's me, 
               Jerry.  These other guys come and go.  
 
                                     WALTER
               (pointing at BRANDON)

               Not this one!  That's true talent!  I'm firing your ass 'cause 
               you don't see it and I can't explain it to you! 
 
                                     JERRY
               Think what you're fucking doing!

                                     WALTER
               I am!  You couldn't pick your fucking nose without a computer! 
                You're small!  You belong in a can!  Show some self-respect! 
                It's over, Jerry -- leave!   
 
               Beat.  BRANDON watches as JERRY gathers his things, walks off.
 
               
                                     WALTER
               ... Fuck him where he flosses.  Asshole doesn't understand I'm 
               building an empire around you.  Finish the countdown, we got 
               a big weekend to get to!  Let's go, chop chop!
 

               INT. BRANDON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT


               A BUDWEISER COMMERCIAL fills FRAME --

               PULL BACK TO SHOW -- BRANDON in bed, under the covers, peeking 
               at the tv over a remote.  The sports wrap-up comes on, scores 
               flashing on the screen.  No clue how he did until his phone rings. 
                Then his cell vibrates.  BRANDON gets out of bed.  Fully dressed. 
                Buries the phone under the mattress.  He turns off the cell, 
               but within seconds it starts vibrating again.  BRANDON sinks 
               into a corner.  Knock at the door.  BRANDON doesn't move.  Another 
               knock and --
 
               Intercut -- toni in the hall, talking through the door

                                     TONI
               It's me, Brandon.  Can I come in?

                                     BRANDON
               No.  It's not a good time.  What do you need?

                                     TONI
               I need to talk to you, it's important.

               BRANDON lost, doesn't answer.    

                                     TONI
               You need to get out, Brandon.  You need to go.  

                                     BRANDON
               I gotta pick a winner is what I gotta do.  I gotta get back on 
               track.
 
                                     TONI
               It won't matter.  You could go 100-and-0 and it won't be enough 
               -- it'll never be enough.  He'll ride you into the ground.
 
               
                                     BRANDON
               I gotta figure this out.

                                     TONI
               Please, Brandon.

                                     BRANDON
               I'll figure it out...

               TONI leans her head against the door, exasperated, spent and--
 
               

               EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE - MANHATTAN - NIGHT


               BRANDON, suit and tie, stands in the lobby of an apartment high-rise, 
               speaks on a house phone.  An unsmiling DOORMAN watches nearby.
 
               
                                     BRANDON VOICEOVER
               Alex, it's Brandon.  Hey, it's been awhile but I never got your 
               number that night.  I was in the neighborhood so I thought I'd 
               take a chance and stop by.  
 

               INT. LUXURY HIGH-RISE APARTMENT BUILDING - LOBBY - NIGHT


               The DOORMAN stands at the entrance, watches BRANDON wait.  ALEX 
               appears, beautiful as the night BRANDON picked her up in the 
               restaurant.  Her demeanor, however, is far from friendly as she 
               exits the elevator.
 
                                     BRANDON
               Man, you got a Doberman for a doorman.

                                     ALEX
               What are you doing here?

                                     BRANDON
               I came by to take you out for a late dinner and a couple of killer 
               bottles of wine.  C'mon.  We'll go back to that place where we 
               met.   
 
                                     ALEX
               Are you out of your fucking mind?

               (stepping close for emphasis)

               I live in this building, asshole.  It's home.  I don't like creeps 
               coming around unannounced.  Lurking around outside.  
 
                                     BRANDON
               What the hell's gotten into you?  What about that night?

                                     ALEX
               Let me make this real clear so this shit doesn't happen again. 
                You mean nothing to me.  Oh wait, I take that back -- you meant 
               5000 bucks.  Your friend set it up.
 
               (already heading back inside)

               Don't fucking bother me again.


               EXT. MANHATTAN - DAWN


               Pale sunrise over the East River.


               INT. SALES ROOM - DAWN


               BRANDON, suit and tie, walks through the silent, empty room. 
                
 

               INT. BRANDON'S OFFICE - DAWN


               BRANDON sits at his desk.  Staring out at the city.  His phone 
               rings.  Again.  Again.  Finally pressing speaker phone -- 
 
               
                                     BRANDON
               Hello.

               Intercut - amir in payphone beside N.J. Turnpike - dawn

               Amir

               (dishevelled, distraught)

               I'm wiped out, John... 

                                     BRANDON
               Amir?

               Amir

               My business... My house... My credit...

                                     BRANDON
               No, now listen to me -- we got a big weekend coming up, buddy 
               --
 
                                     AMIR
               Still you talk like this.  Who the fuck are you, like this is 
               some kind of game.  I was betting a few thousand a Sunday when 
               I called you.  You pushed me.  Every call.  All the time with 
               your talk... I lost $380,000 this weekend... I was going to get 
               married... I had a life... 
 
               BRANDON staring at the phone, barely holding it together, sees 
               TAMMY standing there -- holding the day's newspapers, hearing 
               the conversation on speaker.
 
                                     AMIR
               No words now, huh?  No more money to squeeze so you shut up. 
                How do you fucking live with yourself?  
 
               Click.  Amir hangs up.  Crushing beat.  TAMMY staring at him.
 
               
                                     BRANDON
               What?

               (face hardening)

               Fuck him if he can't take a joke.

               TAMMY puts the day's newspapers on his desk, leaves.  BRANDON 
               glances down, something catches his eye.  BRANDON pulls a newspaper 
               from the pile -- finds himself staring at a full-page ad for 
               JOHN ANTHONY.  Big smile.  Copy advertising "The Million Dollar 
               Man!" and -- 
 

               INT. BRANDON'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING


               BRANDON paces the dim space.  Sits on the bench press.  Leans 
               back on the board.  He stares up at the weights.  Moves the weight 
               pin to 250... and slowly starts to lift.  One rep.  Two.  Three. 
                Four.  A bad of sweat forms.  BRANDON throws off the jacket. 
                Pulls off the tie.  Removes his shirt and shoes.  He resumes 
               lifting, grim determination -- the weights rising over and over 
               and over -- faster and faster and --
 

               INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - MORNING


               BRANDON, t-shirt and sweats, approaches WALTER'S office, bursts 
               through the door --
 
                                     BRANDON
               I know what the problem is!

               BRANDON freezes.  WALTER watches two MEN unload stacks of money 
               from a briefcase, pile them on his desk. 
 
                                     BRANDON
               I'll come back later.

                                     WALTER
               No!  C'mon in.  We're done here.  Right fellas?  All through? 
                You want a bite before you go?  Something to drink? 
 
               The two MEN leave.  WALTER lights a cigarette.

                                     BRANDON
               Who were they?

                                     WALTER
               We need a bat light or something, you know a signal I can shoot 
               up at the
 
                                     
               Walter con'd

               clouds and no matter where you are you 

               can look up and you'll know I need you.  Maybe that would work. 
                'Cause last night I must've beeped you a hundred times.
 
                                     BRANDON
               Who were they?

                                     WALTER
               They're from the Salvation Army.  How the hell does someone go 
               1-for-8?  A fucking monkey tossing darts could do better!
 
                                     BRANDON
               What's with the money, Walter?

                                     WALTER
               1-for-fucking-8!

               (coming around the desk)

               I have a plan.  From now on we take your picks and reverse everything! 
                Like a Twilight Zone episode where everything's the opposite! 
                You say black we go white!  A is B!  Lose becomes win!
 
                                     BRANDON
               (staring at the pile of cash)

               How much is that?

                                     WALTER
               (sweeping the pile to the floor)

               How much is what?  Oh, that -- 275,000 dollars! 

                                     BRANDON
               What happened to the two mill, all the other money?

                                     WALTER
               I was carrying twice that in red ink before you showed up.  The 
               last few weeks I thought keep the pressure off.  He'll come around. 
                Climb out on his own.  Now I figure fuck it!  Time to turn on 
               the lights!  Let him see the toilet he's drowning us all in! 
                Maybe that'll shake him up!  So what do you want to know?  I 
               got three mortgages on this house, I'm gambling again and to 
               cover my losses I just got a loan from a guy who works out of 
               a bar on a 106th and Broadway!  All this -- everything you see 
               around you -- 
 
               is smoke and mirrors!  I shoulda been a magician!

                                     
                                     WALTER CON'D
               ... What'd you say when you came in?  You    were in a good mood 
               when you walked through the door and you said something.
 
                                     BRANDON
               You're betting my picks?

                                     WALTER
               You went 82 and 11!  You were picking 80 percent -- how could 
               I fucking not!?  Trouble is I bet heavy after you went a hundred 
               percent and rode you right into the fucking toilet!  One decent 
               weekend and I would have been set for life!  One decent weekend! 
                
 
               BRANDON stares at him, stunned.

                                     WALTER
               "I know what the problem is!"  That's it!  You came in with a 
               big smile and said, "I know what the problem is!"
 
                                     BRANDON
               ... I'm Brandon Lang, Walter.  Brandon's the one who played sports. 
                Brandon's the one who can pick games.  I lost touch with him 
               -- myself.  It wasn't an act, man.  I became John Anthony.  But 
               he's not me.  If I go back to being Brandon--
 
                                     WALTER
               --You can pick again!  Of course!

               All you gotta do is go back to being Brandon!  Talk like Brandon! 
                Eat like Brandon!  Forget John Anthony!  Burn the suits!  It's 
               all my fault.  I see that now.  I pushed you into something you 
               weren't.  I took the golden goose and tried to turn it into a 
               duck.  We're winding down the season.  There's only two games 
               this weekend.  Two winners and two over/unders.  That's all we 
               need.  You crunch the numbers, sprinkle in a little Brandon magic, 
               we get the sales people burning up the phones and come Monday 
               we go four for four going into the big game!  Right?  Huh?  Let's 
               get
 
               something to eat!  Go to Smith and Wo's!

                                     BRANDON
               No thanks.  I'll stay here.  Eat light.

                                     WALTER
               (kneeling down, stacking the cash)

               The Brandon thing!  What am I thinking trying to get you to go 
               out?  What would Brandon eat for lunch?  Peanut butter and jelly? 
                Ramen noodles?  What?
 
                                     BRANDON
               (on the floor, helping him)

               I'll get something.

                                     WALTER
               You want anything shipped from home?  Your bed?  Clothes?  Porno 
               collection?
 
                                     BRANDON
               No, I'm fine.

                                     WALTER
               Blow job?

                                     BRANDON
               Thanks anyway.  Maybe later...

                                     WALTER
               Because it's important.

                                     BRANDON
               Pressure doesn't help.

                                     WALTER
               God forgive me, you're an artist.  I fucked with that.  Two little 
               winners and a couple of over/unders.  That's all we need.  You 
               could phone it in.  Two's nothing.  Not for you.  Not for Brandon. 
                Right, Brandon?  Isn't that right?
 
               BRANDON stands.  Looks down at WALTER, unable to hide the desperation 
               behind his frozen smile and --
 
               MONTAGE OF BRANDON WORKING THROUGH THE WEEk

               --BRANDON closes the blinds in his office, blocks the view --BRANDON 
               works out, watching ESPN -- the SALES STAFF sit idle at their 
               desks, playing cards -- a pick sheet fills FRAME,  shows New 
               York versus Atlanta, Tenessee versus Kansas City and an over/under 
               beneath each game -- WALTER waits in the SALES ROOM, edgy, pacing 
               when BRANDON emerges holding the sheet -- all eyes on him -- 
               WALTER approaches --
 
                                     WALTER
               These are the winners?

                                     BRANDON
               That's who I like.

                                     WALTER
               Brandon made these picks?

                                     BRANDON
               You're looking at him.

                                     WALTER
               (regarding the picks, to the room)

               New York and the under, Tenessee and the under!  Sell 'em hard!
 
               

               INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - DAY


               SALES STAFF crowd into the room.  WALTER and BRANDON sit side-by-side. 
                Seconds before kickoff of the New York/Atlanta game.  JULIA 
               climbs into WALTER'S lap, holding her puppy.
 
               Julia

               Can I watch, daddy?

                                     WALTER
               Sure, Angel.  I need you to root for me.

               (pointing at ATLANTA)

               They're the bad guys.  Atlanta.  We want the blue team.  New 
               York.  They have to win by more than five points.  And root for 
               a low score.  Both teams have to make less than 42 points total. 
                New York and under 42 points.
 
                                     JULIA
               Why do we like the blue team?

                                     WALTER
               Because Brandon likes them.

               JULIA looks at BRANDON, smiles.  BRANDON'S barely holding up 
               here, forces himself to find a smile in return.
 
               THE TV FILLS FRAME.  New York kicks off.  An Atlanta RECEIVER 
               takes it back for a 60 yard return.  We start cutting from the 
               game to BRANDON, to WALTER, the SALESPEOPLE, JULIA, all reacting 
               as the betting Gods raise hopes one play, dash them the next. 
                Play after play.  Tide going for New York one minute, Atlanta 
               the next.  Tension in the room building. Everyone crowds the 
               TVs as New York defends a 10 point lead with a minute left.  
               37 points on the board.  Only an Atlanta TD can lose the two 
               bets and they're 80 yards from scoring.  A few high fives as 
               Atlanta fumbles on a run, recover the ball for a five yard loss. 
                Backed up to their own end zone.  Two plays left.  WALTER excited, 
               things going their way and --
 
               BRANDON starting to breath again and -- Atlanta tries a final 
               hail mary, ball coming down into a crowd -- time runs out as 
               a New York PLAYER swats it and an Atlanta RECEIVER pulls it down 
               -- running hard -- open to the end zone -- the room freezes -- 
               a New York PLAYER grabs hold -- trying to bring him the bastard 
               down but the Atlanta RUNNER is strong and just makes it in for 
               the score -- game over -- and Atlanta hasn't won but they've 
               killed the point spread and pushed the game over -- nobody speaks 
               -- the second game comes on right on the heels of the first and 
               now Tennessee is kicking off to Kansas City and we're on the 
               roller coaster all over again -- SALES PEOPLE start drifting 
               from the room and they've pushed their clients huge on these 
               games and their cell phones are ringing and WALTER'S just staring 
               at the screens and BRANDON'S dying and --
 
                                     DISSOLVE TO

               INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - LATER - NIGHT


               WALTER and BRANDON alone in the room.  Sound of the ANNOUNCERS 
               as Atlanta get trounced by Denver.  Not even close.  Well over 
               42 total points scored.  The game ends.  All four bets lost. 
                A commercial comes on.  Horrible stillness.  
 
                                     BRANDON
               ...I'm finished.  I'm done.

                                     WALTER
               That's great.

                                     BRANDON
               I can't do this anymore, Walter.  I can't sleep at night.  I 
               can't eat. 
 
                                     WALTER
               You're not gonna sit there and tell me you're ending this because 
               you have a little indigestion or some insomnia.
 
                                     BRANDON
               It's a lot more than that.

                                     WALTER
               I made it very clear before we started what the stakes were. 
                
 
                                     BRANDON
               Walter, it's over.  What use could John Anthony be to you now? 
                Only an idiot would follow him after the streak I've been on.
 
               
                                     WALTER
               Wrong!  Hot streaks go cold, cold streaks go hot.  Bettors will 
               climb back aboard. 
 
                                     
                                     WALTER CON'D
               They know you!  And when your luck turns they'll remember you 
               went 80 percent for half the season!  We'll make it all back 
               on the last game and by next year they'll forget everything.
 
               
                                     BRANDON
               Who said anything about next year?

                                     WALTER
               Sports betting's year-round.

                                     BRANDON
               I'm not doing this next year.

                                     WALTER
               You made a career choice!  I bankrolled it!

                                     TONI VO
               Let him go, Walter.

               WALTER and BRANDON turn, see TONI at the door.

                                     WALTER
               Of course you stick up for him!

                                     TONI
               Meaning what?

                                     WALTER
               Who's side are you on?

                                     TONI
               I didn't realize I had to choose.

                                     WALTER
               (to BRANDON)

               Look, you got a magnificent gift.  Own that.  So you strike out 
               sometimes, big deal, you're swinging for the fences.  You're 
               a champion, Brandon.  A champion goes down 186 times but gets 
               up 187.  I'm not letting you stay down.  This isn't about you 
               or me or Toni, this transcends that -- this is metaphysical, 
               this is cosmic, this is eternal -- this is God... Besides, we 
               have a contract.
 
                                     BRANDON
               Bullshit!  

                                     TONI
               You can't own someone, Walter.

                                     WALTER
               I created the hottest sports tout this country's ever seen!  
               I plugged him, took out full page ads, built a show around him, 
               hooked him up with every major client I have and I will be goddamned 
               if he's going to walk out the door and take all that with him! 
                Why the hell am I even explaining this to you!  This is between 
               me and him!  Get out!
 
                                     BRANDON
               Don't talk to her like that.

                                     WALTER
               I need you to tell me how to talk to my wife?  When I'm talking 
               you'll shut your fucking toilet!
 
                                     TONI
               (to BRANDON)

               Leave.


               INT. WALTER AND TONI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT


               BRANDON comes down the hall.  TONI and WALTER heard yelling through 
               the office door.  BRANDON hesitates, walks out and --
 

               INT. BRANDON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT


               Dim darkness.  A distant siren bleeds in as --

                                     WALTER'S VOICE
               Brandon... Brandon.

               BRANDON'S POV.  His eyes open.  WALTER'S face fills FRAME.

                                     WALTER
               Wake up.

                                     BRANDON
               What time is it?

                                     WALTER
               Five in the morning.  Listen, I gotta fly to Vegas to meet with 
               some clients.  Hand holding thing.  Keep 'em on board for the 
               final game.  Because you can do this thing, Brandon.  End of 
               the season's the perfect place to turn this streak around.  I'll 
               be back to you out to dinner.  Get you back in the groove.  9:30. 
                Nobu. Gotta catch my flight.  See you tonight.  Look sharp. 
                We're turning it around.
 
               WALTER backs out, kills the lights.  Darkness returns and --
 
               

               INT. NOBU - NIGHT


               BRANDON alone at a table, sipping a sake when TONI, evening dress, 
               sits next to him.
 
                                     BRANDON
               Hey, I didn't know you were coming.

                                     TONI
               Walter was delayed, he's coming back in the morning.  Asked if 
               I'd fill in.  
 
                                     BRANDON
               (processing this)

               That's funny, he didn't call me.  You look great.

               TONI silent.

               BRAndon

               You okay?

                                     TONI
               Julia did her ballet recital today.  God she was beautiful.
 
               
                                     BRANDON
               She is.

               TONi

               ... He's betting again.  

               BRANDON regards her.

                                     TONI
               I can't believe I'm here again.  I saw it coming.  I just... 
               I just couldn't stop it.
 
                                     BRANDON
               Nobody could.

                                     TONI
               He won't stop on his own.  He can't.

                                     BRANDON
               I gotta win one more game.

                                     TONI
               You can't fix this, Brandon.

               BRANDOn

               After Sunday's game I'm taking off...


               EXT. BROWNSTONE STEPS - NIGHT


               A cab pulls up.  BRANDON and TONI emerge.  BRANDON looks around 
               as they start up the steps.  Both reach for their keys, regard 
               one another.
 
                                     BRANDON
               It's still early.  Come in for a while.

                                     TONI
               I don't think so. 

               She leans in to kiss him on the cheek and -- BRANDON suddenly 
               shifts.  Their lips meet.  A casual goodbye suddenly grows in 
               intensity as neither tries to part.  Seconds ticking by.  Things 
               getting heated.  TONI tries to pull away.
 
                                     TONI
               Brandon--

               BRANDON comes close, whispers something.  He unlocks the door. 
               She hesitates before BRANDON takes her hand, leads her into his 
               dark apartment and --
 

               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - SAME TIME


               A cold wind blows off the river.  Whips through the cables of 
               the span.  A match flares.  WALTER'S face is lit briefly by the 
               flame.  He stands on the bridge walkway, looking down at the 
               brownstone and --

               INT. WALTER AND TONI'S APARTMENT - DAY


               WALTER'S FACE fills a shaky HOME VIDEO VIEWFINDER, video coming 
               close to show WALTER opening a book-size present -- removing 
               a beautifully framed photo of TONI and JULIA.   
 
                                     WALTER
               Look at that.  With the leaves and all.  This goes on my desk. 
                
 
               Quick PAN to TONI -- sitting near the fireplace, fire blazing. 
               
 
                                     TONI
               Happy anniversary.

               KNOCK at the door --

               JULIA vo

               I'll get it.

               JULIA hands the CAMERA to WALTER.  VIDEO CAMERA view of JULIA 
               and the puppy running to the door, opening it and --
 
                                     JULIA
               Brandon!

                                     BRANDON
               Hey darlin'.

               Walter vo

               There he is.  C'mon in.  We're having a little celebration.  
               Toni and I were married 12 years ago today.     
 
                                     BRANDON
               Congratulations, I didn't know. 

               WALTER vo

               Sit down.  I want you to be part of this.  

               Okay angel, give Mommy my gift.

               WALTER aims the CAMERA as JULIA hands TONI a small gift box. 
                TONI opens it, reveals a set of very expensive earrings.  
 
               
               Toni

               Walter... 

               WALTER vo

               Relax, I had some saved.  Put 'em on, lemme see.    

               TONI puts the earrings on.

               Walter vo

               Beautiful.  God I got good taste.

               TONI stares into the CAMERA as WALTER PANS to BRANDON --

               WALTER vo

               I saw something else, I couldn't help myself.  Here, Brandon 
               -- for you.
 
               WALTER hands BRANDON a small black case.  BRANDON unsure, looks 
               at TONI, opens it -- produces a very expensive watch.
 
               WALTER vo

               It's a Chopard.  Designed for car racing.  Guy won six times 
               at LeMans wearing it.       Put it on, maybe you'll start winning. 
               
 
                                     BRANDON
               I can't take this.

               WALTER vo

               Why not?

                                     BRANDON
               It's too much.

               WALTER vo

               For what?  You're family, Brandon.  We all love each other, right? 
                I'm like a father, you're like my son -- gee, sorry Toni, but 
               I guess that makes you his mother.
 
               WALTER PANS to TONI, staring at the fire.  Strained silence.
 
               
               WALTER vo

               What?  Somebody fart or something?

               TONI starts taking off the earrings.

               WALTER vo

               Leave 'em on.

                                     TONI
               They're for evening.

               WALTER vo

               Good, wear 'em to bed tonight.

               (VIDEO CAMERA back on BRANDON) 

               Who do you think'll win the big game? 

                                     BRANDON
               Turn it off.

               WALTEr/still taping

               Better yet, don't say anything.  Surprise me.  We'll break it 
               when we do the live show.  Take your time, Brandon.  Enjoy yourself. 
                Give Walter a smile.

               INT. BRANDON'S APARTMENT - DAY


               BRANDON surrounded by a sea of sports pages, comentary, ratings. 
                He looks up at a blaring TV and --
 
               THE TV FILLS FRAME -- TIME CUT as various sports shows come on 
                back-to-back -- each providing a wealth of competing Superbowl 
               predictions and analysis.  
 
               CAMERA TIGHTENS ON THE SCREEN AND WE SEE, for every hopped-up 
               SPORTSCASTER who picks Denver, an equally assured COUNTERPART 
               chooses New York.  One after another.  No consensus at all. Airwaves 
               awash in past-season stats -- regular season stats -- post-season 
               stats -- all of it blending into an overwhelming, mind-numbing, 
               jarring blather of pure disagreement and --   
 

               INT. TV PRODUCTION STUDIO BATHROOM - NIGHT


               BRANDON, suit and tie, splashes water on his face, stares at 
               himself in the mirror.  He pulls reams of stats and newspaper 
               reports from his pocket, regards the Superbowl pick sheet.  Blank 
               space for the winner.  Blank space for the over/under.  BRANDON 
               fumbling with his sheets of data, desperately searching for an 
               answer when he suddenly hurls it all in the trash.  Kicks the 
               can.  Kicks it again.  
 
                                     TECHNICIAN'S VOICE
               60 seconds till we go live, Mr. Anthony!

               BRANDON looks over.  The unfinished pick sheet lies crumpled 
               by the toilet.  He smooths it.  Pulls a coin.
 
                                     BRANDON
               Heads, New York.  Tails Denver.

               He flips the coin.  Palms it.  Heads.  BRANDON checks the box.
 
               
                                     BRANDON
               Heads, over.  Tails, under.

               BRANDON flips again, lets the coin hit the floor, watches it 
               spin, slowly come to a stop, drop to its side and --
 

               INT. TV PRODUCTION STUDIO - NIGHT


               BRANDON sits at the set.  Looks over at CHUCK, in his own world, 
               working something from his teeth.  BRANDON Slides the pick sheet 
               to WALTER.

               BRANDON'S face fills the monitor.  Completely off-guard.

                                     BRANDON
               ... Wow.  What an offer.  The phones'll be flooded.

                                     WALTER
               We're that sure!  John, rundown the pitfalls facing the average 
               bettor.  I mean a game this huge, all the added dynamics, without 
               your expertise most bettors might as well just... flip a coin, 
               am I right?
 
                                     BRANDON
               (tapping into it)

               That's right, Walter!  Last game of the year ladies and gentlemen! 
                Come Sunday you're either ending the season a winner or a loser!

                And I am absolutely, 1000-percent sure that I, John Anthony, 
               will end the season ahead of the game!

               The studio doors open.  WALTER exits.  BRANDON right beside.
 
               
                                     BRANDON
               You can't guarantee they'll win!  It's insane!

                                     WALTER
               You think?  Well I say if you can flip a coin to pick, I can 
               guarantee the game!
 
                                     BRANDON
               What if you lose?

                                     WALTER
               Fuck it, I'm ruined anyway.

                                     BRANDON
               At least cap it out!

                                     BRANDON
               I don't know what you're talking about.

                                     WALTER
               I think you do.  The best part of the best drug in the world 
               isn't the high.
 
               The best part is the time just before you take it!  The dice 
               are dancing on the
 
               table.  Between now when they stop -- that's the greatest high 
               in the world!

               INT. BRANDON'S OFFICE - DAY


               BRANDON, suit and tie, looks through the glass at the feeding 
               frenzy.  He closes the blinds.  Goes to the closet.  Hangs up 
               his jacket.  Removes his tie and --
 

               INT. SALES OFFICE - NIGHT


               Kick-off is seconds away.  WALTER and the SALES STAFF gather 
               around the set, turn up the sound.
 
                                     1ST TV ANNOUNCER
               New York wins the toss and elects to receive.

                                     2ND ANNOUNCER
               Some bettor somewhere just made some money.

                                     WALTER
               That's it!  No more calls!  Kill the phones!  Kill 'em now -- 
               right now!
 
               The ringing stops.  All eyes on game as the two teams line up 
               for kick-off.  WALTER before the tv.  Laughing with SALESMEN. 
               
 

               INT. BRANDON'S OFFICE - SAME TIME - NIGHT


               TONI alone.  View across the hall into the office.  BRANDON enters, 
               wearing his UNLV jacket and faded jeans.
 
                                     TONI
               (to BRANDON, re: WALTER)

               Look at him.  Dead man walking, should be getting last rites. 
                Hours away from losing everything, but Walter -- he's having 
               the time of his life.
 
                                     BRANDON
               Maybe he thinks he already did lose everything.

               WALL OF TVS, the ball's kicked and the game begins -- the SALESROOM 
               explodes in cheers after a good play -- PLAYERS collide -- a 
               fumble bounces across the field -- SALESMEN clamber atop desks 
               for a better view -- WALTER in agony after an interception, a 
               moment later elated when a flag brings the play back -- the score 
               board FILLS FRAME, New York trails 14/7 at the half and --
 
               
               PULL BACK TO SHOW -- the tension level in the room is suddenly 
               suspended.  We're in the eye of the storm.  WALTER like a fighter 
               between rounds.  BRANDON appears.
 
                                     WALTER
               Hold onto that coin you flipped.  Game keeps up like this I'll 
               have to borrow it.
 
                                     BRANDON
               It's not over yet, Walter.  I wouldn't change my bet.


               INT. BRANDON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT


               BRANDON packs things into a duffel bag.  The Superbowl's on tv. 
                The sound's off.  Play's resumed.  BRANDON removes the watch. 
                Sets it on a nightstand beside an envelope and the Mercedes 
               keys.  Picks up a plane ticket and --
 

               EXT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT


               BRANDON comes down the steps, carrying his bag, dressed the same 
               as the day he came.  BRANDON starts down the sidewalk.  Flags 
               a cab.  It stops.  He opens the door, about to get in when a 
               cheer from the SALES ROOM makes him look up and --
 
               POV BRANDON -- TONI looks down from a window.  Frozen beat.  
               She turns away.  BRANDON climbs in the cab, drives off and --
 
               

               INT. SALES OFFICE - NIGHT


               Fourth quarter.  Superbowl blaring from the tv.  New York's driving. 
                Minutes left.  The SALES STAFF are screaming at the set, climbing 
               over each other to get a better view and New York suddenly scores 
               and the room erupts and WALTER'S right in the middle of it, looks 
               around --
 
                                     WALTER
               Where the hell's Brandon?


               INT. BRANDON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT


               The door's ajar.  WALTER rushes in.

                                     WALTER
               You're missing the game!  We're back in it!  A New York touchdown 
               and we win both bets!
 
               Walter walks back to the bedroom.  The tv's on.  WALTER pauses 
               to watch another play, about to leave when he spies the Rolex 
               on the nightstand, envelope beside it.  WALTER picks up the letter. 
                Sees his name on the outside.  He opens it, reads. TONI appears 
               in the BG.  WALTER turns.
 
                                     WALTER
               ... He left.

                                     TONI
               I know.

                                     WALTER
               And you didn't you tell me?

                                     TONI
               He asked me not to.

                                     WALTER
               Just like that?  No goodbye?

                                     TONI
               I'm sure it's in the letter.

                                     WALTER
               I'm sure it is... I wonder what's not in here?

                                     TONI
               What do you mean?

                                     WALTER
               What do you mean, what do I mean?  When it comes to Brandon you 
               seem to have all the answers.
 
                                     TONI
               He had enough.  He wanted his life back.

                                     WALTER
               He said that to you?

                                     TONI
               Yeah, loud and clear, by leaving.

                                     WALTER
               I think it's something else.

                                     TONI
               Yeah, tell me.

                                     WALTER
               You know.

                                     TONI
               No.

               ON -- the TV.  New York's driving.  Game reaching a head.  A 
               clock in the corner counts down the final two minutes.
 
                                     WALTER
               You have no idea, huh?

                                     TONI
               You're missing the game.

                                     WALTER
               No I'm not.  This is the game.

               BRANDON travels down an escalator and --


               INT. BRANDON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 


               TONI at the door.  WALTER approaches.

                                     WALTER
               Something was bothering him.  I mean sure, maybe he was homesick. 
                Or I was thinking maybe he had such, you know, deep feelings 
               for me he couldn't face saying goodbye.  What a minute.  I just 
               
 
               thought of something.  Just came to me.  Out of the blue.  What 
               about this?  Maybe Brandon left without telling me because --
 
               
               (full volume, in her face)

               You let him fuck you!

               ON -- TV.  A New York RECEIVER catches a long bomb.  Nailed at 
               the 20.  Clock down to a minute 30.  No time to huddle and --
 
               
                                     WALTER
               Do you deny it?

                                     TONI
               Do I have to?

                                     WALTER
               I know you did!  

                                     TONI
               Really?  Another "lock of the year?"

                                     WALTER
               I saw you, Toni!  I saw you go into his room that night!  This 
               room!  With him!  I never went to Vegas!
 

               INT. JFK AIRLINE TERMINAL - NIGHT  


               BRANDON walks through FRAME.  PASSENGERS rush for flights and--
 
               

               INT. BRANDON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT  


               TONI and WALTER in the middle of it --

                                     TONI
               You mean you lied to me about the trip!

                                     WALTER
               Don't talk to me about lying!

                                     TONI
               I guess you had the whole thing planned?

                                     WALTER
               Don't make this about me!

                                     TONI
               Put me out there on a tray!

                                     WALTER
               Yeah, I put the tray out there -- but you didn't have to shove 
               an apple in your mouth and jump on it!  On him!
 
               ON -- New York throws a pass.  Blocked.  45 seconds left --
 
               
                                     WALTER
               Admit it!

                                     TONI
               You played me!

                                     WALTER
               You're damn right I did!

                                     TONI
               ... Brandon was right.  Son of a bitch!

                                     WALTER
               You don't deny it!

                                     TONI
               Best pick he ever made.

                                     WALTER
               What the hell are you talking about?


               INT. JFK AIRPORT BAR - NIGHT


               PASSENGERS watch the Superbowl on a tv over the bar.  Final seconds. 
                BRANDON appears.  Stands outside.  CROWD of people around the 
               set, it looks like the last play and --
 

               INT. BRANDON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 


               TONI before WALTER.  Inches away --

                                     TONI
               You were gambling with me that night, Walter.  Brandon knew it. 
                Knew you.  He told me he was sure you were watching somehow. 
                So he asked me in to spend the night, put on a show.  I didn't 
               believe him -- I mean after all we've been through -- but I figured 
               what the hell.
 
                                     
               Toni con'd

               He slipped out the back,

                                     
                                     TONI CON'D
               didn't even stay here.  And you... you were in such a good mood 
               the next day.  I figured he must have been wrong.  Otherwise 
               why wouldn't you confront us?  Confront me?
 
               CLOSE ON -- TV.  Last play.  No time left.  The New York QUARTERBACK

               INT. SALESROOM - NIGHT


               The room's at fever pitch, everyone screaming at the TV and -- 
               
 

               INT. BRANDON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 


               WALTER still as a statue.  Game in the BG.  TONI rolling --
 
               
                                     TONI
               And now I find out you've been thinking ever since then that 
               we did sleep together?  Living with it like that?  Looking at 
               me like that?  You sick fuck!  You wanted to lose!  You set us 
               up!  Like I was something you just toss on the table!  Only we 
               booked your bet, Walter!
 
               Brandon and me.  The two of us, who evidentally love you more 
               than you love yourself.  Your fantasy's to end up alone with 
               nothing!  Well I won't let that happen to you!  Understand?  
               I will never let that happen!  This is it!  We're all we have, 
               Walter!  All we're ever gonna have!  You and me, we're all that's 
               real!
 
               WALTER stands there, staring at her.  Tears streaming down his

               INT. JFK AIRPORT BAR - NIGHT


               CAMERA on the tv.  Blaring the game.  Bar going crazy as the 
               New York QUARTERBACK runs for the end zone.  Juking LINEMEN. 
                Dodging tackles.  Nearing the goal.  A last-second block clears 
               a lane and the QUARTERBACK barrels by, dives -- a hit -- a fumble 
               on the goal line -- a beat -- a replay -- a REFEREE signaling 
               a touchdown -- and the game's over -- and New York has won, but 
               more importantly they've covered the spread and --
 
               BRANDON walks down the corridor, his cell rings.  Answering -- 
                
 
                                     BRANDON
               It's me.

                                     BRANDON'S DAD
               Hello, Brandon?

                                     BRANDON
               Hey, hey the big winner.  What's going on?

                                     BRANDON'S DAD
               Nothing much... the usual.

                                     BRANDON
               C'mon, I know it's rough, it's supposed to be.  A friend turned 
               me on to the place.  She said it's the best.
 
                                     BRANDON'S DAD
               Where are you headed?

                                     BRANDON
               I don't know, but I got an airport full of planes to choose from. 
               
 
                                     BRANDON'S DAD
               Does your mom know I'm in rehab?

                                     BRANDON
               Yeah, I told her. 

                                     BRANDON'S DAD
               Great pick on New York.  It's like I always said, you don't bet 
               quarterbacks and receivers-- 
 
                                     BRANDON
               (finishing his words)

               --You bet the offensive line.  I remember.  That's exactly what 
               I was thinking about, pop.
 
                                     BRANDON'S DAD
               (excitement creeping in)

               No kidding!  Wow.  Helluva game, huh?  Boy, that opening drive 
               was a beaut, the way they drove like that, six first downs -- 
               you shoulda seen me, Brandon -- I'm screaming at the tv...
 
               
               BRANDON smiles as he listens to his DAD talk.  The loud sound 
               of a jet taking off fills the terminal as BRANDON walks down 
               the corridor and --
 
                                     DISSOLVE TO
               ext. Elementary school playground - day

               A dozen 9-year-old PEE-WEE FOOTBALL PLAYERS, barely able to move 
               in over-sized gear, are lined for practice.  BRANDON, coach's 
               whistle, faces them.
 
                                     BRANDON
               We're up against a tough team today, toughest on our schedule. 
                But you're ready for it.  You're prepared.  Most important I 
               want you to go out there and have some fun.  Enjoy yourselves. 
                Keep it loose.  Because you can't make me any more proud of 
               you than I already am.  Team cheer, bring it in --
 
               The KIDS gather close, thrust their hands in the center --

               Thunderbirds!

                                     BRANDON
               Go get 'em!

               The KIDS scramble across the field, other TEAM seen suited and 
               ready.  PARENTS on the sideline.  One of BRANDON'S tiny TEAMMATES 
               hangs back, approaches BRANDON.
 
                                     TEAMMATE
               You really think we can win today, Coach?

                                     BRANDON
               ... I'd bet on it.

               BRANDON drapes an arm over the KID, walks him to the game --
 
               
               CAMERA lifting higher --

               And higher --

               And that's it.

    ABBY RICHTER, 30's, pretty, driven and absolutely in control,
    walks through the lobby, greeting the SECURITY GUARD.

                        ABBY
              Morning, Freddy.

                        SECURITY GUARD
              Morning, Abby. Another peaceful
              day?

                        ABBY
              If you say so...

    JOY, 40's, the associate producer, falls in step with Abby.

                        JOY
                  (panicked)
              We've got problems.

                         ABBY
              There are no problems, Joy.   Only
              solutions.

                        JOY
              The sky-cam on the traffic copter
              has a cracked lens and they can't
              fix it.

                         ABBY
              Okay, that's a problem.
                (thinking, then...)
              Call Matt Hardwick down at Media
              Services. He's got a few Sky Cams
              and he owes me. Now, where are my
              weathermen?

    Joy opens a door to a waiting area.

    Several portly LATINO MEN look up and wave at Abby.

                 What's with the pot bellies?

                 Research shows people like fat
                 weathermen. It makes them feel
                 safe.

                           ABBY
                 I like the one in the green and the
                 one in the brown, but I want to see
                 the one in the green with less
                 sideburns and the one in the brown
                 with more, then I'll make my
                 decision.

                           LARRY (O.S.)
                 Abby!

    LARRY, 50's, the pompous, uptight anchor man, catches up to
    them. He wears a makeup bib.

                           ABBY
                 Morning, Larry.

                           LARRY
                 I'm sorry to do this to you, Abby,
                 but I don't think I can work with
                 her anymore. It's bad enough I
                 have to take her criticism at home.
                 I can't do it on air, too. A man
                 can only take so much.

    Abby nods, taking him seriously, but you can tell she's done
    this before.

                           ABBY
                 You're not a man, Larry...
                     (off his look)
                 You're a newsman. A newsman isn't
                 defined by the easy times, Larry,
                 he's defined by the difficult ones.
                 Can you imagine Ted Koppel or Chris
                 Hansen or Anderson Cooper having
                 their wives as co-anchor? Hell, no,
                 because they couldn't handle it.
                 But you can. You've got balls the
                 size of Volkswagens. Don't think I
                 haven't noticed.

                  (re his balls)
              I've only thought of them as blue
              as of late, but you're right. They
              are quite sizeable. But not
              disproportionately so.
                  (with pride)
              I like to think of them as
              aesthetically pleasing --

    Abby steps away, not wanting to ponder Larry's balls anymore
    than she has to.

                        ABBY
              I think I've made my point.

    Larry nods, appeased, as she reaches the door marked ABBY
    RICHTER, PRODUCER, "ALBUQUERQUE A.M." She enters and...

    ...walks in on a shouting match between JOSH, a leftist angry
    news writer, and DORI, the entertainment-leaning co-writer.

                        DORI
              Josh, nobody in Sacramento gives a                              *
              crap about trees in Alaska! It's
              not newsworthy.

              Oh, but full coverage on David
              Beckham's new tattoo is vital?!

    Larry's wife and co-anchor, GEORGIA, 40 and coiffed to the
    gills, storms in, followed by the show's GUEST CHEF.

                        GEORGIA
              He's trying to kill me! He knows I
              can't eat crab, I'm allergic to it!
                  (to the room)
              Does anyone see this? Is this a
              hive?

                        JOSH
              It looks like syphilis to me.

                 chicken. You don't need a chef on
                 this show. You need a box of
                 McNuggets.

    Everyone shouts at each other. Abby calmly pulls out a
    whistle, puts it to her mouth and BLOWS.

                 I have to tell you, Bruce. This is
                 the best Chicken Kiev I've ever
                 tasted.

                           GUEST CHEF
                 Actually it's Duck Kiev. Duck makes
                 an excellent alternative for
                 chicken, Georgia.

    JAVIER, the new fat weatherman, takes a huge bite.

    general manager.

                 Have you seen the ratings for
                 yesterday? We got beat by all the
                 network shows, plus a rerun of
                 "Who's the Boss". The one where
                 the vacuum breaks.

                 It's a temporary setback. This week
                 we'll do better.

                 The guy with the cable access show
                 on Channel 83 does better. If we
                 programed Jerry Springer re-runs,
                 we'd do a nine share at a quarter
                 the price.

    Abby looks worried.

                           ABBY
                 Please tell me you're not thinking
                 of killing the show.

                           STUART
                 I'm not, but I can guarantee you
                 that's what the new management's

                 You've already rescheduled on this
                 guy three times. You cancel tonight
                 and he's gone. He's read more than
                 a dozen books, he has a 401K and
                 he's cute.

                  Hi. I'm looking for a guy with
                  sandy brown hair, athletic build,
                  and blue eyes... he's 5'9 which --
                  I know what you're thinking -- it's
                  a little short, but he's read The
                  Great Gatsby twice, so we'll just
                  live with it, okay?

                            JIM (O.S.)
                  Technically, I'm 5'9 and 3/4.

     She turns, mortified, to see JIM, 30's and good-looking.
     Actually, he's better looking in person than in his photo.
     Abby gulps.

     Abby and Jim sit at a table. Abby looks around, tense.

                  You know what? This is not the best
                  angle. We should get the table over
                  there. Then we both get a view,
                  instead of one of us looking at the
                  busboy station.

                            JIM
                  I'm fine here.

                  No, trust me. It'll be better over

                  Can I get you some water for the

                  Bottle of flat, please.

                            ABBY
                  You know, they've done studies that
                  show tap water is no different from
                  bottled water. And they passed a
                  law recently to have all
                  restaurants filter their tap water.
                  So, technically it's not tap water.

                  It's filtered water, which is

                  I do, I just feel like having a
                  scotch right now.

                  Actually, my associate producer
                  did. She likes me to be prepared.
                  Not that I'm ever not prepared.

     another piece of paper, and hands it to him.

               sure this goes as smoothly as

               Thank you.

     He takes a huge sip, relieved. Abby looks at him.

                  Ugly!

     THE THEME SONG for "The Ugly Truth" kicks in over a series of

     posters spelling the word "LOVE" are destroyed by Mike with a
     variety of weapons. The theme sequence ends and CUTS TO --

18   INT. CHANNEL 83 - STAGE - NIGHT                                   18

     "The Ugly Truth", live on air. The look of the show's set is
     low-rent cable TV.

                            MIKE
                  I'm Mike Alexander and we're back
                  with the "The Ugly Truth." Tonight,
                  as always, we're going to talk
                  about what it is men and women
                  really want in relationships. I've
                  been looking through some books...

     He holds up several books in his hands, reading the titles.

                            MIKE (CONT'D)
                  "Smart Women Foolish Choices",
                  "Women Who Love Men Who Hate Them",
                  "Hating Men Who Love Women But Hate
                  Loving Men"...

     He drops the books on the floor, picks up a can of gasoline
     and pours it on the books.

                            MIKE (CONT'D)
                  Billions and billions of dollars
                  wasted on self-help psycho­babble.

     Mike lights a match and tosses it on the books, setting them
     ablaze. Then opens up his jacket and takes out a stick with a
     marshmallow. Begins roasting the marshmallow on the flame.

                            MIKE (CONT'D)
                  Now listen up, ladies, cause I'm
                  only gonna say this once tonight
                  and it's just three little words.
                  No, they're not "I love you." Here
                  goes... MEN. ARE. SIMPLE. We can
                  not be trained. All this "Men Are
                  From Venus" bullshit is a waste of
                  your time and money.

                  You want to be a lonely hag, then
                  keep reading these stupid books.
                  You want a relationship, here's how
                  you get one: it's called a
                  Stairmaster. Get on it and get
                  skinny and get some trashy lingerie
                  because at the end of the day, all
                  we're interested in is looks. No
                  one falls in love with your
                  personality at first sight, they
                  fall in love with your tits and
                  your ass. And they stick around
                  because of what you're willing to
                  do with them. You want to win a man
                  over? You don't need ten steps. You
                  need one. And it's called a blow-
                  job.

     Mike shoves a burnt marshmallow into his mouth.

     Abby, now infuriated, picks up the phone and begins dialing.

     WE INTERCUT between the stage and her apartment, as Mike
     continues his rant.

                            MIKE
                  Men don't fall in love. Men fall in
                  "want." We want things. We're
                  hunters and gatherers. We're the
                  same as we were when we were
                  cavemen and a gillion years of
                  evolution hasn't done squat. Trust
                  me, there was a Pamela Anderson of
                  cave women and all the cave guys
                  were trying to stick their dicks in
                  her.

     Mike walks over to a chalk board with the word "LOVE" on it.
     He crosses it out and writes "LUST."

                            MIKE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                  Now girls, if you want to think
                  lust is the same as love, that's
                  fine, but you're delusional. Let's
                  take some more calls.
                      (picks up the phone)
                  You're on the air.

     Abby is now on the phone.

                            ABBY
                  So you're saying men are incapable
                  of love?

                            MIKE
                  Did I burst your little Harlequin
                  Romance bubble?

                  The only thing you burst is your
                  credibility. Men are absolutely
                  capable of experiencing love.

                  He's successful, but in a job that
                  means something. He loves red wine,
                  classical music, Cary Grant
                  movies...

                  He works out, not because he's

                  conservative. He likes dogs but

               Why are those qualities so

               your complete lack of any one of

               aren't interested in you. At least

                            STUART
                  Morning, everybody.

     He puts a DVD in the player.

                            STUART
                  Now before I play this, I have to
                  warn you...
                      (hits play)
                  ...he's a little rough around the
                  edges.

     ON TV:     Mike's face appears.

                            MIKE (ON T.V.)
                  Face it, you're ugly!

                            ABBY'S VOICE (O.S.)
                  I am not ugly!

     Joy looks at Abby.

                            JOY
                  Is that you?

                               ABBY
                  What?! No!

                            MIKE (ON T.V.)
                  Ugly people never know they're
                  ugly. It's like people who have
                  B.O.--

     Abby grabs the remote and turns off the T.V.

                            ABBY
                  Why are we watching this?!

                            STUART
                  One word. Ratings. Say hello to our
                  new guest commentator. I'm starting
                  him with two segments a week. Three
                  minutes a pop.

                         STUART
               His name is Mike Alexander.

                            ABBY
               And he's a    quintessential
               misogynist    uber-moron who
               represents    everything wrong with
               television    and society at large...

                         DORI
               I get crap every time I suggest we
               do something even remotely fluffy
               and now you're gonna put this
               douchebag on the air?

                         STUART
               He's got a point of view. We don't
               have to like him, we're news
               people. We're objective. Stone
               Phillips interviews terrorists,
               doesn't mean he likes them. It's
               good for ratings.

     Abby holds up a piece of paper.

                         ABBY
               I've got a whole list of ideas on
               how to improve ratings. We don't
               need him.

     Stuart takes the memo, reading it.

                         STUART
               A live debate on immigration
               policy? Never work.

                         ABBY
               What are you talking about?
               Albuquerque is 45% Latino.

     At this moment, MIKE walks in. Abby stares at him, appalled.

                         MIKE
               Yeah, and as you can tell by all
               the screaming rugrats in this town,
               Latino guys like to have a lot of
               sex. Which means they'd rather
               listen to me tell them how to bang
               hot chicks than hear about why they
               can't bring grandma across the
               border.

               Sorry, I was eavesdropping out in

                         STUART
               See, what did I tell you? He's
               great.

                         MIKE
               Thanks, boss.

     Abby spins to face Stuart.

                         ABBY
               You already hired him?!

     A KNOCK. Then the door opens and Mike appears.

                         MIKE
               Hey, no hard feelings, right?

                         ABBY
               You don't even knock?

                         MIKE
               I knocked. I got no response.

                         ABBY
               So, essentially your knock was
               negated by your complete lack of
               adherence to the social etiquette
               of what follows a knock.

                  This is channel two. You do know
                  that the lower numbers are better,
                  right? More people watch. So don't
                  tell me that "you and I" make good

               Alexander to go down in flames. I
               want Mike Alexander to be nothing
               but a pile of ash on the seat next
               to you. I want the janitor to come
               in with his Dustbuster and vacuum
               up the ashes of Mike Alexander, and
               then when he throws the ashes into
               the dumpster outside, I want the
               rats to vomit and then defecate on
               the ashes of Mike Alexander.

     She strides off. Larry looks at Georgia.

                  For years, there have been concerns
                  about lowering television
                  standards. But many believe that

                  access show, "The Ugly Truth," have
                  brought things to a new low. With
                  that, we welcome Mike Alexander.

                  this cool confident cat. Georgia's
                  no dumb bunny. She knew the only
                  way she was getting off the weekend
                  shift was by hooking up with you.
                  But then lo and behold, she became
                  more popular than you and ended up
                  with twice your salary.

               I'm proud of my wife's success.

                         MIKE
               Bullllloney you are. You hate her
               success. You feel emasculated by
               her and that screws with your head
               which inevitably screws with your
               manhood.

               What's your point, Mr. Alexander?

               Good girl, Georgia. Take control.

                         MIKE
               My point? My point is that your
               husband hasn't had sex with you
               in...I'm gonna say. . .three
               months?

                         LARRY
               That's not my fault!

                         MIKE

               give up the money, so he can get an
               erection?

                         MIKE
               I agree. You've economically
               emasculated your husband to such a
               point that he's afraid to desire
               you. Sure, you can dump his ass,
               but honey, have you seen the
               eligible men in Albuquerque? It's
               slim pickings out there for a woman
               in her forties. You're not going to
               do any better than Larry. You just

     Larry grabs Georgia and kisses her hard. After a moment of

                  First of all - don't listen to what

                  you're supposed to do that to 25-

                  It's nothing worse than what he's

                  And camera one. Action Mike.

     Abby slips out of frame just in time. Mike looks to the

                  a few minutes every day to talk

                  Let's start with men. Men are
                  simple. To illustrate my point --
                  on my left we have the best our
                  world has to offer.

     He crosses to -- a CANDLE-LIT TABLE with a fancy dinner
     placed in the center. Several books rest beside it. Beside
     the table, a man plays violin.

                            MIKE (CONT'D)
                  You have a gourmet meal, fine wine,
                  classical music and great
                  literature.

     He picks up a copy of "Ulysses" from the table.

               Ah, I see you ladies have started
               without me.

     He smiles at TWO BLONDE TWINS IN BIKINIS, who wrestle in a
     kiddie pool of Jello.

     We INTERCUT with the control room.

     A car speeds past, honking obnoxiously at Abby. The cat races
     away, then climbs up a LARGE TREE beside one of the condos.
     Abby sighs and follows.

                            ABBY
                  Really? This is how I get to spend
                  my evening?

     Abby looks up the tree to see D'Artagnan perched on a branch
     above. He MEOWS.

                            ABBY
                  It's okay, baby. Just stay there.

     Abby jumps up, grabs a branch and starts to climb.

                            ABBY (CONT'D)
                  Almost there.

     Abby starts climbing higher, testing branches as she goes.
     Finally she reaches the branch he's on.

                            ABBY (CONT'D)
                  You're gonna be okay. Come on.

     Abby grabs a branch overhead and scoots down the limb. She
     reaches out, picks up the cat and cradles him.

                            ABBY (CONT'D)
                  It's okay. I've got you.

     D'Artagnan safely in hand, she looks around and notices she's
     just outside a window. She looks in and sees --

     A handsome man in a steamy bathroom taking a shower. This is
     COLIN ANDERSON.

                            ABBY (CONT'D)
                  Oh, my.

     Abby covers the cat's eyes, then looks away. But a moment
     later, she's looking back in the window, to see --

     Colin step out of the shower. Abby takes a deep breath as he
     crosses to the mirror, giving her a look at his abs.

                            ABBY (CONT'D)
                  Oh, my, my...

     Abby leans closer to see Colin start flossing, wearing only a
     towel.

                            ABBY (CONT'D)
                      (a delighted gasp)
                  He flosses...

     Suddenly we hear a CRACK, and the branch breaks. Colin looks
     out the window and makes eye contact with Abby just as --

                            ABBY (CONT'D)
                  Ahhhh!

     D'Artagnan leaps to another branch as Abby falls. As she
     plummets, her foot gets caught between some branches, leaving
     her now HANGING UPSIDE DOWN.

                            ABBY (CONT'D)
                  Help!

     The front lights SWITCH ON and Colin, still in a towel, races
     out of his condo. As he runs up to the tree --

                            COLIN
                  Just stay calm. You're gonna be
                  fine.

     The branch breaks.

     Abby FALLS to the ground but --

     Colin CATCHES her. But only for a moment.

     She DROPS out of his arms and onto the ground. As she goes,
     his TOWEL GOES WITH HER. Landing on her face.

                           COLIN
               Whoops.

     She pulls the towel away and looks up, trying not to make eye
     contact with the one-eyed trouser snake staring back at her.

     STEVE (30's, Latino), and     GARY(30's, bespectacled). While
     Mike tries to concentrate     on the game, but the guys are more
     interested in reading his     fan mail.

               can change you and make you fall in
               love. Here's a photo of me and my

     Steve looks at the photo.

                         STEVE
               I thought iguanas only liked dry
               places.

     He passes it to Gary.

     Unpacked boxes are stacked everywhere. Classical music plays
     on the stereo. Colin, now in sweats and a t-shirt, examines
     Abby's ankle.

                            ABBY
                      (impressed)
                  You're a doctor?

                            COLIN
                  An orthopedic surgeon.

     She glances around the room and sees a bottle of red wine and
     a half empty wine glass sitting on a table.

                            COLIN
                  I do a lot of leg and hip stuff but
                  I do get the occasional foot. You
                  seem to be fine. No sprain.

                            ABBY
                  Well, I guess I'm pretty lucky
                  D'Artagnan picked your tree to
                  climb. Dave in the next unit over
                  sells lawn furniture. I don't know
                  that I would have been as confident
                  with his diagnosis.

                  I'm here whenever you need me.

     Abby puts on her shoes as Colin opens his wallet and hands
     her a card.

                  the ankle starts giving you
                  problems, just give me a call.

     Colin picks up the cat, who starts purring.

                            ABBY
                  Wow, he doesn't usually like men.

                  Dogs are great, but...well, you're
                  a cat person. You know.

     Abby looks at him, nodding. Delighted at his complete and
     utter perfection.

                  Well, I guess I should get going

     She remains rooted to her spot. He waits a beat then, feeling
     awkward, makes a move to open the door.

     She walks out and Colin closes the door. Realizing that he
     still has the cat in his arms, he opens the door to find --

     Abby doing a SPAZZY HAPPY DANCE. Startled, she quickly
     composes herself.

                            COLIN (CONT'D)

                  Oh. Thanks. There was a -- spider.
                  On me. But it's gone now.

     He chuckles, hands her D'Artagnan.

               Yeah, I picked up on that.

43   INT. KPHX - CORRIDOR - DAY - MOMENTS LATER                        43

     Abby walks down the corridor. She turns the corner and comes
     face to face with Mike.

                         MIKE
               Why do you hate my guts?

               Your innards are of no consequence
               to me. I hate what you represent.

               For your information, I happened to
               meet him last night.

               I really hope he's real this time,
               because otherwise this is just sad.

                         ABBY
               Oh, he's very real. Not to mention
               stunningly handsome and morally

                  neighbor. From last night.

     Colin, in a white doctor's jacket, talks on the phone while
     going over patient files.

                            COLIN
                  Oh, hi. Everything okay?

     We INTERCUT.

                            ABBY
                  Couldn't be better. I just wanted
                  to call and tell you how much I
                  enjoyed meeting you.

     Mike picks up the extension and listens in. Abby glares at
     him, but she can't stop him.

                            COLIN
                  Oh, thanks.

                            ABBY
                  So... I was just thinking that we
                  should have dinner.

                            COLIN
                      (not great)
                  Oh... great.

                            ABBY
                  There's this new French Bistro that
                  got fantastic reviews and there's a
                  gallery opening in Old Town on
                  Friday. So, if you want, we could
                  have dinner, then go to the
                  opening.

                            COLIN
                  Hmmm, Friday... wow.

                  Don't! He'll be expecting you to
                  call him back. When you don't,
                  he'll call you.

                            MIKE
                  Because I know men. If you want it
                  to work out with this guy, you'll
                  listen to me and do exactly as I
                  say. You already did irreparable
                  damage with your psycho-aggressive
                  control freak phone call. It might
                  even be too late. Even if you do
                  salvage the situation, you'll
                  probably never be more than Abby,
                  his desperate neighbor.

                             ABBY
                  I'm not desperate!
                      (then)
                  Why, did I sound desperate?

                  Listen to you -- desperately asking
                  me if you sound desperate.

               than you do.

     They stare each other down. Then Mike looks at his watch.

                         MIKE (CONT'D)
               Thirty seconds.

     The phone light is still blinking.

                         ABBY
               My God, you're right. Now what?

     Mike hangs up the phone.

                         MIKE
               Always make an impression. Let's
               get out of here. We have work to
               do.

                         ABBY
               But what about --

                          MIKE
               Don't worry, in five seconds he'll
               call back.

     The phone RINGS again.

     He hustles her out of the room. A moment after the door
     closes, Mike rushes back in and hangs up the ringing phone.
     He smiles, then bolts.

     Abby and Mike walk down the street.

                         MIKE
               Rule number one. Never criticize.

                         ABBY
               Even if it's constructive?

                         MIKE
               Never. Men are incapable of growth,
               change or progress. For men, self-
               improvement ends at toilet-
               training. Rule number two. Laugh at
               whatever he says.

                         ABBY
               What if what he's saying isn't
               funny?

                         MIKE
               That's irrelevant. A fake laugh is
               like a fake orgasm.

                         ABBY
               And a fake orgasm is good?

                         MIKE
               No, but a fake orgasm is better
               than no orgasm at all.

                         ABBY
               A fake orgasm is no orgasm.

                  person in the room, you know. Let's
                  not be selfish.

     Abby giggles. Mike is struck by the sound of her laughter.

                            MIKE (CONT"D)
                  That was perfect. You have a
                  perfect laugh. Real or fake?

     Mike and Abby wait for their lattes.

                            MIKE
                  Rule number three. Never talk about
                  your problems. Men don't really
                  listen or care.

                            ABBY
                  Some men care.

                            MIKE
                  No. Some men pretend to care. When
                  we ask you how you're doing, it's
                  just guy code for "let me put my
                  dick in your ass."

                            ABBY
                  Okay, I'm trying to decide whether
                  I should just walk away right now,
                  or run.

                            MIKE
                  I know you think Colin is above it
                  all, but he's a guy. If he's even
                  remotely into you, he's thought
                  about each one of your orifices at
                  least ten times.

                            ABBY
                  I love how you assume every man is
                  as perverse as you are.

                            MIKE
                  I don't assume. I know.
                                                                 52.

     Mike and Abby walk along, coffees in hand.

                          MIKE
               Rule number four. Men are very
               visual. Ninety percent of a
               relationship is based on how good
               the woman looks. We have to change
               your look.

                         ABBY
               What's wrong with my look?

                         MIKE
                   (taking her in)
               Sports bras? Khakis? Srunchies?
               Nurse shoes?

                          ABBY
               These aren't nurse shoes! They're
               Lady Keds.

                         MIKE
               Abby, you're a very attractive
               woman but you are completely
               inaccessible. You're all about
               comfort and efficiency.

                         ABBY
               What's wrong with comfort and
               efficiency?

                         MIKE
               Nothing. Except no one wants to
               fuck it.

     With that, a MONTAGE BEGINS...

     Mike and Abby wander through the racks of lingerie.

                         ABBY
               I am not getting breast implants.

                         MIKE
               Size isn't everything. Breasts just
               have to be friendly. They have to
               say, "Hello, everybody! Look at
               me!"

     Abby looks down at her breasts, curiously.

                            MIKE (CONT'D)
                  Excuse me ma'am, but we need some
                  bras that will make my friend's
                  boobs say, "Put me in your mouth --
                  I taste good."

     The saleswoman looks disturbed, but hands him a push-up water
     bra.

                  I just don't want to be perceived
                  as a bimbo.

                            MIKE
                  I don't want you to be a bimbo. You
                  need to be two people, the saint
                  and the sinner, the librarian and
                  the stripper. It's a delicate
                  balance. On one hand, you have to
                  push the guy away with cold
                  indifference and yet on the other
                  hand be a sexually teasing tornado.

     Abby enters, looking amazing in a little black dress and

                  But I wear contacts. Besides,

                  Yeah, but we're going for a

               for me to grab it? You're just a
               set of orifices and a pair of tee-
               tas."

                         MIKE
               You're a deeply, deeply disturbed
               person.

     Switching tactics, Abby slips into seductress mode, tracing
     her finger up and down his arm.

                         ABBY
               Maybe I'm just a good student.

                         MIKE
               Would you stop doing that?

                         ABBY
               Doing what?

                         MIKE
               Touching me with your finger.

     She seductively leans into him.

                         ABBY
               Why? Am I turning you on?

                            MIKE
               Maybe.

     She gives him a look.

                         ABBY
               Actually, I kind of like it.

                            MIKE
               Really...

     She leans in closer.

                            ABBY
               Sucker.

     He shoves her away.

               I'm not ready for this. Am I? I'm
               not.

               Calm down. Keep the conversation
               under a minute. Be mysterious. Keep
               him guessing.

     Mike leaps over the couch and hides. As Abby walks over to
     the door and opens it. Colin stands there.

                            ABBY
               Oh. Hey.

                         COLIN
               Hi. Wow, you look great.

                            ABBY
               Thanks.

                         COLIN

               You put me on hold and didn't call

     Mike pops up from under the couch. He gives her the thumbs
     up.

               Saturday?

     She looks at Mike in amazement, then breaks into the happy
     dance. He watches, horrified at her spazziness.

                         MIKE
               What the hell is that?!

                  There's no right answer to that
                  question. Do something non-
                  committal...

     Abby does something between a nod and shaking her head. Colin
     hooks at her, confused.

                  I'm really more of a fair weather
                  fan myself. I do like watching Mike

                  Laugh.

     Abby is baffled but proceeds to laugh awkwardly. Colin looks

     finds Abby and Colin. PANS over to them and --

     It looks like Abby is giving Colin an enthusiastic HAND JOB.

     The ENTIRE STADIUM, ballplayers included, stop what they're
     doing and stare.

                         ABBY (CONT'D)
               Are you sure they're cotton cause
               this should be coming out, wait...
               it's coming. It's definitely
               coming. It's...done!

     She smiles at Colin. As he looks nervously up at the
     JUMBOTRON.

     Abby follows his gaze -- and sees SHE'S ON IT. Everyone at
     the stadium is looking at her. The organ player bangs out
     "Charge." The stadium starts WHOOPING and HOLLERING.

57   EXT. BALLPARK - DAY                                             57

     Abby is getting a citation from a self-righteous POLICE
     OFFICER.

                         POLICE OFFICER
               This is a family place, ma'am.       Not
               an open-air hand job palace.

                         ABBY
               I understand, officer.

                         POLICE OFFICER
               You want to pull those kind of
               stunts, you do it at home. Or in
               the backseat of a car, like moral
               upstanding people do.

     He hands her a ticket and walks off.

58   EXT. ABBY'S CONDO - NIGHT                                         58

     Colin walks a defeated Abby to her door.

     NEARBY, Mike watches this, unseen and impassive.

                         COLIN
               Well, I can't say it was boring.

                         ABBY
               That was pretty much the all-time
               worst first date ever.

                         COLIN
               Gee, thanks.

     Mike looks worried.

                         MIKE
                   (to Abby)
               Where are you going with this?       No
               guy wants to hear that!

                          ABBY
               No, no, I take full responsibility.
               So...
                   (sticking out her hand)
               ...Thanks.
                   (as he shakes her hand)
               But, hey, at least your pants are
               clean.

     He smiles, amused.

                         COLIN
               You're not what I'm used to.

                         ABBY
                   (sighing)
               I know...

                         COLIN
               Actually, that's a good thing. I'm
               used to women I can figure out in
               five seconds. I can't do that with
               you.

     Mike rolls his eyes.

                         MIKE
               He's an idiot. I figured you out in
               two.

                  Good night.

                            MIKE
                  ...And walk away.

     She starts to walk away when Colin stops her, grabbing her
     arm and pulling her in for a kiss.

                            COLIN
                  That definitely made up for my wet
                  crotch.

                            ABBY
                      (dreamily)
                  Me, too.
                      (off his look; realizing)
                  Just -- scratch that.

     Colin gives a wave and walks toward his condo. Abby pretends
     to enter her house until she sees Colin close his front door.
     Then, she turns around and rushes over to --

     MIKE. She throws her arms around him, embracing him.

                            ABBY
                  You did it! You did it!

     Mike pulls back, a little uncomfortable.

                             MIKE
                  I didn't do anything. It was you.
                  Don't ask me why, but I think he
                  likes you.

                            ABBY
                  He's really a great guy, isn't he?

     Abby puts her key in the door.

                         ABBY
               I'm going to ignore that because
               I'm in a very good mood.

               Yeah, I heard, wet crotch.

     Abby rolls her eyes with a smile and goes inside. As Mike is
     walking away, he turns back for a moment, then keeps walking.

59   INT. ELIZABETH'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM -       NIGHT                59

     Jonah and Mike sit on the couch, playing "Fight Night."

                         JONAH
               So, no date tonight?

                         MIKE
               As a matter of fact, I did have a
               date. It wasn't mine, but it was a
               date. I was helping out a friend.

                         JONAH
               Guy or girl?

                           MIKE

                         JONAH

     A cage of randy Bonobos getting it on. Mike, in a gorilla
     suit, does a segment. Next to him is an anthropologist, DR.
     LESTER.

                            DR. LESTER
                  Of all primates, Bonobos are the
                  closest relatives to human beings,
                  both genetically and socially ­-
                  especially when it comes to sex.
                  For the Bonobo, sex is a way to
                  ease stress and diffuse tensions.

                            MIKE
                  So summing up Bonobo-land, the
                  chicks look great, get freaky in
                  bed and in turn, they get to sit on
                  their asses and boss their men
                  around all day.

                            DR. LESTER
                  That's one way of looking at it.

                            MIKE
                  If that's not an argument for
                  evolution, I don't know what is.

               No, I call it masturbating, but I
               thought it would offend your
               delicate lady-like sensibilities.
                   (beat)
               So... how often do you flick it?

                         ABBY
               I just don't think of myself that
               way.

                         MIKE
               Well, you need to start. Because if
               you don't want to have sex with
               you, why the hell should Colin?

61   EXT. ABBY'S CONDO - NIGHT                                     61

     Abby opens the door to find a gift bag on her doorstep, with
     a card that reads: "This present isn't for you. It's for your
     bean. Love Mike."
                                                                 71.

62   INT. ABBY'S CONDO - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                           62

     Abby sits on the couch staring at a box of ELECTRIC
     UNDERWEAR.

     She opens the box, dumping out a pair of underwear and a
     REMOTE CONTROL. When she turns on the remote the underwear
     VIBRATES, startling her. She turns it off.

63   INT. ABBY'S CONDO - BEDROOM - NIGHT                               63

     Abby checks herself out in the mirror. Now in the underwear.
     She downs a glass of wine, sits on the bed and picks up the
     remote. She turns it on. Nothing happens. She tries again.
     Nothing.

                            ABBY
               Great.

     Abby smacks the remote a few times. The DOORBELL rings.

     Abby heads toward the door, but quickly realizes she's still
     holding the remote. She tosses it in her purse, then opens
     the door.

     Mike stands there out of breath, dressed in a suit.

                         MIKE
               You have to come with me.

                            ABBY

                  I'm Mike. Change in plans. Grab

     twin JELLO GIRLS, BAMBI and CANDI, rush up to Mike.

                  Hey, ladies. You're looking quite
                  fetching.

     The group sits down at the table.

                  So, you guys here to give me a
                  raise, or what?

     UNDER THE TABLE

     Abby tries to kick Mike. As she does, she unwittingly knocks
     over her purse. The contents spill out and the REMOTE for
     her vibrating underwear rolls away, stopping UNDER THE TABLE
     NEXT TO THEM.

     AT THE NEXT TABLE

     A PRECOCIOUS KID, 8, sits with his parents. Bored out of his
     skull. When the remote rolls under his feet, the kid picks
     it up and flicks the switch. A small RED LIGHT turns on.

     AT ABBY'S TABLE

     As Harold and Bob laugh, Stuart slaps Mike on the back.

                            STUART
                  That's my guy. Always with the
                  jokes.

     of her purse have spilled. Mike's head appears next to hers.

                  You're wearing them? Now?

     She writhes again, hitting her head on the bottom of the
     table.

     Stuart watches, worried, as Abby rises from underneath the
     table, clutching her head and looking around frantically,
     trying to figure out who has the remote.

     AT THE NEXT TABLE

     The kid has flicked up the speed on the remote even higher.

     Abby's eyes roll back. She looks like she's on three hits of
     ecstasy.

               teasers.

               Well, it's fifteen seconds...each
               hour.

     in hand. He starts to get up but --

               They're very -- oh!

     As Stuart frowns, concerned, Abby spasms, then rushes through
     it as fast as she can.

               It's fifteen seconds every hour of
               Mike telling an Ugly Truth
               and...Jesus...GOD, they're good.

     She leaps to her feet.

                           ABBY (cont'd)
               Ohhhhh...

     Then she sinks back down, spent. Harold and Bob applaud, as
     do the twins. Relieved, Stuart turns to Bob and Harold.

                         STUART
               See what I mean about her?

                         COLIN
                   (proudly)
               You've got to love her enthusiasm.

69   INT. SAFFRON - BAR AREA - NIGHT - LATER                       69

     As they all walk out, Mike grabs the remote from the kid.

                         MIKE
               Sorry, buddy, that's my toy.

     Abby spots this and snatches the remote out of Mike's hand.

                         ABBY
               You knew he had it the whole time,
               didn't you?

                         MIKE
               No, just part of the time. Figured
               I should let you finish.

     She shoots him a look.

                         MIKE (cont'd)
               Seriously, thanks for coming
               tonight. I mean, you know, to
               dinner.

                         ABBY
               You would have done fine without
               me.

                           MIKE
               I know.
                                                                78.

     Stuart schmoozes with Harold, Bob, Bambi and Candi at the
     valet stand. Abby and Mike exit the restaurant.

                         MIKE
               He likes you, by the way. Colin. I
               can tell.

                           ABBY
               Really?

     Colin walks up.

                         COLIN
               Are we ready to go?     I know Abby
               is.

     Harold and Bob shake hands with Mike.

                         HAROLD
               Keep up the good work, Mike.

                         BOB
               And thanks for introducing us to
               our future ex-wives.

                         MIKE
               You kids play safe.

     They take off with the twins.     Mike turns to Abby and Colin.

                         MIKE
               So, what's next? A little three-way
               Scrabble? Some Twister? Maybe a
               massage chain? We could write in
               each others' diaries...

                         COLIN
               I think we've got it from here.

     Mike's truck pulls up and he gets in.

                         MIKE
               Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

     He drives away. Abby smiles at Colin, as a punk rock version
     of "Getting To Know You" PLAYS and a MONTAGE BEGINS...

71   EXT. SANDIA MOUNTAIN - DAY                                        71

     Abby and Colin are watching "TO CATCH A THIEF." Colin puts
     his arm around Abby.

                         COLIN
               I can't believe I've never seen
               this before.

     Abby grins, pleased.

     Mike's on set rehearsing with a HOT GIRL next to him. NEARBY,
     Abby gets flowers delivered. Mike tries not to be distracted
     by Abby's delighted expression as she reads the card.

74   INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY                                            74

     At the counter, Abby introduces Colin to Joy. As Colin turns
     away to get his latte, Joy falls to the ground in a MOCK
     SWOON. Colin sees this and, concerned, rushes to help Joy up.

75   INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT                                           75

     Mike stands at the sports bar with Dwayne, Steve and Gary, as
     a DRUNK GUY praises Mike.

                         DRUNK GUY
                   (to Mike)
               Dude, you got me laid three times
               last month. Drinks are on me.

                         MIKE
               Just doing my job.

     Just then a CUTE BRUNETTE in a tight t-shirt and ridiculously
     gynormous implants walks up.

                         CUTE BRUNETTE
               I got implants, just like you said!

                         MIKE
                   (horrified)
               Indeed you did.

                         DWAYNE
               Here's to implants!

     Steve clinks his beer bottle against Mike's.

                         STEVE
               You're a rock star, bro.

76   INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT                                           76

     A waiter takes Colin and Abby's order.

                            WAITER
                  A bottle of water to start?

                            COLIN
                  Yes, a bottle of flat, please.

     She starts to say something, then smiles at the waiter.

                            ABBY
                  I'll have one, too.

     Colin smiles at her as THE MONTAGE ENDS.

     Mike has a beer and enjoys the scenery as Abby sits across
     from him at their table, making notes.

                            ABBY
                  The Balloon Fiesta is coming up,
                  so, I was thinking for sweeps, we
                  could do a segment on "how men are
                  full of hot air."

     He doesn't answer.

                            ABBY (cont'd)
                  I was kidding --

     Mike isn't even listening. He's watching a trashy redhead at
     the bar. Abby notices.

                            ABBY (cont'd)
                  Colin would never like a girl like
                  that.

                            MIKE
                  I forgot, Colin only likes "women
                  of quality."

                  Exactly my point. Man-whores want
                  women who wear slutty clothes and
                  suck lots of cock.

                             MIKE
                  Every man wants that. And for your
                  information, I was only with the
                  one who can read.
                      (then)
                  Did you just say cock?

                  What? I can say cock. You don't own
                  that word. Cock. There. I said it
                  again.

                             MIKE
                  A week ago you cried at the thought
                  of a vibrator. Now you're all "cock
                  this,""cock that."
                      (then)
                  You had sex with Colin, didn't you?

               So there you have it. Never assume
               a girl is easy, or assume she's a
               prude. There are many layers in
               between and it's your job,
               gentlemen, to peel back those
               layers and figure out exactly what
               type of woman you are dealing with.

     NEARBY, a confused Joy looks at Abby.

               What happened to him? That sounded
               almost enlightened.

     Abby doesn't know weather to be pleased or worried.

                         MIKE
               Because once you do peel back those
               layers, my friends, her lady garden
               awaits. And I'm pretty sure you're
               gonna want to fertilize that patch
               of petunias. And that there is the
               Ugly Truth.

     Abby runs a programming meeting. Joy, Dori, Josh, Georgia and
     Larry are in attendance.

                         ABBY
               What's our story at the top of the

                         JOSH
               Oh, I'm sorry, did Anna Nicole come
               back from the dead?

     Stuart pokes his head in.

                         STUART
               Abby? I need you.

     She rises and goes out into the hall.

81   INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                         81

     Abby frowns at Stuart's serious expression.

                            ABBY
               What's up?

                         STUART
               I just found out Mike was offered a
               job by the local NBC affiliate at
               twice the pay. This Leno thing is
               his audition.

                  this, we're dead. I need you to fly
                  out there and talk him out of it.

                  Just don't let him know you know
                  beforehand. Let him do the show and
                  get us our publicity, then convince

                  three years. Now go.

82   EXT. AIRPORT - DAY                                                82

     An airplane lands at LAX.

     A pissed Abby sits in the cab, having a conversation with
     herself.

                            ABBY
                  Hi, stupid motherfucker who'd still
                  be on cable access if it weren't
                  for me. I hear you're moving to
                  NBC.

     The CAB DRIVER looks at her.

                            CAB DRIVER
                  What did you just call me?

                  Nothing. Just practicing my speech.

84   EXT. HOTEL - DAY                                                  84

     Mike walks out of the lobby, as Abby gets out of a cab,
     suitcase in hand.

                              MIKE
                  Abby?    What are you doing here?

     Abby glares at him, about to show her true feelings, but then
     quickly covers. Smiling.

                  a producer more than I needed to
                  get laid.

85   INT. TOWN CAR - DAY                                               85

     Abby and Mike sit in the backseat.      Abby looks down at her
     notes.

                  Okay, so let's go over the pre-
                  interview questions.

     Mike studies her.

                            MIKE
                  I'm sorry you didn't get to meet
                  little Colin this weekend. And by
                  little, I don't mean undersized,
                  although I highly suspect that's
                  the case.

                            ABBY
                  Really? Colin's penis? That's what
                  you want to talk about right now? I
                  was thinking maybe we should talk
                  about what you're gonna say on the
                  show.
                      (doing Jay)
                  So, tell me Mike. How did "The Ugly
                  Truth" start?

                            MIKE
                  Well, Jay, I had a sales job where
                  I drove around a lot, listening to
                  talk radio. I started calling in
                  and lo and behold, people liked
                  what I had to say. Then I decided
                  what the hell, I need my own show.
                  I have a message people need to
                  hear.

     Abby rolls her eyes, still angry with him.

                  Excuse me, lady, but you have a
                  boyfriend right now because of me.

                            ABBY
                  It may have started because of you,
                  but it's lasted because of me.

                  When you checked into the hotel,
                  did you or did you not insist on
                  getting an "Eastern-facing" room on

                  My point is, Colin likes the Mike
                  version of Abby, not the Abby
                  version of Abby. So, don't go
                  knocking my words of wisdom when
                  you're living proof that they work.

     She smiles at him. Looking a little calmer, he smiles back
     at Abby. The Agent rolls his eyes. The handler gives Mike

                  Don't do it. Try to find lust
                  instead. It's a lot easier and a
                  lot less messy. Blue balls only
                  last a few hours. A broken heart

                  doozy.

                  me who have been happily married
                  for twenty-seven years? We can't be

                  Well, Jay, let me tell ya --

     He hesitates, then looks at Abby for a moment. She gives him
     an encouraging nod. He gains confidence, and continues.

                  Marriage starts off great. She's
                  cute, you're cute, the world's

                   (to Mike)
               You were amazing out there.

                  You go ahead and hold our table,
                  doll. We've got some business to
                  discuss.

     They walk off.    Abby fumes -- then does her self hating
     spazzy dance.

90   INT. EL FLORIDITA RESTAURANT - NIGHT                              90

     A festive Cuban place in Hollywood with a live salsa band and
     a floor full of SEXY PATRONS salsa dancing.

     Abby sits at a table, waiting anxiously. As Mike walks in,
     she waves him over.

                            ABBY
                      (confused)
                  Where's Rick?

                            MIKE
                  I sent him home. I thought we
                  should celebrate on our own.

     Abby's surprised, then suspicious.

                            ABBY
                  What exactly are we celebrating?

                            MIKE
                  Uh, hello? Leno? I was just on it.
                  Maybe you saw?

     The waiter arrives with mojitos. Abby looks at him.

                            ABBY
                  I know about the offer from NBC.

     He looks at her, surprised, then --

                            MIKE
                  Okay, well then you know I turned
                  it down. If it weren't for you, I'd
                  still be on Channel 83. So don't
                  worry, I'm not going anywhere.

                  Relax. Drink. Enjoy. You did your
                  job. I'm re-signing with you. Now
                  let's stop talking about work.

     Abby sips her mojito, studying Mike.

                            ABBY
                  So...who was the doozy?

                            MIKE
                  What are you, trying to kill my
                  buzz?

                             ABBY
                  No, I'm interested. In what makes
                  you...you.

     Mike sighs, deciding to level with her.

                            MIKE
                  It wasn't just one...it was more
                  like a parade. By the time I hit
                  thirty, I realized you can only
                  have so many bad relationships
                  before you figure out there's no
                  such thing as a good one.

                            ABBY
                  You can't really believe there's no
                  such thing as a good relationship.

                            MIKE
                  To my very core.

     Just then, the waitress walks up.

                            WAITRESS
                  Two more mojitos?

                            ABBY
                  And some water, please.

                            WAITRESS
                  Still or sparkling?

                            MIKE
                  Just bring us tap water.

     She nods and leaves. Abby stares at him.

               So I've been told.

     He stands up.

                         MIKE
               C'mon, let's dance.

                         ABBY
               I don't think so.

                         MIKE
               I'm serious. I've seen your spazzy
               dance, now I want to see the real
               thing.

     Abby looks out at the dance floor, seeing that even the worst
     dancers are great.

                         ABBY
               I can't dance like that.

                           MIKE
               I can.

     Mike grabs her hand and leads her onto --

     Mike and Abby make their way onto the crowded dance floor.

                         MIKE
               You'll be fine.

     Abby looks at him, sure that he's about to make a fool of
     them both.

     Then, he takes her in his arms, completely self-assured, and
     starts leading her in a salsa dance and...

     ...he's good. But not just good. Great.

     She follows his moves, half-shocked and half-turned on. He
     pulls her in a bit closer, and for the first time, she allows
     herself to be led without trying to control the situation.

     For about five seconds.          Then she looks at her watch.

                  So the car's picking us up

                  I'll get a wake up call.

                  Good idea.

     There's a moment of uncomfortable silence.

                            ABBY (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                  I had a great time.

     Mike starts out the elevator, then returns, grabbing Abby.
     And suddenly --

     They're ALL OVER EACH OTHER.

     In the midst of this, the elevators try to close but their
     furious groping blocks it, until --

     A shrill BUZZING begins. They abruptly step apart staring at
     each other.

                  How convenient.

                            ABBY
                  I thought it was you at the door.

     He stops and looks at her.

                            MIKE
                  I guess we're all interchangeable.
                  I've taught you well. Maybe you
                  should take over the show.

     He starts to walk off.

                            ABBY
                  Mike, wait -- tell me what just
                  happened in the elevator.

     They hold eye contact for a very long moment.

                            ABBY (cont'd)
                  Should I tell Colin to go?

     Mike looks away.

                            MIKE
                  Why pull up anchor now? You've
                  worked damn hard to get him here.

                            ABBY
                  Really? That's it? That's all you
                  have to say.

                            MIKE
                  What else do you want me to say?

     A lot.    But he's not saying it.

                            ABBY
                  I guess the truth is ugly, isn't
                  it?

                            MIKE
                  That's what I've been telling you.

     He shrugs and walks off.

                  Sorry, about that. He was upset
                  about his performance on Leno.

                            COLIN
                  No worries. The rest of the night
                  is ours.

     He pours her a glass of wine.

                            COLIN (cont'd)
                  To the first of many romantic
                  evenings to come.

     Abby takes the glass and drinks.      And keeps drinking.

                            COLIN (cont'd)
                  Whoa --

     Abby finishes the glass and looks at him.

                  You're open, you laugh at my jokes,

     Abby's smile fades.

                            COLIN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                  You never try to control the
                  situation, and I've got to say,
                  it's a breath of fresh air. A lot
                  of women I know are total control
                  freaks -- and it's a nightmare. I
                  love that you're not like that.

     Abby looks at him, nodding, then --

                To be honest, I didn't like the way
                you poured the wine. I would have
                decanted it. And I was editing that
                speech as you were giving it.

      Jack Magnum does his intro, now standing in a balloon basket.

                             JACK MAGNUM (ON T.V.)
                   ...and this is The Ugly Truth!

      Jack starts to do "the gun", but then he remembers and
      awkwardly turns it into a peace sign.

                              JACK MAGNUM (ON T.V.) (CONT'D)

      Jonah watches TV as Mike gets a beer out of the fridge.

                             JONAH
                   Dude, check this out. Your
                   replacement's on.

                              MIKE
                   My what?

      Mike looks over to see --

      ON THE TV -- Live footage from the Balloon Fiesta. Jack
      Magnum continues to alienate his audience.

                             JACK MAGNUM
                   Most of you are watching this show
                   so you can learn how to get chicks.
                   Let me assure you, you're in good
                   hands. You're looking at a guy
                   who's personally had sex with over
                   137 women. Most of them conscious.

                             ABBY
                   He's ad-libbing. Why is he ad-
                   libbing? There's no ad-libbing.

107   INT. MIKE'S APARTMENT - DAY - CONTINUOUS                            107

      Mike sits down on the couch to watch.

                             MIKE
                   Oh, this is beautiful.

      ON TV -- Jack Magnum just makes it worse.

                             JACK MAGNUM (ON T.V.)
                   We're here at the Balloon Fiesta,
                   and I'm supposed to be telling you
                   men are full of hot air, but I
                   think we all know, it's the ladies
                   that are full of crap. Just because
                   she says no, doesn't mean she means
                   no.

      At this Jack Magnum is tackled and pushed out of the balloon
      basket. After a moment --

      A frazzled ABBY pops up in his place.

                             ABBY (ON T.V.)
                       (nervous)
                   Hi! I'm sorry, but Jack Magnum will
                   no longer be able to do "The Ugly
                   Truth" segment. Which should really
                   come as no surprise. Because men
                   are completely unreliable.

108   INT. KPHX - DAY - CONTINUOUS                                     108

      Stuart and Cliff watch from the control room, in shock.

                             CLIFF
                   What is she doing?

      The PHONE RINGS. Stuart picks up, then blanches.

                              STUART
                       (into phone)
                   Hey, Harold. Yes, I know -- we're
                   fixing it.

      Abby stands in the basket, still nervous, but flying on
      adrenaline. Joy gives her a "keep going" hand gesture.

                             ABBY
                   Take Mike Alexander, for instance.
                   He up and quit the show without so
                   much as a word. You think you know
                   what men are going to do, you think
                   you know what they want to do...but
                   when it comes down to the moment
                   where they actually have to nut up,
                   they turn around and do something
                   completely different.

                          MIKE
                Oh, I'm all over this.

      He races out, as Jonah calls after him.

                          JONAH
                I don't think she's into you,guy!

      Joy and the camera guy watch as Abby gains steam, ranting to
      the camera. B-CAMERA, strapped to the basket, also records.

                          ABBY
                The big, strong, romantic men we've
                been reading about in novels and
                watching in movies since we were
                nine? They're fallacies. "Blue
                Lagoon" is a total freakin' lie.
                Men are not strong. Men are not
                brave. Men are afraid.

112   INT. KPHX - "SACRAMENTO AM" SET - DAY                            112 *

      From the news desk, Georgia and Larry watch the monitor,
      confused.

                    (offended)
                I love "Blue Lagoon".

      Georgia squeezes his hand.

                ...They're afraid to say what they
                feel. Afraid to grow up. Afraid to
                tell the truth.

      Abby continues her impassioned tirade.

                          ABBY
                Even if they have a moment in a
                hotel elevator that's totally
                romantic and filled with potential,
                men are completely incapable of
                copping to it. Because men are
                weak.

                          MIKE (O.S.)
                Let me tell you something about
                women.

      She turns to see --

      MIKE standing there. He pushes past Joy and climbs into the
      balloon. Grabbing the mic from Abby's hand.

                            ABBY
                Hey --

                          MIKE
                    (ignoring her; to camera)
                Women would have us believe that
                they are the victims. They aren't.
                They want us to think that we break
                their hearts for sport. That's
                crap. They say they want romance.
                They say they want true love, but
                all they want is a checklist. Is he
                perfect? Is he handsome? Is he a
                doctor?

                I thought he quit.

                   That is not true.

      BY THE CAMERAMAN, Joy shrugs.

                             JOY
                   Well, kinda true.

      Mike continues his rant.

                             MIKE
                   You men that fit the criteria --
                   don't kid yourselves. They're not
                   sleeping with you. They're sleeping
                   with a carefully calculated set of
                   venal choices. Money over
                   substance. Looks over soul. Polish
                   over principles. No gesture, no
                   matter how real or romantic, will
                   ever compensate for a really
                   impressive list of credentials.

                             ABBY
                   Says the man who's never made a
                   gesture except for this one --

      She makes the universally known "jack-off" hand gesture.

                             MIKE
                   So, the elevator wasn't a gesture?

                             ABBY
                   The elevator was a moment of
                   passion, followed by a moment of
                   panic on your part, apparently.

                I came by your room!

                          ABBY
                And then you ran away.

                          MIKE
                Well, that wasn't panic,
                sweetheart. It was an unwillingness
                to compete with the walking
                checklist that was in your bed. You
                should be thanking me.

      NEARBY, Joy taps her watch.

                          JOY
                We have ten seconds.

      An OVERZEALOUS BALLOON PILOT walks up.

                          PILOT
                Are we ready to soar up, up and
                away?

      IN THE BASKET, Mike looks at the camera.

                          MIKE
                And that's the Ugly Truth, folks. A
                girl in heat for two guys will
                always pick the one with the better
                resume.

      BEHIND HIM, the Pilot silently boards the balloon.

                          ABBY
                That is bullsh --

      The TORCH of the BALLOON is suddenly fired, covering her FBC
      violation.

      The cameraman follows the balloon as it slowly starts to
      rise.

                          JOY
                ...And we're out.

                    (freaked)
                I hate you so much I just swore on
                live television.

                          MIKE
                No, you hate yourself for being so
                shallow.

                             PILOT
                Off we go!

      Abby and Mike spin around to look at him.       Realizing the
      balloon is now soaring upwards.

                          ABBY
                Where are we going?!

                          MIKE
                I'm not going anywhere with you.

      Mike starts to climb out.

                          ABBY
                What a shock. You're bailing.

                          PILOT
                I wouldn't recommend that...

      Mike looks down to see --

      They are now FIFTEEN FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. And rising.         He
      stops climbing, as the balloon continues to float up and
      away.

                          PILOT (cont'd)

                          STUART
                They don't know the camera is on,
                do they?

124   EXT. SKY - DAY - A MOMENT LATER                                  124

      Now holding champagne glasses, a disgusted Mike and Abby look
      at opposite ends of the sky, hating that they are trapped
      together.

                          MIKE
                Hey! I know -- we can pass the time
                with you telling me how much fun
                you and Colin had having sex in Los
                Angeles.

                          ABBY
                I broke up with Colin in Los
                Angeles, jackass.

      Mike is thrown, turning to look at her.

                            MIKE
                What?

                          PILOT
                To our left, we have the Sandia
                Mountains, glistening in the
                afternoon twilight...

      Abby ignores the pilot.

                          ABBY
                Oh, that got your interest? If you
                think we're going to finish what we
                started in LA, you're out of your
                mind. You lost your chance.

                          PILOT
                And to our right, you'll see the
                Rio Grande River winding its way
                through the diochramatic
                landscape...

      Mike ignores the pilot as well.

                          MIKE
                I never had a chance with you.

                          PILOT
                And off in the distance, we have
                the Petroglyph National Monument,
                where --

                          ABBY
                    (to the Pilot)
                Can you stop talking, please?

                       (to Mike)
                   You're right. I had a momentary
                   lapse in judgement where I thought
                   you might be more than you are. But
                   you aren't. Clearly.

                             MIKE
                   What does that mean?

                             ABBY

                             JOY
                   Don't worry, I saw this coming, so
                   I got us a three second delay.

      Mike glares at Abby.

                             MIKE
                   Yeah, it is "scary." It's fucking
                   terrifying. Especially because I'm
                   in love with a psycho like you.

      Abby stares at Mike.

                          ABBY
                I am not a psycho.

                          MIKE
                I just told you I loved you and all
                you heard was "psycho". You are the
                definition of neurotic.

                           ABBY
                The definition of neurotic is a
                person who suffers from anxiety,
                obsessional thoughts, compulsive
                acts and physical ailments without
                having any objective evidence of
                disease --

                          MIKE
                Again, I just told you I'm in love
                with you and you're standing here
                giving me a vocabulary lesson.
                    (to the Pilot)
                Back me up on this, buddy...who
                here is afraid?

                           PILOT
                I'm just going to drink my
                champagne.

                     (skeptical)
                You're in love with me.      Really.
                Why?

                          MIKE
                Beats the shit out of me, but I am.

      Abby opens her mouth, about to make a retort, then realizes
      what's been said to her. For the first time in her life, she
      stops thinking and --

      Grabs Mike and kisses the hell out of him. The sheer force of
      her kissing THROWS them into the pilot, causing --

      The torch to FLAME radically.

      The balloon WHOOSHES upwards.
                                                                115.

      Abby finally loosens her grip on Mike. Hair askew, he looks a
      little like he's been hit by a cyclone.

                          ABBY
                    (breathless)
                If you say "just kidding", I'm
                going to throw you out of this
                balloon and watch your body
                splatter to the ground.

                          MIKE
                Are you going to threaten me with
                death when we have sex? Because it
                might be distracting.

      The Pilot looks worried for his safety.

                          PILOT
                May I suggest you wait until we
                land?

      Abby and Mike keep kissing as the balloon sails into the
      sunset, and we FADE TO BLACK, then CUT TO --

      CLOSE ON Mike, as he addresses the camera. He holds a mic,
      wears a tuxedo and speaks in a hushed voice.

                             MIKE
                   As many of you know, sometimes a
                   guy's gotta admit what he thought
                   was the truth isn't necessarily the
                   whole truth. Yes, women have a
                   checklist, but sometimes that list
                   includes a foul-mouthed idiot who
                   took way too long to realize he was
                   in love.
                       (holds up a finger)
                   Let's continue this conversation in
                   a second.

      WE PULL BACK to REVEAL --

      Mike is standing in a garden with rows and rows of WEDDING
      GUESTS seated behind him. An altar with flowers and a
      minister wait patiently.

      Mike gestures for the camera to follow him as he makes his
      way up to the altar.

      As he arrives he greets his groomsman, JONAH, also wearing a
      tux. He only has eyes for Joy, Abby's bridesmaid.

                             JONAH
                       (to Joy)
                   Has anyone ever told you you have a
                   stupendous bosom?

                             JOY
                   Not lately, so feel free to say it
                   again.

      A string quartet's version of "HERE COMES THE BRIDE" begins,
      as we PAN OVER to see --

      ABBY, in a wedding dress, about to make her way up the aisle.
      Looking absolutely beautiful.

                             MIKE
                       (wowed; to camera)
                   Zoom in on this, guys. I want the
                   whole city to see how lucky I am.

      The cameraman ZOOMS IN on Abby, as she catches Mike's eye and
      smiles.

      IN THE AUDIENCE, Elizabeth takes photo after photo. Her date
      -- a dead ringer for Jim Morrison -- looks at her, amused.

                What? No one's ever going to

      AT THE ALTAR, Abby finally arrives and looks at Mike.

                No, what's Jorge doing so close?
                We need a master.

                    (surprised)
                You knew about this?

                Hello...I'm the producer. It's
                sweeps week. How do you think I
                got them to pay for this?

      She gestures to -- BOB and HAROLD from Corporate, who sit in
      the audience.

      Mike looks momentarily surprised, then --

                          MIKE
                God, I love you.

      He turns to the camera.

                          MIKE
                So, here it is, guys. The games,
                the manipulation, the ploys, the
                tactics... all the things we do to
                think we're in control. But guess
                what? We never are.

UN SINGE EN HIVER (1962)

                       D'après le roman de Antoine BLONDIN

                            Adaptation : François BOYER

                    Scénario : François BOYER & Henri VERNEUIL

          LOGO DE « UFA COMACICO »
                         
          Le logo de « UFA Comacico » représente un éléphant de cirque
          devant un rideau de scène. Il lève la patte et la trompe, et il
          barrit.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - PLAGE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Plan d'une portion déserte de la plage. Une ponton en béton part
          de la plage et s'avance dans la mer. Un soldat allemand, en tenue
          de guerre, marche sur le ponton en direction de la mer.
                         
          Le générique apparaît en lettres blanches majuscules. Les noms des
          acteurs et des techniciens sont inscrits dans de petits cadres
          noirs, juste à la taille des noms. Ces cadres sont légèrement
          transparents, ce qui permet de voir le décor sous le cadre.
                         
          En bordure de plage, un escalier remonte de la plage. Un officier
          allemand remonte cet escalier. Suite du générique.
                         
          Plan d'ensemble de la plage avec un grand mur de pierre en premier
          plan. Au loin, un groupe de soldats allemands marchent le long de
          la mer, venant vers nous. Suite du générique.
                         
          Autre plan d'ensemble de la plage, vu de la promenade du bord de
          plage. Deux soldats allemands discutent devant une barrière
          amovible, qui barre le début de la route côtière. En bas de la
          rampe qui mène vers la plage, un motocycliste, sur sa moto,
          discute avec un autre soldat allemand à pied. La moto démarre et
          remonte vers la promenade. La moto sort du champ sur la droite.
          Suite du générique.
                         
          La moto roule sur la route côtière le long de la plage. En
          contrebas, le groupe de soldats continue à marcher le long de la
          mer. Au loin, sur la corniche, on aperçoit des maisons normandes
          typiques. La moto sort du champ vers la gauche, et les soldats
          vers la droite. Suite du générique.
                         
          Autre plan d'ensemble. Au premier plan, un soldat allemand monte
          la garde devant une barrière qui interdit l'accès à la plage. Sur
          la droite du soldat, le dos de la rangée de cabines de plage. Plus
          loin, deux autres soldats discutent devant une autre barrière.
          Dans le lointain, la corniche avec les maisons dessus. Une voiture
          longe les barrières, se dirigeant vers la corniche. Travelling sur
          la droite. Collé sur le côté de la première cabine de la rangée,
          nous voyons une affiche représentant des soldats allemands en
          uniforme de guerre. Sur l'affiche est écrit : « Avec tes camarades
          Européens, sous le signe SS, tu vaincras ! » Le travelling
          continue à se déplacer vers la droite. Devant la rangée de
          cabines, nous découvrons la promenade de bord de mer. Au fond,
          derrière la dernière cabine de la rangée, quatre soldats allemands
          montent la garde devant une barrière amovible. Le travelling
          s'arrête. Suite du générique.
                         
          Plan de demi-ensemble de la plage. Le groupe de soldats allemands
          marchent à la queue-leu-leu le long de la mer. Suite du générique.
                         
          Une jolie maison normande en bordure de mer. Elle est de taille
          assez imposante. Travelling sur la droite montrant l'entrée du
          village. Suite du générique.
                         
          Une ambulance, suivie d'une moto avec side-car et deux soldats à
          bord, entre dans le village par la route côtière. Sur le bord de
          la route, un panneau sur lequel est inscrit : « Tigreville ». Une
          moto double l'ambulance.
                         
          Contrechamp de la route côtière, qui monte vers le village. La
          moto roule vers nous, précédant l'ambulance, elle-même précédée
          par une autre moto avec side-car. Sur le bord de la route, un
          crucifix de grande hauteur. Suite du générique.
                         
          Plan général de la plage, vue du haut de la corniche, avec
          quelques toits de maison en premier plan. On aperçoit le groupe de
          soldats allemands, semblable, à cette distance, à un petit groupe
          de fourmis.
                         
          Fin du générique.
                         
          BAR « CHINOIS » - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Plan d'ensemble de l'escalier un peu rustique qui monte vers une
          grande bâtisse isolée au sommet d'une colline déserte, près de la
          mer et légèrement en dehors du village. Il s'agit d'un bar dit
          « chinois », en fait une maison « de rendez-vous ». Une jeune
          femme en imperméable monte l'escalier. A côté de l'escalier, une
          tour métallique supporte un bloc de sirènes.
          Contrechamp sur la femme qui monte l'escalier. En contrebas, des
          voitures militaires et des soldats allemands. La femme est
          Georgina, la « tenancière » du bar.
                         
          BAR « CHINOIS » - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Plan moyen sur la porte d'entrée qui s'ouvre et Georgina qui
          entre. Elle referme la porte derrière elle. Dans le petit couloir
          menant au bar, elle croise un officier allemand, qui la salue.
          Elle lui dit deux ou trois mots en allemand et lui sourit.
          L'officier sort et referme la porte derrière lui. Georgina
          remarque un casque colonial accroché sur un porte-manteau, fait
          une petite moue d'agacement et se dirige vers le bar en enlevant
          ses gants.
                         
          La décoration de la salle de bar est assez conventionnelle. Seuls
          quelques éléments donne une touche un peu asiatique à
          l'établissement, comme les lustres chinois qui pendent du plafond,
          ou la fresque qui couvre tout le mur derrière le bar.
                         
          Il n'y a que deux clients assis devant le bar : Albert Quentin et
          Lucien Esnault. Ils sont en train de boire, et sont déjà
          passablement éméchés. Les deux hommes paraissent dans la
          quarantaine. En fait, les deux acteurs, Jean Gabin et Paul
          Frankeur, ont été artificiellement rajeunis par les maquilleuses,
          de façon à paraître environ quinze ans plus jeunes que leur âge
          réel.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Matelot Esnault Lucien, veuillez armer la jonque, on
           appareille dans cinq minutes.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           C'est parti.
                         
          Il salue et se lève avec une certaine difficulté, traverse la
          pièce et se dirige, avec une démarche mal assurée, vers une jonque
          posée sur une étagère. Cette jonque est un modèle réduit de taille
          assez importante, mesurant environ 70 centimètres de la proue à la
          poupe. Il la prend et vient la poser sur le comptoir du bar.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Voilà !
                         
          Le « zinc » du comptoir forme un creux avec un rebord, tout autour
          du comptoir, d'environ cinq centimètres de hauteur. Albert prend
          un pichet publicitaire « Marie Brizard », et commence à verser de
          l'eau dans le creux du comptoir. Lucien prend un autre pichet et
          en fait autant de l'autre côté de la jonque. Georgina, qui vient
          d'enlever son imperméable, s'approche d'eux et ne semble pas ravie
          de voir ce qu'ils sont en train de faire.
                         
                          GEORGINA
           Albert !
                         
          Elle parle avec un léger accent étranger.
                         
                          GEORGINA
           Oh, je vous en prie, vous n'allez pas encore tout me
           saloper comme l'autre fois !
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Madame, le droit de navigation sur le Yang-Tsé-Kiang nous
           est formellement reconnu par la convention du 3 août 1885.
           Contesteriez-vous la chose ?
                         
          D'un revers de main, il fait tomber les trois bouteilles vide qui
          étaient sur le comptoir.
                         
                          GEORGINA
           Je ne conteste rien, je vous demande simplement de ne pas
           tout me casser comme l'autre jour.
                         
          Albert se retourne vers elle. Lucien aussi se retourne, mais plus
          lentement, et le regard un peu vague, alors qu'Albert, malgré
          qu'il soit visiblement ivre, garde le regard alerte.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ohhh mais pardon ! L'autre jour les hommes de Sun-Yat-Sen
           ont voulu jouer aux cons. Heureusement que j'ai brisé la
           révolte dans l'oeuf. Sans barbarie inutile d'ailleurs. On
           n'a coupé que les mauvaises têtes, le matelot Esnault peut
           témoigner.
                         
          Il le désigne du doigt, et Lucien lève une main hésitante comme
          pour prêter serment.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Sur l'honneur !
                         
          Albert contourne le comptoir.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Bon. Nous allons donc poursuivre notre mission
           civilisatrice.
                         
          Il est maintenant derrière le comptoir.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et d'abord je vais vous donner les dernières instructions
           de l'amiral Guépratte, rectifiées par le quartier-maître
           Quentin ici présent. Voilà... L'intention de l'amiral
           serait que nous percions un canal souterrain qui relirait
           le Wang-Hu au Yang-Tsé-Kiang !
                         
          Du doigt, il désigne le fleuve dessiné sur la fresque murale
          derrière lui.
                         
          Lucien essaie de répéter le mot « Yang-Tsé-Kiang », mais sa
          bouche, empâtée par l'alcool, a du mal à prononcer un mot aussi
          compliqué. Georgina le regarde en souriant.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Bon !
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Je ne vous apprendrai rien en vous rappelant que Wang-Hu
           veut dire dire fleuve jaune et Yang-Tse-Kiang, fleuve bleu.
           Je ne sais pas si vous vous rendez compte de l'aspect
           grandiose du mélange ? Un fleuve vert ! Vert comme les
           forêts, comme l'espérance. Matelot Esnault, nous allons
           repeindre l'Asie, lui donner une couleur tendre, nous
           allons installer le printemps dans ce pays de merde !
                         
          Il s'énerve un peu sur les derniers mots et désigne, de nouveau,
          la fresque murale du doigt.
                         
          Georgina sort de la salle du bar.
                         
                          GEORGINA
           Bon, je vois que vous êtes raisonnables, je vous laisse.
           J'ai des clients à servir, moi !
                         
          Albert sort de derrière le comptoir et crie :
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Hé !... Dites donc, l'indigène ! Un peu de tact, hein !
                         
          Il la suit dans la salle voisine.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Parlons d'autre chose... parce qu'on les connaît vos
           clients, la Wehrmacht polissonne et le Feldwebel
           escaladeur ! Hein !
                         
          Il s'est approché de l'escalier que Georgina a commencé à monter.
          Du doigt, il désigne le haut de l'escalier. Lucien l'a suivi.
          Gergina se retourne, un peu effrayée. De la main, elle lui fait
          signe de baisser le ton.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et puis merde, je vous raconterai plus rien, là !
                         
          Il retourne vers le bar.
                         
                          GEORGINA
           Chhhhut ! Albert ! Vous fâchez pas !
                         
          Albert revient un peu sur ses pas.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Vous fâchez pas, vous fâchez pas... Mais, nom de Dieu de
           bordel, je vous offre des rivières tricolores, des
           montagnes de fleurs et des temples sacrés, et vous me
           transformez tout ça en maison de passe ! Vous plantez votre
           Babylone normande dans ma mer de Chine. Alors... Matelot
           Esnault !
                         
          Lucien salue Albert.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Oui Chef !
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Reprenez le village ! Où sont les grenades que je les
           dégoupille ?
                         
          Il revient vers le bar, suivi par Lucien. Georgina, toujours
          plantée sur les premières marches de l'escalier, les regarde avec
          un peu d'inquiétude.
                         
          Albert ramasse une bouteille de vin sur une table. Lucien en
          ramasse une autre. Albert s'approche du bar et enlève le bouchon
          de sa bouteille avec les dents, comme s'il s'agissait de la
          goupille d'une grenade. Lucien en fait autant avec une autre
          bouteille. Les deux hommes s'apprêtent à lancer les bouteilles
          contre la fresque murale.
                         
           GEORGINA (criant en voix off)
           Monsieur Quentin !...
                         
          Elle s'approche des deux hommes, qui se retournent.
                         
                          GEORGINA
           Calmez-vous ! Je vous demande pardon.
                         
          Sa voix se fait suppliante et elle joint les mains. Albert enlève
          le bouchon qu'il avait gardé coincé entre les dents.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Une reddition ? Soit. La main de fer dans le gant de
           velours. Matelot, à vos pagaies !
                         
          Il se rassoit au comptoir, Lucien l'imite.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Oui Chef !
                         
          Ils versent chacun du vin dans leur verre à partir la bouteille
          qu'ils ont en main. Ils posent leurs bouteilles respectives, puis
          se mettent à boire. Lucien se lève avec difficulté, et, en
          titubant, tend les mains vers la jonque sur le comptoir. Albert
          l'observe.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Attention aux roches ! Et surtout attention aux mirages !
           Le Yang-Tsé-Kiang n'est pas un fleuve, c'est une avenue,
           une avenue de cinq milles kilomètres qui dégringole du
           Tibet pour finir dans la mer jaune...
                         
          Albert a soulevé la jonque du bar avec délicatesse et lenteur.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           ... avec des jonques et puis des sampans de chaque côté.
           Puis au milieu, il y a des... des tourbillons d'îles
           flottantes avec des orchidées hautes comme les arbres. Le
           Yang-Tsé-Kiang, camarade, c'est des millions de mètres
           cubes d'or et de fleurs qui descendent vers Nankin. Puis
           avec, tout le long, des villes-pontons où on peut tout
           acheter... des... alcool de riz... la religion, puis les
           garces et l'opium.
                         
          Il se tourne vers Georgina, toujours debout derrière eux. Lucien
          repose la jonque sur le comptoir et se retourne aussi.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Je peux vous affirmer, tenancière, que le fusilier des
           marins a été longtemps l'élément décoratif des maisons de
           thé. En ce temps-là, on savait rire ! « Elle s'était mis
           sur la paille pour un maquereau roux et rose, c'était un
           juif qui sentait l'ail ! Il l'avait, venant de Formose,
           tiré d'un bordel de Shangaï. »
                         
          Georgina a l'air ému.
                         
                          GEORGINA
           Oh, c'est beau !
                         
          Albert commence lentement à se diriger vers la sortie.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           C'est pas de moi ! J'ai des vapes comme ça qui me
           reviennent quand je descends le fleuve !
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Je croyais que c'était une avenue ?
                         
          Albert a mis une cigarette entre ses lèvres. Il écarte les bras
          avec une moue dubitative. Puis il prend un air pensif.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           On sait pas ! C'est peut-être un rêve qui se jette dans la
           mer.
                         
          On entend la sirène d'alerte qui se met en marche.
                         
          BAR « CHINOIS » - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Plan rapproché sur la sirène située à côté du bar « chinois ».
          Travelling à droite, montrant la mer dans le lointain. On entend
          d'autres sirènes qui sonnent aussi.
                         
          Plan général du ciel au-dessus de Tigreville. Une escadrille
          d'avions volent dans le ciel.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - PLAGE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Une grosse « jeep » allemande vient de s'arrêter au bord de la
          plage. Des soldats armés en descendent rapidement, sous les ordres
          d'un officier.
                         
                          OFFICIER ALLEMAND
           Schnell !...
                         
          Les soldats et l'officier descendent en courant vers la plage.
          D'autres officiers descendent derrière eux.
                         
          BAR « CHINOIS » - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Plan en contre-plongée de l'escalier. Une femme en robe de
          chambre, puis un officier allemand, sortent d'une chambre sur le
          palier. L'officier finit d'enfiler ses bottes. D'autres filles en
          robe de chambre et d'autres officiers sortent de chambres
          voisines, et commencent à descendre l'escalier. On entend les
          officiers parler allemand sur un ton assez énervé. Les filles
          aussi semblent énervées, mais le brouhaha ambiant fait que l'on
          peut à peine distinguer leurs paroles.
                         
                          UNE FILLE
           Hé ! Attendez-moi !
                         
          Plan rapproché sur l'arrière des marches de l'escalier, à travers
          lesquelles on voit les jambes des filles et des officiers qui
          descendent rapidement, et en arrière-plan, le visage un peu ahuri
          de Lucien, et celui, plus moqueur d'Albert.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Achtung, monsieur ! Achtung !
                         
          Georgina, venant du bar, vient vers eux en courant.
                         
                          GEORGINA
           Allez ! Allez ! Descendez dans la cave.
                         
          Albert fait un geste évasif, ramasse son casque colonial accroché
          au porte-manteau, et se dirige tranquillement vers la sortie,
          suivi de Lucien.
                         
          La porte est restée ouverte après le départ des officiers
          allemands, et Albert sort dehors, suivi de Lucien.
          BAR « CHINOIS » - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Albert et Lucien s'arrête devant l'entrée du bar, et regardent
          autour d'eux. On entend les moteurs des avions alliés. Derrière
          eux, on voit se fermer la porte du bar. Les deux hommes lèvent la
          tête.
                         
          Contrechamp sur le ciel au-dessus d'eux, dans lequel on voit trois
          avions voler côte à côte.
                         
          Retour sur les deux hommes. Derrière eux, un officier allemand
          retardataire sort en courant du bar.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Ils bombardent Le Havre.
                         
          Dans le ciel, un avion largue des bombes.
                         
          Retour sur les deux hommes.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Le Havre ! Le Havre ! T'es complètement bourré ! Le Havre,
           c'est de l'autre côté. Ça nous tombe sur la gueule, oui !
                         
          Il s'éloigne rapidement. Lucien le suit.
                         
          Ils s'arrêtent un peu plus loin sur la colline qui surplombe la
          mer. Albert met sa main en visière pour regarder le ciel.
                         
          Dans le ciel, un autre avion largue des bombes.
                         
          Retour sur les deux hommes. Albert fait signe à Lucien de
          s'allonger par terre.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Couchez-vous !
                         
          Ils s'aplatissent par terre, juste au moment où une bombe tombe
          non loin d'eux.
                         
          Plan rapproché sur les deux hommes allongés dans l'herbe,
          environnés d'une épaisse fumée. Lucien a les mains sur la tête.
                         
          Dans le ciel, un autre avion passe rapidement en larguant des
          bombes.
                         
          Retour sur la colline. Une autre bombe tombe près du bar
          « chinois ».
                         
          Plan rapproché sur les deux hommes. La fumée se dissipe un peu.
          Lucien est couvert d'herbe et de branchages. Albert relève
          lentement la tête. On entend les rafales des mitrailleuses anti-
          aériennes. Puis d'autres bruits mêlés de bombes, de coups de canon
          et de tir de DCA. Les deux hommes se relèvent et s'éloignent.
                         
          Dans le ciel, un autre avion largue des bombes.
                         
          Plan moyen sur Albert et Lucien, qui se cachent derrière un talus,
          toujours sur la colline. On voit la plage en contrebas, avec les
          bombes qui explosent. Les deux hommes, allongés sur le ventre, se
          couvrent la tête de leurs mains.
                         
          Dans le ciel, deux avions larguent des bombes.
                         
          Retour sur Albert et Lucien, qui n'ont pas bougé de place. Les
          bombes continuent à éclater autour d'eux sur le flanc de la
          colline.
                         
          Plan moyen en contre-plongée du bar « chinois ». Une bombe éclate
          tout près de lui.
                         
          Plan rapproché d'Albert et Lucien, que l'on aperçoit au milieu
          d'une épaisse fumée. Ils se redressent lentement.
                         
          Plan général de la plage et de ses abords, en contrebas de la
          colline. La DCA allemande tire en continu.
                         
          Plan rapproché sur Lucien, qui relève la tête vers le ciel. Albert
          l'imite.
                         
          Dans le ciel, un avion vole au milieu des parachutes qui
          descendent lentement vers le sol.
                         
          Retour sur Albert et Lucien, qui regardent vers la plage.
                         
          Plan d'ensemble des canons anti-aériens, qui tirent vers le ciel.
                         
          Dans le ciel, un avion prend un long virage. Il largue un
          parachute.
                         
          Plan rapproché d'Albert et Lucien, qui se protègent la tête de
          leurs mains. Albert rampe lentement vers le bas et passe derrière
          Lucien.
                         
          Plan rapproché d'Albert caché dans un creux d'herbes. Lucien
          descend vers lui. Ils regardent tous deux vers le ciel.
                         
          Dans le ciel, une imposante escadrille d'avions approche de la
          côte.
                         
          Retour sur les deux hommes. Albert semble réfléchir.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Dis donc, il serait peut-être temps d'aller retrouver nos
           bonnes femmes. Elles doivent s'inquiéter.
                         
          Il se relève.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Y aurait comme de quoi.
                         
          Il se lève à son tour.
                         
          A quatre pattes, les deux hommes remontent vers le chemin. Un
          mouvement de caméra permet de découvrir, devant eux, une petite
          maison, autour de laquelle les bombes explosent. Devant la maison,
          est garé un véhicule militaire. Une moto s'éloigne de la maison.
          Lucien et Albert descendent lentement vers le terre-plein autour
          de la maison. On entend une ambulance. Lucien et Albert sont
          maintenant sur le terre-plein et marchent tranquillement vers la
          maison.

          Plan rapproché sur une tour, qui pourrait être le clocher d'une
          l'église (?), et d'où sortent des flammes. Derrière ce
          « clocher », un escalier qui descend vers le centre ville. Albert
          et Lucien descendent l'escalier.

          Plan de demi-ensemble d'une rue jonchée de débris et de deux
          voitures en flamme. Derrière ces voitures, le bas d'un escalier
          sur lequel Albert et Lucien apparaissent. Ils marchent entre les
          deux voitures en flamme. Bruit d'une grosse explosion.

          d'énorme gerbes d'eau.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - RUES BOMBARDÉES - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Albert continue sa progression entre les deux voitures en flamme.
          Lucien le suit à une certaine distance.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Voilà que ça repart !
                         
          Albert se tourne vers lui.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et puisque je te dis que c'est rien.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           C'est rien, c'est rien...
          Albert fait un geste autoritaire des deux bras.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Rien !
                         
          Il repart, suivi de Lucien.
                         
          Plan d'ensemble des ruines d'une maison. Les deux hommes circulent
          entre ces ruines. Derrière eux, un bâtiment de trois étages en
          flammes. On entend des tirs de mitrailleuse. Albert se retourne
          vers Lucien, qui tripote sa cravate.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ben, qu'est-ce que tu fous avec ta cravate ?
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Je veux pas mourir débraillé.
                         
          Il rejoint Albert.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oui, et bien tu feras ta toilette de mort plus tard. Allez,
           magne-toi.
                         
          Il reprend sa marche, et descend vers une autre maison en ruines,
          suivi de Lucien. Ils atteignent une zone où une épaisse fumée
          permet à peine de les distinguer

          Plan d'ensemble d'une esplanade, sur laquelle se trouvent deux
          chars allemands abandonnés. Albert et Lucien traversent cette
          esplanade. A l'extrémité de l'esplanade, ils montent une rampe qui
          rejoint des bâtiments. Des bombes tombent autour des chars
          abandonnés.
                         
          Dans le ciel, une escadrille d'avion est doublée par une autre
          escadrille plus rapide.
                         
          Une bombe explose sur le sol.
                         
          Dans le ciel, trois avions piquent vers le sol.
                         
          Plan moyen d'Albert et Lucien montant la rampe au sein d'une
          épaisse fumée. Albert lève les yeux vers le ciel.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh, merde !
                         
          Il fait semblant de tirer vers le ciel avec une mitraillette
          imaginaire.
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta !...
                         
          Dans le ciel, un avion pique vers le sol.
                         
          Retour sur Albert qui s'est remis en marche. Lucien regarde
          l'avion. On entend son moteur s'emballer.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Oh !... Albert !
                         
          Mais Albert s'est remis en marche et est déjà loin devant Lucien.
                         
          Plan, dans le ciel, de l'avion qui descend en piqué et s'écrase en
          mer.
                         
          Retour sur Lucien qui court après Albert.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Albert !
                         
          Il marche en tendant le bras en arrière, car, dans son délire
          d'ivrogne, il semble persuadé que c'est Albert, avec sa
          mitraillette imaginaire, qui a descendu l'avion !
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT

          fumée, et au milieu de laquelle on distingue à peine les deux
          silhouettes d'Albert et de Lucien. Des gens courent autour d'eux
          pour aller se mettre à l'abri.

          Plus tard. La nuit est tombée.
                         
          Plan rapproché en contre-plongée sur l'angle de deux rues. Une
          plaque, apposée au premier étage du mur de la maison, indique le
          nom de la rue : « Rue du Maréchal Pétain ».
                         
          La caméra descend au niveau du sol, et montre d'autres pancartes,
          installées au niveau du rez-de-chaussée à l'angle de la rue, et
          qui donnent des indications en allemand. Un groupe de soldats
          allemands casqués courent dans la rue, au milieu des flammes. Il
          passent devant une maison avec une grande vitrine. Au-dessus de
          cette vitrine, une inscription : « Hôtel Stella ».
                         
          Gros plan en contre-plongée d'une enseigne accrochée au mur de
          cette maison, et sur laquelle on peut lire, en lettres blanches
          sur fond noir : « Hotel Stella - Pension - Restaurant - Garage ».
                         
          Retour au niveau de la rue, dans laquelle circulent des motos de
          l'armée allemande. Derrière le passage des motards, un pan de
          maison s'écroule en flammes. Un homme à la jambe bandée traverse
          la rue en s'aidant de deux béquilles. Des soldats allemands
          casqués courent dans le sens inverse du premier groupe. On entend
          la voix d'Albert chanter à tue-tête :
           ALBERT QUENTIN (voix off)
           It's a long way to Tipperary...
                         
          Un soupirail vu à travers les jambes des soldats qui courent.
          Albert passe la tête par le soupirail et chante. Derrière lui, on
          distingue sa femme Suzanne.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           It's a long way to go...
                         
          Zoom avant sur le soupirail. On voit plus distinctement Albert
          accroché des deux mains aux barreaux du soupirail et continuant à
          chanter.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           It's a long way to Tipperary... Et good-bye Piccadilly !...
                         
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - CAVE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Plan d'ensemble d'une cave voûtée, dont le plafond est supporté
          par de gros piliers de briques. Sur des étagères sont alignées de
          nombreuses bouteilles de vins. Des toiles d'araignées pendent du
          plafond. Au fond de la cave, debout devant le soupirail, Albert
          continue à chanter.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           It's a long way to gooo !...
                         
          Il revient vers l'intérieur de la cave, où sa femme, Suzanne, est
          assise.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Aux chiottes, les teutons !... Bande de mange-merde !
                         
          Il se sert un verre de vin, à partir d'une bouteille posée sur un
          tonneau.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Arrête, Albert ! Tu vas nous faire fusiller !
                         
          Par le soupirail ouvert, on voit les jambes des gens qui circulent
          dans la rue.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et pas de bandeau sur les yeux, je commanderai le peloton
           moi-même, comme le Maréchal Ney !
                         
          Il pointe le doigt vers son coeur.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Droit au coeur, messieurs.
                         
          Suzanne reste assise, enveloppée dans un grand châle de laine.
          Elle semble mal à son aise.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Si tu crois que c'est le moment de faire le zouave.
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Je me demande, madame, ce que les Zouaves viennent faire
           la-dedans ! Quartier-maître Quentin, du Corps
           Expéditionnaire d'Extrême-Orient... Garde à vous ! Envoyez
           les couleurs !
                         
          Il porte une bouteille à ses lèvres comme s'il s'agissait d'une
          trompette, et chante la sonnerie de l'envoi des couleurs. Suzanne
          le regarde en haussant les épaules.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ta-ta, tagada-dein-dein, ta-ta, tarrrrein-tein, ta-ta,
           tarra-da-da, ta-ta, tarrein-tein.
                         
          Il baisse sa bouteille.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Repos !
                         
          Une bombe a dû tomber très près de chez eux, car le bruit est plus
          fort, les bouteilles sont agitées sur leurs étagères, et une pluie
          de plâtre tombe du plafond. Albert sursaute et se tourne vers la
          pluie de plâtre.
                         
          Une autre bombe tombe près de chez eux. Et cette fois-ci, c'est
          derrière Suzanne que tombe la pluie de plâtre.
                         
          Une autre bombe éclate. Deux pluies de plâtre en deux endroits
          différents de la cave. Des bouteilles tombent par terre et se
          brisent.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           La rigolade s'organise.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Ce matin, chez le boucher, on disait que les Allemands
           allaient tout faire sauter avant de partir.
                         
          Albert lève la main d'un geste impérial.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mais c'est leur droit. Moi, je dis que le soldat en fuite a
           droit à certaines compensations récréatives.
                         
          Il ramasse son verre sur le tonneau, et se dirige vers Suzanne.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Personnellement, je me suis tapé de sévères courettes, je
           connais la question.
                         
          Il s'assoit sur un casier à bouteilles.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Si tu buvais moins, t'aurais peur comme tout le monde.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ouais, et bien si je buvais moins, je serais un autre
           homme.
                         
          Il débouche la bouteille, qui lui avait servi de trompette
          improvisée, et remplit son verre.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et j'y tiens pas.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Si tu trouves ça intelligent de mourir saoul !... Je te
           jures, ça fera bonne impression en ville. Tu sais ce qu'on
           dira ?
                         
          Il se lève et regarde sa femme avec un air important.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mourir saoul, c'est mourir debout, et je me fous des
           racontars ! L'histoire jugera, madame, et d'ailleurs, je ne
           vois pas pourquoi je boirais moins aujourd'hui...
                         
          Il porte le verre à ses lèvres, mais le redescend aussitôt, car
          une grosse pluie de plâtre s'abat derrière lui. Il s'éloigne en
                         CRIANT :
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ils vont tout foutre en l'air, ces cons-là !
                         
          Une autre pluie de plâtre s'abat sur l'escalier.
                         
          Suzanne se lève d'un bond. Elle bute sur un tonneau et se retourne
          au moment où un autre pluie de plâtre s'abat derrière elle.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - RUE HÔTEL STELLA - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Dans la rue, trois soldats en armes courent dans tous les sens.
          L'un d'eux crie quelque chose en allemand, mais une bombe tombe
          dans la rue et les tue tous les trois.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - CAVE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Albert boit tranquillement son verre au milieu du vacarme et du
          plâtre qui continue à tomber du plafond. Suzanne se précipite sur
          lui et le prend par le bras. Elle semble effrayée.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Albert, j'ai peur !
                         
          Il la regarde longuement avant de répondre :
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Bois !
                         
          Un autre bruit de bombe, et toute la vaisselle de service en métal
          de l'hôtel dégringole dans l'escalier de la cave, accompagnée des
          valises dans lesquelles elle était rangée.
                         
          La lampe d'éclairage de la cave se balance sur son fil, puis
          s'éteint.
                         
          Dans la pénombre, où l'on ne distingue plus que la lumière de la
          rue filtrant par la lucarne, on entend Albert crier : « Oh ! »,
          puis Suzanne se met à sangloter tout en toussant à cause de la
          poussière. On aperçoit la lueur d'une bougie qu'Albert vient
          d'allumer au fond de la cave. Les sanglots de Suzanne sont devenus
          presque hystériques.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ben, Suzanne, où que t'es, ma Suzanne ?... Ben,
           Suzanne !... Hein ?
                         
          Il se rapproche de l'endroit d'où proviennent les sanglots et la
          toux de Suzanne.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ah !...
                         
          Il vient de la repérer, assise près d'une étagère, et sanglotant
          toutes les larmes de son corps.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Écoute-moi bien, ma Suzanne...
                         
          Suzanne relève la tête et le regarde.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ce que je vais te dire, c'est sérieux, et puis... c'est
           même grave. Si on s'en sort, hein... si la maison tient
           debout, et puis, si, un jour, je peux rallumer l'enseigne
           qui est au-dessus de la porte... et bien, je te jure de ne
           plus toucher un verre... Jamais...
                         
          Les sanglots de Suzanne se sont arrêtés. Elle regarde son mari,
          semblant, malgré elle, assez impressionnée par ce discours et
          cette gravité inhabituels.
                         
          Albert se sert un grand verre de vin à la lumière de la bougie. Il
          pose la bouteille sur le tonneau, et lève son verre en direction
          de Suzanne.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Tiens, regarde. C'est peut-être le dernier.
                         
          Il porte le verre à ses lèvres et le boit lentement.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - RUE HÔTEL STELLA - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Même plan rapproché que précédemment : contre-plongée du premier
          étage de l'immeuble au coin de la rue près de l'hôtel, avec la
          plaque indiquant le nom de la rue, qui est toujours : « Rue du
          Maréchal Pétain ».
                         
          Fondu au noir.
                         
          Le même plan réapparait, mais, cette fois-ci, le nom de la rue est
          devenu : « Rue du Général de Gaulle » !
                         
          La caméra descend au niveau de la rue, qui est très calme
          maintenant. Toutes les devantures des magasins ont été réparées,
          les impacts de bombe sur la chaussée ont été bouchés. Par contre,
          il pleut ! Un homme s'éloigne, marchant à grandes enjambées sous
          la pluie.
                         
          Plan rapproché en contre-plongée de l'enseigne de l'hôtel. Elle
          est maintenant rédigée en lettres noires sur fond blanc, mais le
          même texte est toujours inscrit : « Hôtel Stella - Pension -
          Restaurant - Garage ». Et elle est éclairée par une grosse
          ampoule. Albert a donc pu rallumer son enseigne, comme il le
          souhaitait.
                         
          DEAUVILLE - PLACE DE LA GARE - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Plan d'ensemble de la place de la gare de Deauville, qui est
          déserte. Seul, une DS Citroën est garée sur le parking, avec
          l'enseigne « Taxi » fixée sur le toit.
                         
          Plan moyen de l'entrée de la gare. Un homme jeune, dans la
          trentaine, sort de la gare, portant une valise. Il s'agit de
          Gabriel Fouquet. Il est engoncé dans son imperméable. Il regarde
          la pluie qui tombe avec une grimace de mécontentement. Il relève
          son col et se dirige vers le parking.
                         
          Il s'approche du taxi garé au milieu du parking. Il n'y a personne
          dans la voiture. Il pose sa valise par terre, ouvre la porte du
          conducteur et actionne le klaxon à plusieurs reprises.
          Plan moyen du « Café de la Gare ». Par les vitres du café, on voit
          un homme s'éloigner du comptoir et ouvrir la porte d'entrée. Il
          referme la porte et court vers son taxi.
                         
           LE CHAUFFEUR DE TAXI
           Voilà ! Voilà !
                         
          Il s'approche de sa voiture.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je vais à Tigreville.
                         
           LE CHAUFFEUR DE TAXI
           Montez !
                         
          Gabriel prend sa valise et ouvre la porte arrière. Le chauffeur
          ouvre sa portière avant.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           C'est loin ?
                         
           LE CHAUFFEUR DE TAXI
           Oh non... Six kilomètres.
                         
          Les deux hommes montent dans la voiture, qui démarre et sort du
          parking.
                         
          TAXI - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Gabriel s'est assis, non pas derrière le chauffeur, mais sur le
          siège voisin, de façon à pouvoir discuter plus facilement. Il
          regarde la route sombre et pluvieuse qui défile par les vitres du
          taxi, puis les premières maisons de Tigreville.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Vous croyez qu'on trouvera un hôtel ouvert dans le coin ?
                         
           LE CHAUFFEUR DE TAXI
           Oh... c'est pas la saison. Enfin, je vais vous montrer ce
           qui nous reste.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Le taxi passe devant le panneau qui indique l'entrée de
          Tigreville, et enfile la route qui monte vers le centre ville.
                         
          TAXI - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
           LE CHAUFFEUR DE TAXI
           Ça, en temps normal, c'est les Roches Noires. C'est ce
           qu'il y a de mieux, hein.
                         
          Par les vitres du taxi, on aperçoit l'hôtel des Roches Noires,
          dont tous les volets sont fermés.
                         
           LE CHAUFFEUR DE TAXI
           Seulement, ils ferment le quinze septembre. J'ai pas de
           conseil à vous donner, mais vous auriez mieux fait de
           rester à Deauville. D'ailleurs, y a encore des hôtels bien.
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           A Cannes aussi, ou à Palma. Malheureusement, j'ai rien à y
           faire.
                         
           LE CHAUFFEUR DE TAXI
           Moi, je vous disais ça, hein...
                         
          TIGREVILLE - RUE HÔTEL STELLA - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Le taxi s'approche de l'hôtel Stella, et s'arrête devant.
                         
          Le chauffeur se glisse sur le siège passager et ouvre la portière.
          Gabriel baisse sa vitre.
                         
           LE CHAUFFEUR DE TAXI
           Y a ça, chez Quentin...
                         
          Plan en contre-plongée de l'enseigne de l'hôtel, qui n'est plus
          éclairée.
                         
          Retour sur le taxi.
                         
           LE CHAUFFEUR DE TAXI
           C'est ouvert, mais je vous préviens, vous allez pas vous
           marrer.
                         
          Gabriel inspecte la devanture de l'hôtel.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je suis pas venu pour me marrer.
                         
           LE CHAUFFEUR DE TAXI
           Ah bon...
                         
          Le chauffeur sort de son taxi par la porte passager et la referme.
          Il lève la tête vers les fenêtres du premier étage, et appelle :
                         
           LE CHAUFFEUR DE TAXI
           Quentin !... Albert !... Albert !...
                         
          Plan, en contre-plongée, d'une fenêtre qui s'allume au premier
          étage, à côté de l'enseigne. La fenêtre s'ouvre, et Albert
          apparaît en pyjama rayé. L'acteur Jean Gabin a maintenant repris
          son aspect normal et ses cheveux blancs, et paraît donc son âge
          réel.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
                         
           LE CHAUFFEUR DE TAXI (voix off)
           Un client...
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Je descends.
                         
          Il rentre dans sa chambre.
                         
          Retour sur le taxi. Le chauffeur ouvre la porte de Gabriel, qui
          sort sa valise, que le chauffeur lui prend des mains. Puis Gabriel
          lui-même sort du taxi.
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je vous dois combien ?
                         
           LE CHAUFFEUR DE TAXI
           Quinze cents francs pour la course.
                         
          Gabriel sort des billets de sa poche.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Et cinq cents pour la conversation. Gardez tout.
                         
          Il met l'argent dans la main du chauffeur.
                         
           LE CHAUFFEUR DE TAXI
           Merci.
                         
          Ils se dirigent tous les deux vers la porte de l'hôtel.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - VESTIBULE DE RÉCEPTION - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Albert, qui a enfilé un blouson par-dessus son pyjama, se dirige
          vers la porte d'entrée. A sa gauche, le comptoir de la réception.
          Il ouvre la porte.
                         
           LE CHAUFFEUR DE TAXI
           Bonsoir, Albert.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Bonsoir.
                         
          Le chauffeur donne sa valise à Gabriel, et retourne vers son taxi.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Vous avez une chambre ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh la ! J'en ai quatorze ! Entrez, monsieur.
          Gabriel entre dans l'hôtel. Albert referme la porte derrière lui.
          Gabriel regarde le comptoir de réception. On entend sonner un
          carillon. Albert fait le tour du comptoir. Sur le mur, derrière le
          comptoir, l'horloge marque 10h30, et, sur le mur de côté, le
          calendrier indique : « jeudi 28 octobre ». Albert décroche une
          clef sur le tableau sous l'horloge. Il prend une fiche sur le
          comptoir, et refait le tour du comptoir.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Tenez, si vous voulez me suivre.
                         
          Il s'éloigne du comptoir et Gabriel le suit.
                         
          Plan en plongée vu du haut de l'escalier. Albert commence à
          monter, suivi de Gabriel.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Vous savez, si vous êtes venu pour les bains de mer, j'aime
           mieux vous dire que la saison est terminée.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire, la saison ? Les paysans disent
           qu'il y en a plus, de saison. Vous en avez encore une,
           vous ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Boh !... Du premier au quinze août, dans les années
           exceptionnelles.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - COULOIR PREMIER ÉTAGE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Ils sont arrivés au premier étage. Albert s'avance dans le
          couloir.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Vous gardez la chambre plusieurs jours ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je sais pas.
                         
          Albert s'arrête devant une porte et introduit la clef dans la
          serrure.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - CHAMBRE GABRIEL - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          La porte s'ouvre et Albert entre le premier.
                         
          La chambre est assez conventionnellement celle d'un hôtel de
          province de l'époque. Papier à grosses fleurs sur les murs, cadre
          avec une photo de voilier, un lavabo avec une tablette de verre et
          un miroir au-dessus, un lit à structure métallique, une table de
          nuit avec une lampe de chevet, une commode, un fauteuil en bois
          avec un coussin dessus, une table recouverte d'une nappe à motif
          moderne avec un cendrier publicitaire posé dessus.
                         
          Gabriel suit Albert et jette un rapide regard circulaire autour de
          lui.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Voilà...
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Ça m'a l'air parfait.
                         
          Il pose sa valise au pied du lit.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Je vous laisse votre fiche, vous la remplirez demain. Vous
           avez besoin de quelque chose ?
                         
          Albert a posé la fiche sur la table. Gabriel commence à
          déboutonner son imperméable.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Euh... Qu'est-ce qu'on peut boire à cette heure-ci ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh ben...Vittel, Evian, Perrier...
                         
          Gabriel finit d'enlever son imperméable.
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Oh... Tout compte fait, j'ai pas soif.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et ben, comme vous voudrez. Voilà...
                         
          Albert se dirige vers la porte.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Bonne nuit, monsieur.
                         
          Albert sort et referme la porte derrière lui. Gabriel pose son
          imperméable sur le bout du lit, et regarde autour de lui. Il met
          les mains dans ses poches, et s'adosse sur le lit.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - CHAMBRE ALBERT - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          La chambre d'Albert et Suzanne ne ressemble pas aux autres
          chambres de l'hôtel. Elle est moins impersonnelle, avec des
          meubles plus jolis et de nombreux vases et objet disposés dessus.
                         
          Albert entre et referme la porte derrière lui. On ne voit pas
          encore Suzanne, mais on devine qu'elle est toujours au lit, dont
          on aperçoit le pied à droite du champ.
                         
           SUZANNE QUENTIN (voix off venant du lit)
           Qui est-ce ?
                         
          Albert enlève son blouson, et s'avance dans la chambre, suivi par
          la caméra.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Un client.
                         
          On découvre Suzanne à moitié assise dans le lit. Elle a changé de
          coiffure et a maintenant les cheveux coupés courts, alors qu'elle
          les portait longs pendant la guerre.
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Je m'en doute. Il t'a rien dit ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ben, qu'est-ce que tu voulais qu'il me dise ? Il m'a
           demandé une chambre, je lui ai donné le huit.
                         
          Il pose son blouson sur un fauteuil.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Avoue que c'est quand même une drôle d'heure pour arriver,
           surtout de ce temps-là.
                         
          Albert s'assoit sur le lit et enlève ses pantoufles.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh... les voyageurs, c'est fait pour voyager, et puis le
           temps n'a rien à voir là-dedans.
                         
          Il se glisse sous les draps. Suzanne en fait de même.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Allez...
                         
          Il ramasse un bonbon dans une coupelle sur la table de nuit et le
          met dans sa bouche. Il se gratte la tête, puis éteint sa lampe de
          chevet. Suzanne a les yeux grand ouvert, et soudain, elle tourne
          la tête et tend l'oreille. On entend une porte qui se ferme, puis
          des bruits de parquet qui grince. Suzanne se redresse dans son
          lit. Albert ne bouge pas, un bras replié au-dessus de sa tête.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Écoute !...
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Quoi ?
                         
          Plan rapproché sur la porte de la chambre. On entend quelqu'un qui
          passe derrière la porte dans le couloir.
                         
          Suzanne se tourne vers Albert.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Tu vas tout de même pas me dire que tu trouves ça naturel ?
                         
          Albert n'a toujours pas bougé.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Qu'est-ce qu'il y a de surnaturel à chercher les waters ?
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Albert !...
                         
          Elle sort précipitamment du lit, et ramasse sa robe de chambre.
          Albert allume posément sa lampe de chevet.
                         
          Suzanne arrive près de la porte en finissant d'enfiler sa robe de
          chambre. Elle entr'ouvre doucement la porte et regarde dans le
          couloir. Elle fait signe à Albert de venir près d'elle.
          Albert se lève lentement, sort du lit, enfile ses pantoufles et
          rejoint Suzanne près de la porte. Il ouvre la porte en grand et
          sort dans le couloir. Suzanne le suit.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - COULOIR PREMIER ÉTAGE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          La caméra suit Albert et Suzanne dans le couloir. Ils arrivent à
          l'escalier. En contrebas, dans le hall de réception, on voit
          Gabriel, qui descend les dernières marches. Il regarde autour de
          lui. Il ouvre à deux battants les portes d'un placard, mais rien,
          dans ce placard, ne semble l'intéresser et il le referme. Il
          trouve un interrupteur et allume la lumière de la salle à manger.
          Il pénètre dans la salle à manger que l'on voit à travers le mur
          vitré qui la sépare du hall de réception. Albert et Suzanne
          s'accoudent sur la rampe pour mieux l'observer. Gabriel s'approche
          d'un buffet, dont il ouvre les portes. Il regarde à l'intérieur et
          referme le buffet.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - VESTIBULE DE RÉCEPTION - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Gabriel revient vers le hall de réception, et éteint la lumière
          avant de sortir. Une autre lumière s'allume au premier étage.
          Gabriel se retourne vers Albert et Suzanne, que l'on voit en
          contre-plongée en haut de l'escalier.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Vous cherchez quelque chose ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           La porte.
                         
          Albert montre quelque chose du doigt derrière Gabriel.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Droit devant vous.
                         
          Gabriel se retourne et se dirige vers la porte d'entrée.
                         
           ALBERT QUENTIN (voix off)
           Soyez aimable de la refermer, hein ?
                         
          Gabriel ouvre la porte, sort dans la rue, et referme la porte
          derrière lui.
                         
          Retour à la contre-plongée sur Albert et Suzanne, en haut de
          l'escalier. Albert pénètre dans le couloir, suivi de Suzanne.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - CHAMBRE ALBERT - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Par la fenêtre de la chambre d'Albert, on voit, en plongée,
          Gabriel qui marche dans la rue, où, maintenant, il ne pleut plus.
          Il se dirige vers un café situé à quelques mètres de l'hôtel, dans
          une rue qui coupe la rue de l'hôtel à angle droit, le « Café
          Normand ».
                         
          TIGREVILLE - RUE HÔTEL STELLA - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Contre-champ et plan rapproché sur la fenêtre d'Albert, vue de la
          rue. Albert et Suzanne regardent dans la rue, écartant chacun un
          rideau pour mieux voir.
          HOTEL STELLA - CHAMBRE ALBERT - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Retour au plan en plongée, vu de la fenêtre de la chambre. Gabriel
          est maintenant arrivé au café et regarde à travers les rideaux qui
          décorent les vitres de l'établissement. Puis il se dirige vers la
          porte qu'il ouvre.
                         
          CAFÉ NORMAND - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Le « Café Normand » est un petit bistro provincial typique de
          l'époque. Comptoir en bois avec « zinc » vraiment en zinc. Vitres
          protégés par des rideaux blancs bien repassés. Cendriers
          publicitaires « Picon » ou « Martini »sur le comptoir. Derrière le
          comptoir, des étagères avec des bouteilles d'alcool, des verres,
          une machine expresso, le tout devant un grand miroir qui couvre
          tout le mur.
                         
          Gabriel entre dans le café et referme la porte derrière lui.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Messieurs !...
          Il s'assoit sur un tabouret en bois devant le comptoir. Il se
          retourne lentement, car il vient de s'apercevoir que le brouhaha
          ambiant s'est tu soudainement à son entrée.
                         
          Contrechamp montrant la salle du café. Au fond, la salle de
          billard, communiquant sans séparation avec le reste de la salle du
          café, mais à laquelle on accède par trois marches. Deux hommes
          sont en train de jouer au billard. A côté du billard, une vieille
          femme, Joséphine, seule à une table. Le long du mur qui prolonge
          la vitrine du café, des tables, derrière lesquelles sont assis des
          clients, visiblement des marins, ou d'anciens marins, vu leur
          costumes et leurs casquettes. De l'autre côté de la salle, une
          table où le patron, Lucien Esnault, est en train de manger en face
          de son épouse, une femme brune au chignon sévère. Simone, la
          serveuse, une petite jeune femme blonde d'allure sympathique,
          portant un grand tablier blanc, et tenant un torchon à la main,
          quitte la table des « marins » et se dirige vers le comptoir.
          Joséphine, Madame Esnault et Simone sont les trois seules femmes
          présentes dans le café. Les conversations reprennent.
                         
          Retour sur Gabriel tourné vers le comptoir, derrière lequel Simone
          vient d'arriver.
                         
                          SIMONE
           Pour monsieur, ce sera ?...
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Un Picon-bière.
                         
          Simone reste interdite : elle semble ne pas savoir ce qu'est
          exactement un Picon-bière. Elle pose un verre sur le comptoir
          devant Gabriel. Puis, de dessous le comptoir, elle sort une
          bouteille d'un litre de bière, fermée par un bouchon mécanique.
          Elle ouvre la bouteille, qui fait un « pop » caractéristique. Elle
          se retourne pour prendre une bouteille de Picon sur l'étagère
          derrière elle. Elle débouche la bouteille, puis prend les deux
          bouteilles, une dans chaque main, et se tourne vers la salle.
                          SIMONE
           M'sieur Esnault... pour un Picon-bière, c'est moitié-
           moitié ?
                         
          Contre champ. La caméra est placée derrière Simone, et montre
          Gabriel en premier plan, assis devant le comptoir, et derrière
          lui, en arrière plan, la salle du café.
                         
          Gabriel prend les bouteilles des mains de Simone.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Ça peut le devenir, mais pas maintenant.
                         
          Il pose la bouteille de bière sur le comptoir, et commence à
          verser le Picon dans son verre.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je saute pas l'obstacle sans élan. Vous allez voir, j'ai ma
           recette.
                         
          Il pose la bouteille de Picon, prend la bouteille de bière et
          verse la bière dans son verre.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Pendant ce temps, faites-moi un numéro de téléphone.
                         
                          SIMONE
           Pour ici ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Non.
                         
                          SIMONE
           Pour Paris ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Non. Pour Madrid.
                         
          Il pose la bouteille de bière et sort, de la poche de sa veste, un
          papier qu'il tend à Simone.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Tenez, il est là-dessus.
                         
          Simone se dirige vers le téléphone, posé à l'extrémité du
          comptoir. Elle pose la main sur le téléphone, puis se tourne vers
          la salle.
                         
                          SIMONE
           M'sieur Esnault... Pour téléphoner à Madrid, comment on
           fait ?
                         
          Dans la salle, Lucien, toujours à table avec sa femme, et qui
          tourne le dos au comptoir, s'essuie la bouche et se lève de table.
          Il s'approche du comptoir, et actionne la manette d'appel du
          téléphone.
                         
          (NOTE - A cet époque, seules certaines grandes villes, comme
          Paris, avait un réseau téléphonique automatique. Pour la plupart
          des petites villes de province, il fallait passer par un standard,
          qui vous mettait en relation avec le correspondant demandé.)
                         
          Simone fait le tour du comptoir pour donner le papier de Gabriel à
          Lucien, qui le prend et décroche le combiné. Avant de parler, il
          se tourne vers la salle.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Un peu de silence, je téléphone en Espagne.
                         
          Les conversations s'arrêtent à la table des « marins », qui se
          tournent tous vers Lucien. Ce dernier, le combiné à la main,
          regarde le papier de Gabriel.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Mademoiselle Claire comment ?...
                         
          Il se tourne vers Gabriel.
                         
          Plan moyen de Gabriel, au comptoir, en train de boire son Picon-
          bière. Il baisse son verre.
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Claire Prévost.
                         
          Il recommence à boire lentement.

           Pour le 14 à Tigreville, je voudrais le 39...
                         
          Retour sur Lucien qui lit le papier au téléphone.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT

                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Ben oui, en Espagne. Un préavis pour mademoiselle Claire
           Prévost.
                         
           VOIX DE L'OPÉRATRICE (voix off dans le téléphone)
           Quelques minutes d'attente.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Hé ! Allo ! Avec I.D.
                         
           VOIX DE L'OPÉRATRICE (voix off dans le téléphone)
           D'accord.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Oui, merci.
                         
          Il raccroche. Il replie le papier et le rend à Gabriel.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Ils rappellent, y a quelques minutes d'attente.
                         
          Gabriel remet le papier dans sa poche.
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           En attendant, qu'est-ce que je vous offre ?
                         
          Lucien, qui se préparait à retourner vers la table, où sa femme
          continue à diner seule, s'accoude au comptoir.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Oh, un petit Calva.
                         
          Gabriel fait signe à Simone derrière le comptoir.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Un Calva pour monsieur.
                         
          Il reprend les deux bouteilles, une dans chaque main, et commence
          à verser le Picon, puis la bière, dans son verre.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Pour moi, même jeu, la même couleur !
                         
          Simone dépose un verre vide devant Lucien. Puis elle prend une
          bouteille de Calva sous le comptoir, la débouche et verse l'alcool
          dans le verre.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Dites donc, ils ont l'air de se coucher de bonne heure en
           face.
                         
          Lucien se redresse avec un large sourire.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Ahhh ! Parce que vous êtes descendu chez Quentin ! Ben vous
           avez pas fini de rigoler.
                         
          Simone rebouche la bouteille et la repose sous le comptoir.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Avec lui, si vous avez pas soif, vous serez tout de suite
           servi. Je sais même pas s'il sert encore du vin à table.
           Hum ! Sacré Albert !
                         
          Il se tourne vers la salle.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Ah, on peut dire qu'il a sauté la barrière, celui-là.
                         
          Il revient vers Gabriel.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Parce que, hein, pardon... Joyeux compagnon, mesdames ! Pas
           snob sur le biberon, c'est moi qui vous le dis. Allez,
           venez...
                         
          Il prend son verre et fait signe à Gabriel de le suivre en salle.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           On a bien rigolé, il y a quinze ans, tous les deux. Tandem
           terrible, connu sur la région.
          Il fait quelques pas, suivi de Gabriel, qui a aussi pris son
          verre, puis il s'arrête de marcher.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Parce que vous en fûtes ?
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Comme vous dites. Et pas manchot. Et puis un jour, crac,
           fini, plus un verre, l'abstinence, le gâtisme. C'est de ce
           jour-là qu'il a changé.
                         
          Il reprend sa marche.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           On dirait qu'il y a plus que le mauvais qui ressort.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Qu'est-ce que vous appelez le mauvais ?
                         
          Lucien s'assoit sur la banquette d'une table à côté des
          « marins ». Gabriel s'assoit en face de lui.
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Côté renfermé, cette espèce de prétention, pas faire comme
           tout le monde... Un genre, quoi !
                         
          Un vieux « marin », en blouson de cuir, assis juste à côté de
          Lucien, qui a des cartes dans une main et une cigarette dans
          l'autre, se tourne vers Lucien.
                         
           LE « MARIN » EN BLOUSON DE CUIR
           Mais il l'a toujours eu, le genre. L'a-t-y pas été faire
           son service militaire en Chine ? Je vous demande un peu.
                         
          A côté de lui, sur la banquette, un homme portant un béret, une
          pipe au bec, se mêle à la conversation.
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           C'est comme la prétention qu'il a toujours eu dans ses
           lectures. Vous croyez peut-être qu'il lit le journal comme
           tout le monde ? Ah ! Pensez-vous ! Des bouquins plein une
           malle. Tu te rappelles les soirs où il nous emmerdait
           avec... et comment qu'il l'appelait, celui-là ?... Un gros
           qu'avait un nom d'eau gazeuse... A... Ap...
           Appolinarès ?... Apolina...
                         
           LE « MARIN » AU BLOUSON DE CUIR
           Appolinaris !...
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Ah !...
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Ah, je dis pas qu'il a pas toujours été fou. Mais avant, il
           communiquait. C'est depuis qu'il a arrêté de boire qu'il a
           muté sournois. Il est plus rien. Allez donc voir ce qui se
           passe là-dedans.
                         
          Il se tapote le front. Un autre client, assis à la table voisine,
          s'assoit sur la banquette à côté de l'homme au béret.
           LE CLIENT DE LA TABLE VOISINE
           Et d'après Billoux, qu'a servi chez lui, paraît qu'il avait
           des sortes d'éblouissements... de malaises.
                         
          Lucien se lève.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Je ne dis pas non. Car il aurait comme un cancer ou une
           cirrhose du foie que je serais le premier à lui tirer mon
           chapeau, mais alors qu'il le dise, Bon Dieu, c'est tout ce
           qu'on lui demande.
                         
          Le téléphone sonne. Lucien contourne la table.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Tiens, ça doit être Madrid.
                         
          Il se dirige vers le comptoir.
                         
          Arrivé au comptoir, il décroche le téléphone. Derrière lui, on
          voit Gabriel, qui est resté sans bouger à sa place, et qui
          continue à boire.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT

           Oui.

                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Ne quittez pas.
                         
          Il se tourne vers Gabriel.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           C'est Madrid.
                         
          Il pose le combiné sur le comptoir. Gabriel, son verre à la main,
          se lève lentement et se dirige vers le comptoir. Lucien retourne
          s'assoir sur la banquette. Gabriel arrive au comptoir sur lequel
          il pose son verre. Il prend le combiné et le porte à son oreille.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Allo ! La résidence Mora ?...
                         
          Derrière lui, Lucien et les « marins » sont tous tournés vers lui,
          et ne perdent pas une miette de la conversation.

           Mademoiselle Claire Prévost.

          Un long silence.
                         
           CLAIRE (voix off dans le téléphone)
           Allo ?... Allo ?... Mais enfin, qui appelle ?... Allo ?...
           Mais répondez ! Qui est à l'appareil ?
                         
          Gabriel raccroche lentement sans répondre. Puis il reprend son
          verre sur le comptoir, se dirige vers les deux bouteilles, remplit
          son verre, d'abord de Picon, puis de bière, repose les bouteilles,
          porte le verre à ses lèvres, et le boit lentement.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - RUE HÔTEL STELLA - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Même plan rapproché sur la fenêtre de la chambre d'Albert que
          celui vu juste avant que Gabriel entre dans le café.
                         
          Albert est maintenant seul à scruter la rue derrière les rideaux.
          Il laisse retomber le rideau et s'éloigne de la fenêtre.
          HOTEL STELLA - CHAMBRE ALBERT - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Albert s'éloigne de la fenêtre dont il vient de laisser retomber
          le rideau. Il se rapproche du miroir au-dessus de la cheminée,
          miroir dans lequel on voit le lit, dans lequel Suzanne est
          couchée. Il ouvre une boîte à bonbons posée sur la cheminée.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Qu'est-ce qu'il peut bien faire là-bas ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Chercher ce qu'on ne trouve plus chez nous.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Tu regrettes ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Pourquoi veux-tu que je regrettes ? J'ai mes bonbons, moi.
                         
          Il met un bonbon dans sa bouche. Il se rapproche lentement d'un
          cadre accroché au mur à droite de la cheminée. Ce cadre montre une
          photo d'Albert en uniforme colonial, posant devant un fleuve sur
          lequel navigue une jonque. A droite de ce cadre, un autre cadre
          montre une autre photo d'Albert devant le bastingage d'un bateau.
          Derrière lui, sur le fleuve, navigue aussi une jonque. Albert
          regarde longuement les photos, en croquant son bonbon.
                         
          A moitié assise dans son lit, Suzanne l'observe.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Albert...
                         
          Albert regarde toujours les photos au mur.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Hmmm !...
          Il se retourne.
                         
          Suzanne le regarde avec un pointe d'inquiétude dans les yeux.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Allez, viens te coucher, va.
                         
          Mâchouillant toujours son bonbon, Albert s'éloigne des photos. La
          caméra reste un temps en plan fixe sur les photos, puis la lumière
          s'éteint dans la pièce.
                         
          CAFÉ NORMAND - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Simone s'éloigne du comptoir avec un plateau chargé de verres de
          vin. On entend beaucoup de brouhaha dans la salle. Simone passe
          devant Madame Esnault, assise seule à la même table que
          précédemment. La nappe a été enlevée, et une tasse de café est
          posée devant la patronne. Il n'y a plus de joueurs autour du
          billard, mais Joséphine est toujours assise seule à sa table à
          côté du billard, donc légèrement surélevée par rapport à la salle.
          Simone s'approche de la table des marins, qui sont tous pliés en
          deux de rire. Seul Gabriel, en premier plan, ne semble pas
          partager l'hilarité générale. Il verse le fond de la bouteille de
          Picon dans son verre. En face de lui, Lucien rigole avec ses
          clients. Simone pose son plateau en bout de table.
                         
                          JOSÉPHINE
           Moi, Hitler, tout ce que j'avais à lui reprocher, c'est ses
           moustaches.
                         
          Au son de sa voix, il est évident que Joséphine a un peu trop bu.
          Les rires, qui s'étaient interrompus pour la laisser parler,
          reprennent de plus belle. Simone pose chaque verre devant son
          destinataire. Au premier plan, Gabriel se lève lourdement, la
          bouteille à la main. Il lève la bouteille en l'air.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Une autre bouteille !
                         
          Simone s'approche de Gabriel, mais personne d'autre ne semble
          s'intéresser à lui.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Joséphine, raconte un peu à monsieur ce que tu faisais sous
           l'occupation.
                         
          Simone prend la bouteille de la main de Gabriel et s'éloigne vers
          le bar. Gabriel reste debout.
                         
          Plan moyen de Joséphine, le verre à la main.
                         
                          JOSÉPHINE
           J'écrivais à la Kommandantur, et je dénonçais tous les
           malfaisants.
                         
          Éclats de rire en voix off.
                         
                          JOSÉPHINE
           Tiens, toi, je t'ai dénoncé plus de dix fois pour marché
           noir. Mais ils ont jamais voulu me croire.
          Contrechamp avec la caméra placé dans le dos de Joséphine, et
          montrant la table des « marins » en contrebas. Gabriel est
          toujours debout. Le client, qui était auparavant installé à la
          table voisine, se tourne vers Gabiel.
                         
           LE CLIENT DE LA TABLE VOISINE
           Quand on vous disait que c'était un phénomène !
                         
          Simone apporte une nouvelle bouteille de Picon à Gabriel, qui se
          rassoit. Le « marin » au blouson de cuir lève son verre vers
          Gabriel.
                         
           LE « MARIN » AU BLOUSON DE CUIR
           Et bien, m'sieur, à votre santé !
                         
          Plan moyen sur Gabriel qui verse de la bière dans son verre. On
          entend des clients qui lui parlent en voix off, mais il est
          difficile de savoir qui parle exactement.
                         
           UN CLIENT (voix off)
           Voilà une tournée qui vous portera bonheur !
           UN AUTRE CLIENT (voix off)
           La première fois que vous venez à Tigreville, ben ce sera
           pas la dernière ! On a vingt milles parisiens tous les
           étés, ben y en avait même depuis avant la guerre.
                         
          Gabriel boit son verre par gorgées, le regard un peu vague.
                         
           UN AUTRE CLIENT (voix off)
           Ah oui, c'est vrai.
                         
          Le début de la réplique d'un autre client est rendue
          incompréhensible par le brouhaha ambiant.
                         
           UN AUTRE CLIENT (voix off)
           Question iode, on craint personne, même pas Berck.
                         
          Plan sur la table des « marins ». Le vieux « marin » au blouson de
          cuir pointe son doigt vers Gabriel.
                         
           LE « MARIN » AU BLOUSON DE CUIR
           Dans un journal, on nous appelle la Californie Normande.
                         
          Tous les autres « marins » approuvent. Le marin au blouson de cuir
          lève son verre.
                         
           LE « MARIN » AU BLOUSON DE CUIR
           Messieurs !... A Tigreville !...
                         
          Tous lèvent leurs verres, y compris Lucien, en disant : « A
          Tigreville !» Gabriel se lève, le verre à la main, et dit, d'une
          voix un peu pâteuse :
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Messieurs... Votre accueil me bouleverse, mais ne saurait
           égarer mon jugement. J'ai tout de même pas mal voyagé, ce
           qui me permet de vous dire, en connaissance de cause, que
           votre patelin est tarte comme il est pas permis et qu'il y
           fait un temps de merde !
                         
          Il se penche sur la table pour parler plus près des visages des
          « marins », qui éberlués par l'impertinence de Gabriel, reposent
          lentement leurs verres sur la table.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Je suppose que monsieur plaisante...
                         
          Gabriel se tourne vers lui.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Absolument pas.
                         
          Le marin au blouson de cuir se lève pour faire face à Gabriel
                         
           LE « MARIN » AU BLOUSON DE CUIR
           Vous savez combien y a eu de jours de soleil en
           Juillet ?... Dix-sept !
                         
          Gabriel rapproche son visage du sien.
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Soleil de mes fesses ! Vous savez pas ce que c'est que le
           soleil ! Vous l'avez jamais vu, vous !
                         
          D'une bourrade, il repousse le marin, qui retombe sur ses amis sur
          la banquette. Puis il monte sur « l'estrade » du billard. Arrivé
          en haut des trois marches, il commence à danser le flamenco en
          tapant du pied par terre, à la manière des danseurs espagnols.
          Tous les clients du café le regarde, un peu subjugués par cette
          démonstration inhabituelle d'ivresse.
                         
          Plusieurs gros plans sur les pieds de Gabriel en train de danser.
                         
          (NOTE - Lors des gros plans de pieds, ce n'est pas l'acteur Jean-
          Paul Belmondo qui danse, mais il est doublé par un véritable
          danseur de flamenco. C'est aussi la raison pour laquelle, sur la
          plupart des autres plans, on ne voit que le haut du corps de
          Gabriel, à partir de la taille.)
                         
          Gabriel saute de l'estrade sur la table de la patronne, qui ôte
          prestement sa tasse de café, se lève et s'éloigne de la table.
          Gabriel continue à danser sur la table.
                         
          A la fin de la démonstration de Flamenco, Gabriel saute à terre.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           C'est ça, le soleil !
                         
          Il s'avance, en titubant un peu, vers la table. D'un geste rapide
          du bras, il balaie tous les verres posés sur la table.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Ahhhh !... Mais je veux pas voir de verres vides.
                         
          Lucien se lève, et alpague Gabriel, aidé par l'un des « marins ».
          Gabriel repousse Lucien. Tous les clients du bar se sont levés, et
          se sont regroupés autour de Gabriel. Derrière lui, un homme le
          pousse. Gabriel se retourne, près à se battre. Puis il se retourne
          de nouveau vers Lucien, que sa femme retient par le bras. Il prend
          une liasse de billets dans sa poche et les lance en l'air.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Quieto !
                         
                          UN MARIN
           Il est peut-être armé !...
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Le monsieur paie !... Les gens de ma suite vont venir... ce
           sont des gitans... traitez-les comme moi-même.
                         
          Lucien l'attrape par le col de sa veste.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           A coups de pompe dans le train que je vais vous traiter !
                         
          Gabriel le repousse avec force, repoussant aussi, en même temps,
          tous les clients groupés derrière lui.
                         
          Il se plante devant la porte d'entrée.
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Arrière, les esquimaux ! Je rentre seul... le matador
           rentre toujours seul. Plus il est grand, plus il est seul.
           Je vous laisse à vos banquises, à vos igloos, à vos
           pingouins. ¡
                         
          Il se tourne vers madame Esnault.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Por favor Señora ! À quelle heure le train pour Madrid ?
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Dans cinq minutes ! Si tu te dépêches pas, tu le loupes !
                         
          Gabriel le regarde posément, se retourne lentement et ouvre la
          porte. Lucien le pousse violemment dehors.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Allez, ouste, avant que je me fâche !
                         
          TIGREVILLE - RUE HÔTEL STELLA - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Poussé par Lucien, Gabriel sort du café en titubant. Il manque
          s'étaler par terre, mais se redresse. La porte du café s'est
          refermée. Gabriel se dirige vers l'hôtel en zigzaguant. Il manque
          de nouveau s'étaler par terre, mais s'appuie sur le mur en face de
          l'hôtel. Il attends un instant, puis reprend sa progression
          hésitante vers l'hôtel. Finalement, il s'étale à plat ventre par
          terre.
                         
          CAFÉ NORMAND - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Dans le café, tous les clients sont toujours debout. Lucien
          observe Gabriel en écartant le rideau de la vitrine. Il se tourne
          vers le client au béret.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Va l'aider à traverser la rue, il y arrivera jamais tout
           seul.
                         
          L'homme au béret ouvre la porte et sort en refermant la porte
          derrière lui.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Le Picon-bière, ça pardonne pas. C'est de ça que mon pauvre
           papa est mort ! Y a rien de plus traître !
                         
          Il reprend son observation derrière le rideau de la vitrine.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - RUE HÔTEL STELLA - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          L'homme au béret trotte vers Gabriel, toujours couché par terre au
          milieu de la rue. Il l'aide à se relever.
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Allons !...
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           J'ai buté contre un piège à phoques !
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Ah oui, mais c'est rien que ça ! Allez !...
                         
          Gabriel passe le bras autour des épaules de l'homme, qui l'aide à
          marcher vers l'hôtel.
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Appuie-toi sur mon épaule.
                         
          Gabriel le regarde en souriant et le pointe du doigt.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           T'as une bonne tête, toi !
                         
          Il lève les yeux vers l'hôtel.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           C'est la gare ?
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Oui.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Tu veux un billet de quai ?
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Non, c'est pas la peine.
                         
          Gabriel se dégage de son étreinte, et se dirige vers la porte de
          l'hôtel.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Allez, Ciao !
                         
          L'homme au béret agite la main.
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Bon voyage !
                         
          On entend, en bruit off, la porte de l'hôtel qui se referme
          lourdement.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - CHAMBRE ALBERT - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Suzanne et Albert dorment dans leur lit. On entend des bruits de
          pas mal assurés. Suzanne se redresse brusquement sur le lit.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           C'est lui, c'est lui qui rentre.
                         
          Albert ne bouge pas.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Hmm !...
                         
          Les bruits de pas hésitants continuent. Puis un bruit de chute
          prolongée, comme quelqu'un qui dévale un escalier. Suzanne se
          tourne vers Albert.
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Tu vois ce que je te disais.
                         
          Albert bouge lentement dans le lit.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh, merde !
                         
          Il s'extirpe lentement de sous ses draps, s'assoit sur le rebord
          du lit, allume sa lampe de chevet, puis se lève. Suzanne le
          regarde traverser la chambre. On entend le bruit de la porte qui
          s'ouvre, puis qui se ferme en claquant.

          Plan en contre-plongée d'Albert, en pyjama, arrivant sur le palier
          de l'étage. Il regarde dans la pénombre en contrebas, puis il
          allume la lumière pour mieux voir.
                         
          Plan en plongée de Gabriel étalé sur le dos au pied de l'escalier.
          Il se redresse légèrement et ricane bêtement.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Salut, papa !
                         
          Par signe, il explique sa chute, tout en continuant à ricaner.
          Albert descend l'escalier.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - VESTIBULE DE RÉCEPTION - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Gabriel s'accroche des deux mains à la rampe pour essayer de se
          relever, mais n'y arrive pas. Albert arrive à sa hauteur.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et ben, qu'est-ce qui vous arrive ?
                         
          Il l'aide à se relever.
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           J'ai voulu descendre du train en marche.
                         
          Il est enfin debout.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh, ben oui, ça doit être ça !... Allez, tenez-vous bien.
                         
          Il le soutient pour l'aider à monter l'escalier. Gabriel fait
          trois pas, puis rate une marche.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Attention !... Allez...

          Plan en légère plongée, montrant Albert et Gabriel gravissant les
          dernières marches de l'escalier.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Ah, mon vieux papa !... Heureusement que je t'ai, hein ?
          Il viennent d'atteindre le palier.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Ça t'ennuie pas que je t'appelle papa ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ben non, ça m'ennuie pas.
                         
          Il le guide le long du couloir.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           On va aller boire un petit verre, tous les deux, sans rien
           dire à personne.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Merci, mais moi, je ne bois pas.
                         
          Ils viennent de dépasser la chambre d'Albert. La porte s'ouvre et
          Suzanne apparaît, en chemise de nuit. Gabriel se retourne.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Oh ben, la señora, là, elle a peut-être envie d'aller
           porter un toast à...
                         
          Albert le tient à bout de bras plaqué contre le mur.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           La señora, elle a surtout envie de roupiller. Allez...
                         
          Il le laisse appuyé contre le mur, pendant qu'il ouvre la porte de
          sa chambre. Gabriel fait un petit signe de la main et un sourire
          niais à Suzanne, qui rentre précipitamment dans sa chambre.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - CHAMBRE GABRIEL - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Albert allume la lumière dans la chambre, puis traverse le
          couloir, pour récupérer Gabriel, toujours appuyé contre le mur.
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Allez...
                         
          Soutenu par Albert, Gabriel entre dans sa chambre.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Viens, je t'emmène au Prado... Tu connais le Prado ?...
                         
          Albert le guide vers son lit.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Un jardin avec un musée dessus. Oh, ben, c'est pas des
           trucs à me faire relever la nuit, ça.
                         
          Il appuie Gabriel contre la rambarde au pied du lit, puis se
          dirige vers la tête du lit, pour rabattre le couvre-lit.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Claire et moi, on y allait tout le temps. On prenait deux
           Prado, et on avait des rêves pour cent ans.
                         
          Il se tourne vers Albert, qui finit de rabattre le couvre-lit.
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Et Claire... Tu vas me dire que tu la connais aussi, peut-
           être ?...
                         
          Albert le prend par le torse et le guide vers le lit.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           C'est votre amie ?
                         
          Gabriel hoche la tête.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Ouais, c'est mon amie... une amie qui s'est tirée !...
           C'est pas gentil, ça !
                         
          Albert vient de réussir à l'assoir sur le lit.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Allez !...
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Pas beau ! Alors, tu vois, tu pas refuser de boire avec un
           type qu'a plus d'amie.
                         
          Albert le couche sur le lit.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mais je vous ai déjà dit que je ne buvais pas. Allez...
           Là...
                         
          Il se relève et se dirige vers la porte.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Maintenant, je vais éteindre, et vous allez dormir, hein ?
                         
          Gabriel se redresse brusquement sur son lit.
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Non !
                         
          Il tend la main vers Albert.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           J'ai une meilleure idée. Je vais faire monter deux Xérès.
                         
          Il se recouche et appuie sur la sonnette du service en chambre.

          Plan en plongée du palier du premier étage, vu du plafond au-
          dessus de l'escalier. Une porte s'ouvre et une jeune femme en
          chemise de nuit vient s'accouder à la rambarde. Il s'agit de
          Marie-Jo, l'employée résidente de l'hôtel.
                         
                          MARIE-JO
           Ben, qu'est-ce qu'y a ? Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
                         
          Elle lève les yeux vers le plafond.
                         
          Plan moyen du couloir. Albert sort de la chambre de Gabriel et
          fait un pas hors de la chambre.
                         
           MARIE-JO (voix off)
           Qui est-ce qui a sonné ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Personne... Retournez vous coucher, Marie-Jo.

          Albert rentre dans la chambre et referme la porte. Gabriel le
          rejoint près de la porte.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je vais inviter la patronne à prendre un verre.
                         
          Albert le repousse vers l'intérieur de la chambre.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Elle dort, la patronne. Tout le monde dort. Allez...
                         
          Il le prend par le bras et le guide vers son lit.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Les manières se perdent. On s'est jamais couché si tôt à
           Madrid.
                         
          Arrivé devant l'armoire à glace, il se retourne vers Albert.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           J'espère qu'elle me fera tout de même la grâce d'assister à
           mes débuts aux Arènes Monumentales.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Je lui ferai part de votre aimable invitation.
                         
          Gabriel se tourne vers la glace et regarde son reflet.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Y aura du monde... Luis Miguel attire toujours la foule...
           Y a longtemps que je rêve de triompher à Madrid... Le
           public sera exigeant... surtout derrière Miguelito.
                         
          Il se tourne vers Albert, qui le regarde avec une tendresse mêlée
          de nostalgie.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je vais être obligé de prendre des risques.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et bien, j'espère que tout se passera bien.
          Gabriel marche vers le milieu de la chambre. Il parle avec de
          grands gestes et une voix passionnée.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je mettrai mon costume blanc... celui de mes débuts. Vous
           vous souvenez de cette Novillada de Tolède ? Ce vent froid,
           ce public affreux... et ce taureau qui voulait pas mourir.
           Mais depuis, j'en ai estoqué plus de cent... Je suis le
           plus grand matador français... Gabriel Fouquet, plus grand
           que Pierre Schul... Yo soy unico !
                         
          D'un geste vif, il ramasse la nappe sur la table, et commence à
          tournoyer dans la chambre, se servant de la nappe comme de la cape
          d'un matador, faisant des passes à un taureau imaginaire. Il
          prononce les paroles rituelles des matador en espagnol. Albert
          s'assoit sur une chaise pour le regarder. A la fin de sa courte
          prestation, Gabriel se tourne vers Albert, gardant la nappe à la
          main dans la position figée de la cape du matador.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Ça vous intéresse, papa ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Peut-être...
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Qu'est-ce qui vous intéresse ?... Le matador, le taureau,
           où l'Espagne.
                         
          Plan rapproché sur la nappe, qui tourne, découvrant Albert en plan
          moyen.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Le voyage... votre façon de voyager.
                         
          Gabriel pose la nappe et s'assoit sur le lit.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Ah ! Ça, c'est un secret.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh, la-la ! Le véhicule, je le connais, je l'ai déjà pris.
           Et c'était pas un train de banlieue, vous pouvez me croire.
           Monsieur Fouquet, moi aussi, il m'est arrivé de boire. Et
           ça m'envoyait un peu plus loin que l'Espagne. Le Yang-Tsé-
           Kiang, vous avez déjà entendu parler du Yang-Tsé-Kiang ? Ça
           tient de la place dans une chambre, moi, je vous le dis.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Sûr... Et alors ?... Deux Xérès ?...
                         
          Albert hoche négativement la tête.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Je ne bois plus. Je croque des bonbons.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Et ça vous mène loin ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           En Chine, toujours... mais plus la même. Maintenant, c'est
           une espèce de Chine d'antiquaire. Quant à descendre le
           Yang-Tsé-Kiang en une nuit, c'est hors de question.
           Pfft !... Un petit bout par-ci, un petit bout par-là... Et
           encore, pas tous les soirs.
                         
          Il sourit.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Les sucreries font bouchon.
                         
          Il se lève.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Allez... Bonsoir.
                         
          Il fait deux pas vers la porte.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Papa !
                         
          Albert se retourne vers le lit, sur lequel Gabriel est toujours
          assis.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oui ?...
                         
          Gabriel écarte les bras.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je crois que j'ai raté mon train pour Madrid !
                         
          Il retombe à plat ventre sur le lit. Albert le regarde.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Monsieur Fouquet, quand on a les rêves que vous avez dans
           la tête, on ne se tourmente pas pour un train raté.
          Il se rapproche du lit, et prend la rambarde du pied de lit à deux
          mains.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Savez-vous à qui vous me faites penser ? A un de ces singes
           égarés, comme on en rencontre en Orient au moment des
           premiers froids...
                         
          Il regarde Gabriel avec plus d'attention et s'aperçoit qu'il s'est
          endormi. Il se retourne et se dirige lentement vers la porte. Il
          éteint la lumière, ouvre la porte, sort de la chambre et referme
          la porte derrière lui.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - CHAMBRE ALBERT - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Albert entre dans la chambre et referme la porte derrière lui.
          Suzanne est assise dans le lit.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Alors, qu'est-ce qui lui est arrivé ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh, rien, il a bu un coup de trop, c'est tout.
                         
          Il s'assoit sur le bord du lit pour enlever ses pantoufles.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Vous avez parlé de quoi ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Offf !... De singes... De singes et de singerie...
                         
          Il se glisse sous les draps. Suzanne en fait autant.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Allez...
                         
          Il éteint sa lampe de chevet. Suzanne garde les yeux grand
          ouverts. Elle semble songeuse.
                         
          Fondu au noir.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - LE PORT - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Plan moyen de la voiture d'Albert, une DS break. Albert vient de
          se garer à côté d'un « cube » Citroën, et sort du véhicule. Il
          porte une épaisse parka à col de fourrure, style « canadienne ».
          Il marche le long du bassin du port et passe devant des bateaux de
          pêches amarrés à quai.
                         
          Plan d'ensemble de la partie du port, où les pêcheurs débarquent
          leur poisson. Albert enjambe une amarre, et continue son chemin,
          passant devant un pêcheur vendant son poisson à la criée.
                         
          Plan moyen sur des cageots de poissons. Deux femmes sont en train
          de les trier, les répartissant dans les cageots.
                         
                          LE MARIN
           Hé !... T'as vu mes dorades ?...
          Albert serre distraitement la main du marin et continue à circuler
          entre les étals de poissons. Chaque marin-pêcheur a disposé sa
          pêche sur une planche posée sur deux tréteaux, tout le long du
          quai. Albert s'approche d'un autre étal et serre la main du marin.
          Apparemment, concentré sur les cageots de poisson, il n'a pas vu
          Lucien, debout, les mains dans les poches, à l'extrémité de l'étal
                         
                          LE MARIN
           Salut.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Combien, ces rougets ?...
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Ils sont bien, mais ils sont retenus. Toi aussi, je te
           retiens. Je te remercie pour la soirée d'hier.
                         
          Le marin suit la conversation en regardant alternativement Lucien
          et Albert.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Quelle soirée ?
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Oh, fais pas celui qui comprend pas. Ton client, là, ton
           Espagnol. Douze verres cassés, ça te dit rien ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Dis donc, toi. Primo, ça fait quinze ans que je t'interdis
           de me parler. Deuxio, si tu voulais pas qu'il boive,
           t'avais qu'à pas le servir.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Alors, là, monsieur Quentin, je te rétorque que primo, je
           l'ai viré. Deuxio, des ivrognes, il y en a assez dans le
           pays, sans que tu les fasses venir de Paris !
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Un ivrogne ?
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Oh ben un peu, oui ! Même que le père Bardasse, qui boit
           quinze Pastis par jour, il en revenait pas.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ahh ! Parce que tu mélanges tout ça, toi, mon Espagnol,
           comme tu dis, et le père Bardasse, les Grands-Ducs et les
           boit-sans-soif !
                         
          Il se rapproche de Lucien.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Les Grands-Ducs ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oui, monsieur, les princes de la cuite, les seigneurs, ceux
           avec qui tu buvais le coup dans le temps et qui ont
           toujours fait verre à part. Dis-toi bien que tes clients et
           toi, ils vous laissent à vos putasseries, les seigneurs.
           Ils sont à cent milles verres de vous. Eux, ils tutoient
           les anges !
                         
          Il s'éloigne de Lucien.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Excuse-moi, mais, nous autres, on est encore capable de
           tenir le litre sans se prendre pour Dieu le Père.
                         
          Albert se retourne.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mais... c'est bien ce que je vous reproche. Vous avez le
           vin petit et la cuite mesquine. Dans le fond, vous méritez
           pas de boire. Tu te demandes pourquoi il picole,
           l'Espagnol ? C'est pour essayer d'oublier les pignoufs
           comme vous !
                         
          Il se tourne vers le marin, toujours debout et stoïque derrière
          son étal.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Combien qu'il fait, ton lot de rougets, là ?
          Plan rapproché sur trois cageots plein de rougets, posés sur de la
          glace pilée sur l'étal du marin.
                         
           LE MARIN (voix off)
           Trois cents francs le kilo.
                         
          Plan d'ensemble sur l'étal du marin (vu de dos) avec le port
          derrière Albert.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Je te préviens : j'en ai retenu la moitié.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et bien, moi, je prends le tout. Allez, emballe-le moi, je
           vais venir le prendre.
                         
          Il s'éloigne lentement.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Décidément, on peut plus causer de rien, avec toi, tiens.
                         
          Albert, avant de quitter l'étal, se retourne une dernière fois
          vers Lucien.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           T'es trop con !
                         
          Albert s'éloigne lentement, les mains dans les poches. Lucien
          s'éloigne aussi, dans la même direction qu'Albert, mais à
          distance.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - CUISINE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Plan rapproché sur le tableau d'appel des chambres. Le voyant n° 8
          s'allume et sonne. En-dessous du tableau, un plan de travail, sur
          lequel un plateau de petit-déjeuner est posé. Marie-Jo apporte une
          grosse cafetière en métal, qu'elle pose sur le plateau. Elle prend
          le plateau et sort de la cuisine vers la salle à manger.
                         
          La caméra reste dans la cuisine et suit Marie-Jo qui traverse la
          salle à manger vers le vestibule. Assise à une table, Suzanne est
          occupée à gérer la paperasserie de l'hôtel. Elle tourne légèrement
          la tête vers Marie-Jo.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Ah, tout de même !
                         
          Marie-Jo ne s'arrête pas et continue son chemin vers la porte
          ouverte du vestibule de réception. A travers les vitres de la
          salle à manger, on la voit monter l'escalier.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - CHAMBRE GABRIEL - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          La porte s'ouvre et Marie-Jo entre, tenant son plateau à deux
          mains. Elle se dirige vers le lit, sur lequel Gabriel est affalé,
          tout habillé. Il a même encore ses chaussures ! Il a juste rabattu
          le couvre lit en partie sur lui, et surtout sur sa tête. Marie-Jo
          s'arrête devant le lit.
                          MARIE-JO
           Monsieur ?
                         
          Gabriel se retourne lentement, découvrant son visage, encore
          bouffi de sommeil... Il regarde le plateau d'un air un peu
          dégoûté.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Ohhh non ! Pas ça ! Montez-moi un Vichy.
                         
          Marie-Jo se retourne et se dirige vers la porte.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Hé !...
                         
          Marie-Jo s'arrête et se retourne. Gabriel s'assoit sur le lit, les
          jambes pendantes par-dessus la rambarde au pied du lit.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Qu'est-ce qu'on raconte dans la maison ?
                         
                          MARIE-JO
           A propos de quoi ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Hier soir.
                         
                          MARIE-JO
           Oh, Monsieur Quentin, y parle jamais de ces choses-là,
           hein. Pour lui, hier, c'est hier.
                         
          Gabriel regarde Marie-Jo, les bras croisés.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET

           le bon sens. Bon, je descends.
                         
          Il descend lentement du lit. Marie-Jo sort de la chambre et
          referme la porte derrière elle.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - VESTIBULE DE RÉCEPTION - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          La porte d'entrée est ouverte, et on aperçoit la voiture d'Albert,
          garée devant l'hôtel. Albert entre portant un cageot de rougets.
          Il longe l'escalier, et entre par l'autre porte de la salle à
          manger, située derrière l'escalier. Dans la pièce, on aperçoit
          Suzanne, les mains sur les hanches, qui regarde les quatre cageots
          de rougets déjà empilés par terre ! Derrière Suzanne, les portes
          des chambres froides.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Mais t'es complètement fou. Qu'est-ce qu'on va faire de
           tout ça ?
                         
          Albert pose le dernier cageot sur la table. Sur la droite du
          champ, on aperçoit Gabriel qui descend l'escalier.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           J'en sais rien, mais je veux pas me laisser emmerder par
           Monsieur Esnault.
          Il ouvre la porte d'une chambre froide, au moment où Gabriel
          s'encadre dans la porte ouvert de l'office.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et l'autre, il est descendu ?
                         
          Il se retourne et voit Gabriel.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - SALLE À MANGER - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Albert est debout devant la porte ouverte de la chambre froide,
          dans laquelle, posés sur des étagères, on aperçoit des bouteilles,
          du lait, des yaourts.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Vous avez besoin de quelque chose, Monsieur Fouquet ?
                         
          Il ouvre une autre porte de la chambre froide.
                         
          La caméra est maintenant placée dans la chambre froide. On voit
          Albert par la porte qui vient de s'ouvrir, et Gabriel par la porte
          déjà ouverte. Gabriel s'approche d'Albert.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je voulais vous demander pour hier soir...
                         
          Albert fait de la place dans la chambre froide pour y déposer ses
          poissons. Il enlève des plats vides.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Me demander quoi ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           J'ai pas fait trop de foin ?
                         
          Albert pose les plats vides sur la table
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Non, pas trop.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Tant mieux. On a beaucoup bavardé. J'ai pourtant pas la
           mémoire des noms, mais y en a un qui m'est resté gravé
           là...
                         
          Il désigne sa tempe.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           ... le Yang-Tsé-Kiang.
                         
          Albert ouvre une troisième porte, découvrant Suzanne, qui regarde
          Gabriel, le visage inquiet, puis se tourne vers Albert.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           J'ai toujours retenu les choses compliquées, comme
           anticonstitutionnellement... la dictée de Mérimée, les rois
           d'Égypte. J'y ajouterai le Yang-Tsé-Kiang.
                         
          Albert dépose un plat contenant des rougets sur une étagère de la
          chambre froide. Marie-Jo passe derrière eux, portant le plateau du
          petit-déjeuner de Gabriel. Suzanne regarde l'intérieur de la
          chambre froide sans la voir, les yeux dans le vague. Albert
          referme la troisième porte de la chambre froide, cachant Suzanne.
          Il pose un autre plat de rougets sur une étagère.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Monsieur Fouquet, je m'excuse, mais y a des heures pour
           bavarder et des heures pour travailler.
                         
          Il referme la porte, disparaissant à notre vue. Seule reste
          ouverte la porte derrière laquelle Gabriel est toujours debout,
          les mains dans les poches.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Oh, moi, les heures, vous savez... Le principal, c'est que
           je vous aie pas contrarié.
                         
          Albert referme la dernière porte.
                         
          Plan moyen sur Albert fermant la porte de la chambre froide, avec
          Suzanne derrière lui, qui l'observe, le regard inquiet.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ohhh ! Rassurez-vous. Pour me contrarier, faut se lever de
           bonne heure, ou se coucher beaucoup plus tard.
                         
          Il tire un cageot de rougets vers lui. Gabriel sourit, se retourne
          et sort de la salle à manger. Suzanne s'approche de la porte et le
          regarde traverser la réception.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - RUE HÔTEL STELLA - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Gabriel sort de l'hôtel, referme la porte, et se dirige vers le
          Café Normand. Il est déjà presque arrivé au café lorsque la porte
          de l'hôtel s'ouvre de nouveau. Suzanne, qui a déjà son écharpe
          autour du cou, sort en enfilant son manteau. Au loin, on voit
          Gabriel qui passe devant le café sans s'arrêter et continue dans
          la rue, disparaissant à nos yeux. Suzanne finit d'enfiler son
          manteau et court vers lui.
                         
          Contrechamp sur Suzanne, qui trottine en enfilant ses gants.
          Lorsqu'elle tourne le coin de la rue, elle se trouve nez à nez
          avec Gabriel qui achète des journaux. Il paie la marchande, qui
          rentre dans sa boutique, sourit et s'approche de Suzanne.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Alors, madame Quentin, on espionne l'aimable clientèle ?
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Monsieur Fouquet...
                         
          Il lui montre le journal qu'il tient à la main.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Les assassins, les voleurs, ils se nourrissent de journaux.
           L'homme traqué est obligé de se tenir au courant de tout.
           Depuis cette manie des portraits-robots, je suis obligé de
           changer de tête tous les jours. Je m'étais fait, je crois,
           hier, la tête de l'homme qui boit. Demain, de quoi sera-t-
           il fait ?...
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Je vois que vous aimez la plaisanterie.
                         
          Il s'éloigne d'elle, et continue sa promenade dans la rue qui
          descend vers la mer. Elle le suit.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Ça vous ennuie que nous fassions quelques pas ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je vous en prie.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Monsieur Fouquet, vous comptez rester longtemps chez nous ?
           Cette question vous surprend peut-être...
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Elle me surprend d'autant moins que votre mari me l'a déjà
           posée hier soir.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Et qu'est-ce que vous lui avez répondu ?
                         
          Gabriel sort une cigarette d'un paquet et la met dans sa bouche.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Que j'en savais rien.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Ah !... Remarquez, si vous devez rester que deux ou trois
           jours, je n'ai rien à vous dire, mais si vous comptez
           rester davantage...
                         
          Gabriel allume sa cigarette. Suzanne s'arrête de marcher, et
          Gabriel s'arrête aussi.
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Comment vous expliquer ?... Cette nuit, Albert vous a parlé
           du Yang-Tsé-Kiang. Et ben, il faut pas, c'est mauvais pour
           lui.
                         
          Elle se remet en marche, et Gabriel aussi.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - PLAGE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Il sont arrivé en bordure de mer. Le temps est très brumeux, et on
          distingue à peine la mer.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Vous devez me prendre pour une folle. Je voulais pas vous
           dire ça comme ça.
                         
          Gabriel saute sur un banc.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Monsieur Fouquet, nous sommes un ménage heureux, foutez-
           nous la paix.
          Du haut du banc, il se penche vers elle.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           C'est ça, la formule brutale ?
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Oui...
                         
          Gabriel descend du banc, et s'approche de la rambarde qui
          surplombe la plage. Suzanne le rejoint.
                         
          Plan rapproché de Gabriel appuyé des deux mains sur la rambarde.
          Suzanne s'accoude sur la rambarde, et regarde Gabriel, qui ne la
          regarde pas, mais regarde au loin vers la mer embrumée.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Je voudrais que vous compreniez. Albert est devenu parfait.
           J'ai peur que vous lui redonniez le goût des voyages. Il
           pourrait penser que vous allez en Chine sans lui.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           En Espagne, madame.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Pardon ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Moi, c'est l'Espagne.
                         
          Il se tourne vers elle.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Voyez, vous pouvez dormir tranquille.
                         
          Il s'éloigne de la rambarde. Suzanne reste songeuse et
                         BREDOUILLE :
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Évidemment, si c'est l'Espagne...
                         
          Gabriel descend, par un escalier, vers la plage, loin en
          contrebas. Suzanne se penche par-dessus la rambarde qui surplombe
          l'escalier.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Monsieur Fouquet, sans indiscrétion, vous êtes venu à
           Tigreville pourquoi ?
                         
          Gabriel s'arrête à mi-chemin dans l'escalier et relève la tête
          vers elle.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Pour vous reposer ? Pour vos affaires ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Pour achat, je cherche un magasin de confection. Vous
           connaissez ça ?
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Euh... Ça dépend... Pour homme ou pour femme ?
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Pour fillette.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Et ben, vous pourriez aller chez Landru. On l'appelle comme
           ça à cause de sa barbe et de ses deux femmes qui sont
           mortes.
                         
          Elle lui indique le chemin de la main.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Vous longez la plage, c'est dans la première rue qui monte.
           « Au Chic Parisien ».
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Merci.
                         
          Gabriel se retourne et reprend sa descente vers la plage.
                         
          Suzanne le regarde partir avec un air songeur. Elle met les mains
          dans ses poches et s'éloigne de la rambarde.
                         
          AU CHIC PARISIEN - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Gros plan sur le haut de la devanture du magasin. En grosses
          lettres, sur toute la longueur de la devanture, il est écrit « Au
          Chic Parisien ». En plus petit, à droite, il est écrit :
          « Frivolités », et à gauche : « Nouveautés ». Entre la vitrine et
          la porte d'entrée , est accrochée une enseigne publicitaire du
          « Journal de Mickey ». Un zoom arrière nous fait découvrir le
          reste de la devanture. Sur le côté droit de la vitrine, un panneau
          publicitaire des « Laines du Pingouin » voisine avec d'autres
          panneaux plus petits. En vitrine, un assortiment assez hétéroclite
          d'accessoires de plage, de vêtements et autres objets variés.
                         
          Panoramique vers la rue qui remonte de la mer. Gabriel y marche
          d'un pas décidé, venant vers le magasin.
          Il ouvre la porte, constellée de cartes postales, que l'on voit à
          travers la vitre. Sur la partie basse de la porte, où il n'y a pas
          de vitre, une gros panneau publicitaire de « Pierrot Gourmand ».
                         
          AU CHIC PARISIEN - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          L'intérieur du magasin a un aspect de « caverne d'Ali Baba », où
          les jouets voisinent avec les vêtements, les cartes postales, les
          ustensiles de cuisine, des roues de vélo, des masques de carnaval,
          un arrosoir...
                         
          Gabriel entre et referme la porte derrière lui. On entend des
          bruits, puis une voix qui dit :
                         
           LANDRU (voix off)
           Blanchette...
                         
          Gabriel fait deux pas dans la boutique.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Y a quelqu'un ?
          Dans un miroir, on voit le propriétaire des lieux qui s'approche,
          tenant un lapin blanc dans les bras.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Ma Blanchette, petite coquine ! Hein ? Tu t'es échappée !
                         
          « Landru » se dirige vers un grand clapier contenant d'autres
          lapins. Il est chauve avec une couronne de cheveux sur l'arrière
          du crâne, et une grande barbe qui le fait, en effet, ressembler
          vaguement au célèbre assassin de femmes.
                         
          A côté du clapier, deux grandes caisses, sur lesquelles sont
          inscrits, en lettres majuscules : « Matériel pour Feux
          d'Artifice » et « Danger Explosifs ». Et, à côté, une malle
          métallique, marqué « Fougasse Marrons ».
                         
                          LANDRU
           C'est pas gentil, ça, hein ! Allez, va retrouver tes petits
           amis.
                         
          Il va pour déposer le lapin dans le clapier, lorsqu'il entend
          Gabriel toussoter derrière lui. Il se retourne, avec le lapin
          blanc dans les bras.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Vous vouliez quelque chose, monsieur ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je voudrais un vêtement chaud, un pull-over, pour fillette.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Fillette ?...
                         
          Il ouvre le clapier, dépose le lapin à l'intérieur, referme le
          clapier et se tourne vers Gabriel.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Fillette ?... Il y a bien longtemps que je ne fais plus
           dans la fillette. Quel âge ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Dix ans.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Dix ans fort, ou dix ans faible ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Plutôt faible.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Vous ne dites pas ça pour me faire plaisir ?
                         
          Il déplace une échelle.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Parce que, là, j'ai peut-être votre affaire.
                         
          Il grimpe sur l'échelle.
          Gabriel lève les yeux, intrigué par ce que Landru est en train de
          dénicher dans ses réserves supérieures. Landru redescend portant
          un pull-over de taille enfant sur un cintre. Le pull-over, dont on
          ne peut déterminer la couleur (le film est en noir et blanc), est
          décoré d'alignements horizontaux de losanges de couleur sombre,
          sur un fond clair. Il peut s'ouvrir dans sa partie supérieure
          grâce à trois boutons, et il a un petit col de couleur sombre.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Cher monsieur, nous vous attendions depuis trente ans.
                         
          Landru s'est arrêté sur l'un des derniers barreaux de son échelle.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Qui ça, nous ?
                         
                          LANDRU
           Lui et moi.
                         
          Il descend les derniers barreaux.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Regardez-moi ça.
                         
          Il tend le pull à Gabriel, qui l'examine, pendant que Landru va
          ranger son échelle.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           J'ai peur quand même qu'il soit un peu grand.
                         
          Landru, qui a dépose son échelle contre un mur couvert d'étagères,
          se tourne vers lui.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Ah ! Ah ! J'étais sûr que vous croiriez ça. Tout le monde
           croit ça. Vous ne connaissez pas les laines du Queensland ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Non, mais je connais ma fille.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Écoutez-moi bien, monsieur. Non seulement, ce pull-over
           n'est pas trop grand, mais il ne peut pas l'être. Vous ne
           me demandez pas pourquoi ?.... Parce qu'il a été tricoté
           sur mesure pour une naine. Oui, naturellement, Puppy
           Schneider, ça ne vous dit rien ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Ma foi non.
                         
          Landru lui tapote l'épaule, et s'éloigne. Gabriel le suit des
          yeux.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Vous êtes trop jeune.
                         
          Il s'est approché d'un meuble sur lequel sont posés des masques.
          Sur le mur derrière le meuble, une série de photos de mode.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Puppy Schneider... Il n'y en avait que pour elle, dans les
           mondanités des années vingt.
                         
          Il prend l'un des masques sur le meuble, représentant une jeune
          femme coiffé d'un étrange chapeau.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Un millionnaire Américain...
                         
          Il retourne un autre masque, accroché sur un poteau vertical, et
          qui représente un homme avec une grand barbe blanche.
                         
                          LANDRU
           ... Walter Krutchen, l'avait vue dans un cirque et en était
           tombé fou. Les grands hommes ont toujours aimé les petites
           femmes, mais à ce point-là, avouez que c'est rare.
                         
          Gabriel l'écoute en souriant, assis sur l'une des caisses
          d'explosifs.
                         
          Landru repose le masque sur le meuble, et l'autre masque s'est
          retourné tout seul. Il désigne le pull du doigt.
                         
                          LANDRU
           C'est lui qui m'avait commandé ce pull-over, d'après une
           maquette de Van Dongen.
                         
          Il se rapproche de Gabriel.
                         
                          LANDRU
           La-dessus, le krach de Wall Street, en 29. Le Krutchen
           s'est suicidé, comme vous et moi. La Puppy est retournées à
           son cirque, et le pull-over m'est resté sur les bras.
                         
          Il ricane.
                         
                          LANDRU
           C'est pour vous dire que ce n'est pas l'acquisition
           banale... pas le vêtement de tout le monde.
                         
          Gabriel examine le pull de plus prêt.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Mais vous êtes sûr que Puppy Schneider ne l'a pas porté ?
                         
          Il tend la main, comme s'il prêtait serment.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Juré.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Vous avez beaucoup de choses comme ça, qui datent un peu ?
                         
          Landru regarde autour de lui avec des yeux un peu inquiétants.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Des choses insoupçonnables. Ainsi, devinez un peu sur quoi
           vous êtes assis.
                         
          Gabriel se lève d'un bond.
                          LANDRU
           N'ayez pas peur !
                         
          Un chat saute sur la caisse d'explosifs que Gabriel vient de
          quitter, puis disparaît derrière la caisse. Landru ricane.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Le malin !... Encore une commande Walter Krutchen pour
           l'anniversaire de Puppy.
                         
          Il prend le bras de Gabriel et l'entraîne vers le devant de la
          boutique.
                         
                          LANDRU
           De quoi illuminer toute une ville. Pschhh !... Cher
           monsieur, au plaisir.
                         
          Il passe derrière sa caisse et prend le pull des mains de Gabriel.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Et si un jour, vous avez besoin de quoi que ce soit, je dis
           bien de quoi que ce soit...
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je ne commettrai pas la folie de m'adresser ailleurs,
           soyez-en sûr.
                         
          Landru emballe le pull.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Vous ferez porter ma note à l'hôtel Stella.
                         
          Landru donne le paquet à Gabriel.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Ça ne presse pas.
          Gabriel se dirige vers la sortie de la boutique.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Cher monsieur, au plaisir.
                         
          Landru suit Gabriel avec un regard un peu inquiétant.
                         
          AU CHIC PARISIEN - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Gabriel sort du magasin avec son paquet à la main. Il fait trois
          pas dans la rue, mais se retourne car la porte du magasin vient de
          s'ouvrir de nouveau. Landru sort, son chapeau sur la tête, et
          ferme la porte à clef.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Vous fermez déjà ?
                         
                          LANDRU
           Vous m'avez bien dit de porter votre note ? Chose promise,
           chose due.
                         
          Il enlève son chapeau, et s'éloigne vers le centre ville. Gabriel
          sourit et s'éloigne lui aussi.
                         
          UN CHEMIN FORESTIER - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Gabriel marche sur un chemin carrossable, bordé de chaque côté par
          des arbres. Il a toujours ses journaux et le paquet de Landru à la
          main. Sur la droite de Gabriel, à travers la végétation, on
          distingue un grand mur de pierre. Gabriel arrive à un grand
          portail de fer forgé blanc, sur lequel est apposé un écriteau qui
          indique : « Cours Dillon - Externat Internat ». Il tire sur une
          corde qui actionne une cloche. Il regarde, à travers les barreaux
          du portail, un homme qui s'approche de lui en courant. Il s'agit
          de l'homme au béret, qui l'avait, la veille au soir, ramené à son
          hôtel. L'homme regarde Gabriel à travers les barreaux du portail.
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Gabriel !... Ah, ça par exemple ! Qu'est-ce que tu viens
           glander dans nos confins.
                         
          Il ouvre la porte. Gabriel entre et regarde l'homme avec surprise.

                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Nous nous connaissons ?
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Ben, ma parole, t'étais encore plus rond que je ne
           pensais ! Tu te rappelles pas ? C'est moi qui t'ai mis dans
           le train.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Cette nuit ?
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Oui...
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je vois... Bon, et bien, je voudrais pas abuser deux fois
           de votre obligeance.
                         
          Il met ses journaux sous son bras et tend le paquet à l'homme.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Soyez bien aimable de remettre ce paquet...
                         
          L'homme écarte les bras pour ne pas toucher au paquet.
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Ah non, je me ferais engueuler. Tiens, adresse-toi là-bas.
                         
          Il lui montre une imposante bâtisse du XVIII° siècle au bout de
          l'allée. Une femme vient vers eux. Gabriel et l'homme marchent à
          sa rencontre.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Pour les histoires de train, j'aimerais pouvoir compter sur
           la... enfin sur ta discrétion.
                         
          Il lui tend un billet, que l'autre ne prend pas.
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Ah non, mon cochon ! Crois pas t'en tirer comme ça...
                         
          Il baisse la voix, car la femme est presque arrivée près d'eux.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Tu paieras ta tournée ce soir.
                         
          Il s'éloigne. La femme, qui est l'infirmière de l'école en
          général, et l'infirmière personnelle de la directrice en
          particulier, et qui se prénomme Georgette, toise Gabriel. Elle
          porte un uniforme de nurse anglaise : grande cape noire et coiffe
          noire avec voile couvrant toute la chevelure, avec seulement une
          petite bordure blanche sur le front.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Monsieur, le personnel ne doit accepter aucun pourboire.
           Que puis-je pour vous ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Si vous voulez bien remettre ce paquet à la petite Marie
           Fouquet.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Voulez-vous me suivre au parloir.
                         
          Elle fait demi-tour pour retourner vers le bâtiment. Gabriel la
          suit.

          Hall de dimensions imposantes, avec un grand escalier de bois
          montant vers les étages. Un grand lustre en fer forgé pend au
          milieu du hall. Un groupe de petite filles, portant toutes la même
          blouse grise serrée à la taille, traverse le hall sous la conduite
          d'une maîtresse strictement habillée et au chignon impeccable.
          Elles montent l'escalier. Une grande porte vitrée, à l'extrémité
          du hall, s'ouvre, laissant entrer Georgette, suivie de Gabriel.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Entrez.
                         
          Elle referme la porte derrière Gabriel et traverse le hall, suivie
          par Gabriel.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Je crois que votre visite fera plaisir à tout le monde.
           Nous commencions à craindre que cette petite Fouquet soit
           complètement oubliée. Vous permettez ?
                         
          Elle s'arrête au milieu du hall, lui prend le paquet des mains, et
          reprend son chemin.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Nous vérifions tous les colis destinés aux pensionnaires.
           Vérification symbolique, bien sûr.
                         
          Elle monte l'escalier d'un pas rapide, puis s'arrête net au bout
          de cinq ou six marches. Elle se retourne et regarde Gabriel qui
          est resté debout au milieu du hall.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           C'est drôle, je vous voyais plus âgé. Marie a de la chance
           d'avoir un papa aussi jeune.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Oui, mais je ne suis pas son père. Je suis un cousin...
           cousin éloigné.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Ah !... Tant pis, je vais quand même la chercher. Si vous
           voulez bien attendre.
                         
          Elle fait deux pas dans l'escalier
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Non...
                         
          La femme s'arrête et se retourne de nouveau vers Gabriel.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je voudrais pas la déranger dans son travail.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Ça lui arrive si rarement.
                         
          Une voix, provenant d'une pièce donnant sur le hall, appelle :
                         
           MADAME VICTORIA (voix off)
           Georgette !
                         
          Georgette se retourne vers l'endroit d'où provient la voix.
                         
          Plan rapproché sur une double porte battante donnant sur le hall.
                         
           MADAME VICTORIA (voix off)
           What's happening ? I don't want to be disturbed. I am
           working.
           (Traduction : Que se passe-t-il ? Je ne veux pas être
           dérangée. Je travaille.)
                         
          Retour sur Georgette, toujours debout sur les marches de
          l'escalier, le paquet de Gabriel à la main. Elle se penche vers le
          hall.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Nothing at all, madam !
           (Traduction : Rien du tout, madame.)
                         
          Elle chuchote en direction de Gabriel.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           C'est madame la directrice.
                         
          Gabriel, toujours debout au milieu du hall, la regarde et
          chuchote, lui aussi :
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je ne savais pas qu'elle était anglaise.
          Sans bouger de l'escalier, Georgette lui répond, toujours en
          chuchotant.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Elle ne l'est pas : elle fait semblant.
                         
          Elle redescend vers Gabriel.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Il y a dix ans, elle s'est mis dans la tête de parler
           anglais.
                         
          Elle a rejoint Gabriel, à qui elle parle à voix basse.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Sans doute pour faire bien, pour épater les parents
           d'élève. Le plus beau, c'est qu'il a fallu que je m'y mette
           aussi, sans ça, où est-ce qu'on allait. Les questions
           étaient anglaises et mes réponses françaises.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           C'est ce qui a perdu Jeanne d'Arc.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Ah oui, sûrement... Si je vous disais, monsieur, que j'ai
           soigné, pendant dix ans, le Général Marvier, héros du Bec
           d'Ambès. J'ai fermé les yeux d'un sénateur-maire de la Côte
           d'Or, mon dévouement a permis à la grande Magda Golovina de
           remonter sur scène.
                         
          Elle pointe son doigt sur la poitrine de Gabriel.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Et bien, monsieur, j'affirme que je n'ai jamais payé de ma
           personne comme auprès de Madame Victoria... Jamais !
                         
          Les deux battants de la porte s'ouvrent devant un fauteuil
          roulant, sur lequel la directrice est assise. Elle est habillée
          tout de noir, et ressemble un peu à une vieille dame anglaise dans
          le style de la Miss Marple d'Agatha Christie.
                         
                          MADAME VICTORIA
           What are you doing ? Speaking alone ?...
           (Traduction : Qu'est-ce que vous faites ? Vous parlez toute
           seule ?)
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Madame...
                         
          La directrice se tourne vers lui et le toise d'un regard peu
          aimable.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           This gentleman is a relative of Marie Fouquet.
           (Traduction : Ce monsieur est un parent de Marie Fouquet.)
                         
          La directrice se retourne vers Georgette.
                         
                          MADAME VICTORIA
           Well... What are you waiting for ? Go and fetch the girl.
           (Traduction : Et bien... Qu'est-ce que vous attendez ?
           Allez chercher la fillette.)
                         
          Georgette contourne la chaise roulante et monte l'escalier, le
          paquet de Gabriel dans les mains. Tout en montant, elle se tourne
          vers Gabriel.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Je vous demande deux minutes.
                         
          La directrice retourne son fauteuil roulant vers la double porte
          battante, qui s'ouvre sous la poussée du fauteuil.
                         
          Gabriel la regarde sortir. Il semble songeur. Il fait quelques pas
          dans le hall. Il s'approche d'une grande baie vitrée et regarde
          dans le parc. Puis, après quelques instants de réflexion, il prend
          une décision soudaine et se dirige, à grandes enjambées, vers la
          porte du hall. Il ouvre la porte, sort dehors, et referme la porte
          derrière lui.
                         
          Contrechamp en contre-plongée vers la galerie du premier étage.
          Marie Fouquet, en blouse d'uniforme, et un grand sourire aux
          lèvres, court sur la galerie, puis descend l'escalier quatre à
          quatre. Elle porte, sur son bras, le pull que son père lui a
          offert. Elle s'arrête au bout de quelques marches, et inspecte le
          hall.
                         
          Le hall, vu en plongée, est totalement vide.
                         
          Marie, toujours debout sur une marche, semble très triste. On sent
          que ses larmes sont prêtes à sortir. Elle se retourne et remonte
          lentement l'escalier.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - CAVE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          La cave est plus propre, plus lumineuse, et mieux rangée que
          pendant la guerre. Les étagères son pleines de bouteilles. Suzanne
          et Albert sont en train d'inspecter les bouteilles, chacun sur une
          étagère différente. Ils sont dos à dos. Albert porte un tablier et
          a un crayon et un carnet en main.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Je sais pas ce qu'ils ont, mais ils se sont tous jetés sur
           le Bordeaux, cette année. Fais-moi donc penser à téléphoner
           à Courtine.
                         
          Suzanne se retourne avec une bouteille en main. Elle a une lueur
          inquiète dans le regard.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Albert...
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Hmm...
                         
          Elle marque un léger temps avant de continuer.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           ... je voudrais pas que tu prennes ça mal, mais tu sais, à
           force de vivre ensemble... je sais pas, moi, mais... on
           finit par deviner certaines choses, par sentir euh...
                         
          Elle va pour remettre la bouteille sur l'étagère.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Sentir quoi ?
                         
          Elle se retourne, toujours la bouteille en main.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Oh... Rien de précis, c'est seulement une idée... Mais
           depuis quatre jours, j'ai l'impression que t'es plus tout à
           fait le même. Depuis que monsieur Fouquet est là, tu te
           rends pas compte, mais...
                         
          Albert, qui partait avec un cageot de bouteilles dans les mains,
          se retourne vers sa femme. Il a mis le crayon et le carnet dans la
          poche pectorale de sa chemise.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ah !...
                         
          Il pose le cageot sur un autre cageot.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Nous y voilà. Ma bonne Suzanne, tu viens de commettre ton
           premier faux pas. Y a des femmes qui révèlent à leur mari
           toute une vie d'infidélité, mais toi, tu viens de m'avouer
           quinze années de soupçons, c'est pire.
                         
          Il reprend son cageot et traverse la cave.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Note bien que tu as peut-être raison.
                         
          Il pose le cageot un peu plus loin. Suzanne l'a suivi.
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Qui a bu boira. Ça, faut reconnaître qu'on a le proverbe
           contre nous. Rassure-toi,va, je plaisante.
                         
          Il ricane. Mais Suzanne garde un visage fermé et légèrement
          inquiet.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Qu'est-ce que tu veux qu'il m'arrive ? J'ai une femme qui
           veille sur moi, un métier qui m'occupe, et des bonbons pour
           me distraire, alors...
                         
          Il s'éloigne d'elle.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           D'ailleurs, je vais peut-être les supprimer, les bonbons.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Pourquoi ? Quand une habitude n'est pas mauvaise...
                         
          Elle suit Albert à travers la cave, et pose, au passage, la
          bouteille, qu'elle tenait en main, dans un cageot. Albert arrive
          au pied de l'escalier.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh, y a pas de bonnes habitudes. L'habitude, c'est une
           façon de mourir sur place.
                         
          Il monte l'escalier, Suzanne le suit.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - VESTIBULE DE RÉCEPTION - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Gabriel, en costume et cravate, parle au téléphone, debout et
          accoudé sur le comptoir de réception.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Projet de sketch pour une publicité jumelée... sous-
           vêtements et lessive. Bon, vous y êtes ?...
                         
          Il lit un papier qu'il a posé sur le comptoir.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           En scène, Richelieu...
                         
          Derrière lui, Albert et Suzanne entre par la porte de la cave.
          Albert porte toujours son tablier.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Ben oui, évidemment, le Cardinal !... Il écoute les propos
           d'un capucin barbu qui lui parle à l'oreille. Soudain
           jaillit des coulisse un athlète, vêtu d'un slip immaculé.
                         
          Albert et Suzanne passe derrière lui, se dirigeant vers la salle à
          manger. Albert enlève son tablier, et Suzanne regarde Gabriel, un
          peu étonnée par ses propos surprenants.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Il renvoie d'un geste son conseiller, et désigne l'athlète
           au public en déclarant : « Je croyais que mon éminence
           était grise, mais le sien a la blancheur Persil »...
          HOTEL STELLA - SALLE À MANGER - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Albert et Suzanne se sont installés à leur table, près des
          chambres froides. Sur la table trône une soupière et, à côté de la
          soupière, une bouteille de Vittel. Albert pousse la soupière vers
          Suzanne.
                         
           GABRIEL FOUQUET (voix off)
           Oui, évidemment, ça manque un peu de femmes, mais enfin, on
           verra, hein.
                         
          Pendant que Suzanne se sert de la soupe, Albert regarde en
          direction de Gabriel.
                         
          Contrechamp sur Gabriel, toujours accoudé au comptoir de
          réception, et vu à travers la porte ouverte de la salle à manger.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Bon. Deuxième projet. Pâtes Lustucru à traiter en dessin
           animé. Un chat tente de s'introduire dans une marmite
           pleine de spaghettis.
          Albert regarde toujours Gabriel, puis il tourne la tête vers
          Suzanne qui se sert de la soupe.
                         
           GABRIEL FOUQUET (voix off)
           Surgit le père Lustucru, armé d'une louche. Dialogue.
                         
          Nouveau contrechamp sur Gabriel, vu à travers la porte de la salle
          à manger. Il a maintenant pris son papier en main, et continue à
          le lire.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Le père Lustucru : « A bas les pattes ! » Le chat, avec un
           grand sourire...
                         
          Retour sur Suzanne qui se sert de la soupe, et Albert, qui regarde
          Gabriel.
                         
           GABRIEL FOUQUET (voix off)
           ... « A bas les pattes, sauf les pâtes Lustucru. » Je
           compte sur vous pour fignoler les voix, un peu détimbrée
           pour Lustucru...
                         
          Contrechamp sur Gabriel.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           ... avec beaucoup d'écho... C'est ça, au revoir.
                         
          Il raccroche le téléphone, puis entre dans la salle à manger, et
          se dirige vers sa table. Il n'y a d'ailleurs que deux tables
          dressées dans la salle, chacune à une extrémité de la salle. Celle
          de Gabriel, près de la fenêtre, et celle des patrons, près des
          chambres froides. Toutes les autres tables sont vides et n'ont
          même pas de nappe. Gabriel s'assoit à table et déplie sa
          serviette. Sur sa table, à côté de son couvert, une bouteille de
          vin. Marie-Jo arrive de la cuisine, portant une soupière, qu'elle
          pose sur la table de Gabriel. Elle s'éloigne et Gabriel se sert de
          la soupe.
          Contrechamp sur la table d'Albert et Suzanne, qui mangent leur
          soupe.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           C'est quand même triste un jeune homme seul devant sa
           soupe.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Bien sûr que c'est triste. Seulement, si je l'invite, tu
           diras encore que je manigance des trucs.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Ne parlons plus de ça, va.
                         
          Elle relève la tête et appelle.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Monsieur Fouquet !... Nous n'aurons plus de client à cette
           heure-là, si ça vous ennuie pas de venir à notre table.
                         
          Gabriel regarde Suzanne, puis il se lève et prend sa bouteille de
          vin.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Avec plaisir, chère madame.
                         
          Il traverse la salle, prend une chaise au passage, et l'installe
          en face d'Albert et Suzanne. Il montre la bouteille qu'il tient à
          la main.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Vous permettez ?
                         
          Il s'assoit et Albert se lève.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ah non. Hé, vous êtes notre invité, hein.
                         
          Il prend la bouteille de Gabriel et se dirige vers la cuisine.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Marie-Jo, mettez donc un couvert à monsieur Fouquet, là.
                         
          Il disparaît dans la cuisine. Marie-Jo, qui faisait la plonge, se
          dirige vers la salle. Gabriel se penche vers Suzanne.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Alors, quand on veut conjurer le diable, on l'invite à sa
           table.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Je ne vois pas ce que vous voulez dire, monsieur Fouquet.
                         
          Albert sort de la cuisine, une bonne bouteille à la main.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Tenez, vous allez me goûter ça.
                         
          Il pose la bouteille sur la table.
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ma femme vous tiendra compagnie.
                         
          Il s'assoit à table.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Marie-Jo !
                         
           MARIE-JO (voix off en provenance de la cuisine)
           Oui, monsieur.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Venez donc ouvrir la bouteille, là.
                         
          Il prend la bouteille d'eau minérale et s'en sert un verre, sous
          le regard un peu absent de sa femme, qui gratte inconsciemment la
          nappe.
                         
          Fondu enchaîné.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - PLAGE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
          Marée basse. Plan moyen sur une vieille femme qui, en bordure de
          mer, est en train de ramasser des coquillages dans le sable. Elle
          les dépose dans un cageot. A côté d'elle, une vieille poussette de
          bébé, qui lui sert à transporter son cageot.
                         
          Panoramique sur la plage, où deux autres personnes ramassent aussi
          des coquillages. Il s'agit d'Albert et Gabriel.
                         
          Plan moyen sur eux deux. Gabriel, vêtu d'un blouson de cuir avec
          col de mouton, a les deux pieds dans l'eau, et un grand panier
          plat à la main. Albert, lui, est vêtu d'une canadienne à col de
          fourrure. Il est sur le sable sec et creuse le sable avec ses
          mains pour en extraire les coquillages. Gabriel revient vers
          Albert.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Que ce soit la révolution ou la paella, dites-vous bien que
           rien de ce qui est Espagnol n'est simple.
                         
          Il est arrivé près d'Albert, qui se relève. Il lui montre son
          panier. Albert ramasse son propre panier et ils se mettent en
          marche côte à côte sur la plage.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Une paella sans coquillage, c'est un gigot sans ail, un
           escroc sans rosette, quelque chose qui déplait à Dieu. Au
           temps de mes amours, je confectionnais la paella comme
           personne. Claire me reconnaissait ce talent. J'espère que
           mes déboires ne m'auront pas gâté la main.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Pourquoi buvez-vous ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           La question m'a déjà été posée, monsieur le Proviseur.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Probablement par des gens qui vous aiment bien.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Probablement. Claire me la posait trois fois par semaine,
           elle devait m'adorer. Je croyais que vous étiez un homme
           ennemi des questions.
                         
          Ils croisent la vieille femme, qui traîne sa poussette sur la
          plage. Albert s'arrête de marcher.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           C'est exact, je préfère les réponses.
                         
          Ils sont arrivés devant un endroit où de nombreux petits piquets
          sont plantés dans le sable. Il s'agit de « bouchots », qui sont
          découverts seulement à marée basse, et sur lesquels s'accrochent
          les moules.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           C'est curieux, Claire aussi. « Gabriel, m'aimez-vous ? »
           « Gabriel, pourquoi buvez-vous ? » «Croyez-vous que ce soit
           raisonnable de vous mettre dans cet état-là ? » Sous
           prétexte de vous empêcher de boire, leur rêve, ce serait de
           nous mettre en bouteille.
                         
          Il s'avance entre les bouchots.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ohh... je crois simplement qu'elles ont la trouille.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           La trouille de quoi ? J'ai jamais eu le vin mauvais, plutôt
           affectueux, même grotesque.
                         
          Il pose son panier par terre.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           J'avais, en tout cas, le charme de l'imprévu.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh la-la ! Alors, là, vous êtes complètement à côté, elles
           aiment les valeurs sûres.
                         
          Lui aussi pose son panier au milieu des bouchots. Il ramasse des
          moules collées sur les bouchots et les jette dans son panier.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Attendre un homme et en voir arriver un autre, elles ont
           horreur de ça, d'autant plus que la surprise est rarement
           bonne, faut être juste. Non, croyez-moi, allez, j'ai des
           souvenirs sur la question. Je la vois d'ici, votre Claire,
           avec vos trente-six manières d'arriver saoul. Vous avez dû
           lui foutre le vertige.
                         
          Gabriel, lui aussi, ramasse des moules sur les bouchots, et les
          jette dans son panier.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Possible.
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ben, c'est certain. Notez bien que tout ça ne me regarde
           pas. J'ai peut-être un peu usé de mon droit d'ancienneté.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Y a pas de mal, j'ai toujours fait plus jeune que mon âge.
           N'empêche que j'ai une fille de dix ans.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Alors, là, vous êtes con.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Cette fois, vous abusez.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Quand on a un enfant, y a des choses qu'on n'a pas le droit
           de faire. Comment s'appelle-t-elle ?
                         
          Gabriel ramasse son panier et se rapproche d'Albert
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Marie. J'étais venu ici pour la chercher, et puis...
          Il fait un geste vague de la main. Albert ramasse son panier. Ils
          sortent tous deux du parc à bouchots et se remettent en marche sur
          la plage.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Elle est pensionnaire au cours Dillon. Dites-moi, monsieur
           Quentin, puisqu'on en était aux indiscrétions, lorsque vous
           étiez en Chine, vous fumiez l'opium ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ohhh... Y a rien d'indiscret. Oui, ça m'est arrivé, à
           Shanghaï, à Hong-Kong... Mais rien de bien extraordinaire.
           On rêvassait.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Vous n'aimiez pas rêver ?
                         
          Albert s'arrête de marcher. Gabriel aussi.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ben, ça dépend de la qualité des choses. Là, c'était des
           rêves de fusilier-marin. L'amiral Guépratte m'embrassait
           sur l'oreille, ou bien le thé avait un goût d'anisette. Des
           petits délires grisants, sans plus.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Et maintenant ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Maintenant, il m'arrive de rêver que je fume, ça doit être
           le retour d'âge.
                         
          On entend des cris d'enfants dans le lointain. Les deux hommes
          tournent la tête vers ces rires.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Tiens ! Voilà le cours Dillon.
          Contrechamp en plan général sur la plage. On voit arriver le
          groupe de fillettes, toutes vêtues du même manteau de couleur
          sombre, des mêmes chaussettes blanches, et de la même jupe
          écossaise. Derrière elles, une rangée de belles maisons normandes
          en bordure de plage. Elles sont menée par une maîtresse en manteau
          gris.
                         
          Albert récupère le panier de Gabriel.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Allez, je vous laisse en famille.
                         
          Il s'éloigne. Gabriel fait quelques pas vers la mer. Il prend une
          petite flasque vide dans la poche arrière de son pantalon.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Et une bouteille à la mer !
                         
          Il lance la flasque dans l'eau.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Vous verrez, monsieur Fouquet, un jour, vous finirez par
           rêver que vous buvez.
                         
          Il se retourne et s'éloigne, avec un panier dans chaque main.
                         
          Un peu plus loin sur la plage, le groupe de fillettes est en train
          de jouer près d'un blockhaus. Deux petites filles se détachent du
          groupe, l'une courant après l'autre. Celle de derrière finit par
          rattraper celle de devant, qui n'est autre que Marie, la fille de
          Gabriel, et la plaque dans le sable. Les deux filles commencent à
          se battre. La maîtresse se détache du groupe et vient vers elles.
                         
                          LA MAÎTRESSE
           Marie Fouquet, assez !
                         
          Les deux filles arrêtent de se battre, se relèvent et se dirigent
          vers la maîtresse.
                         
                          LA MAÎTRESSE
           Voulez-vous venir ici tout de suite ! Qu'est-ce que c'est
           que ces manières ? Jouez par ici.
                         
          Gabriel arrive en courant, mais trop tard : les deux filles ont
          déjà rejoint la maîtresse. Il contourne le blockhaus.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - BLOCKHAUS SUR LA PLAGE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Gabriel entre dans le blockhaus par une ouverture irrégulière,
          probablement faite par un explosif. Derrière lui, par l'ouverture,
          on aperçoit les fillettes qui continuent à jouer. Gabriel se cache
          derrière l'un des pans de mur déchiquetés, qui bordent l'entrée,
          et ce afin de ne pas être vu par les fillettes. Les filles se
          rassemblent un cours instant autour de la maîtresse, qui dit :
                         
                          LA MAÎTRESSE
           C'est parti !
                         
          Puis les filles s'éparpillent comme une volée de moineaux,
          accompagnées de la maîtresse. Seule Marie reste au milieu de la
          plage, les yeux fermés. Deux filles courent vers le blockhaus.
          Gabriel s'enfonce vers l'intérieur du blockhaus, puis il se cache
          derrière un pan de mur. Les deux filles entrent et se cachent
          chacune d'un côté de l'entrée.
                         
                          MARIE FOUQUET
           Deux, trois, quatre, cinq ! Ça y est !
                         
          Elle ouvre les yeux et se retourne. La maîtresse vient vers elle,
          déplie un siège pliant, et s'assoit dessus. Marie court vers le
          blockhaus, et lorsqu'elle arrive devant, elle s'arrête et met ses
          mains en porte-voix.
                         
                          MARIE FOUQUET
           Défense de se cacher dans le blockhaus !
                         
          Puis elle part en courant sur la gauche.
                         
                          PREMIÈRE FILLETTE
           Tu parles d'une andouille.
          Plan rapproché sur le visage de Gabriel, qui sort
          précautionneusement de sa cachette.
                         
           DEUXIÈME FILLETTE (voix off)
           La prochaine fois, on a qu'à la semer en route.
                         
           PREMIÈRE FILLETTE (voix off)
           Laisse-la faire, ça lui fera les pieds... Allez, on y va ?
                         
           DEUXIÈME FILLETTE (voix off)
           Et si elle est encore là ?
                         
          Retour sur les deux fillettes.
                         
                          PREMIÈRE FILLETTE
           On dira qu'elle triche, ça la fera pleurer.
                         
          Elles se faufilent lestement en dehors du blockhaus. La maîtresse,
          absorbée par la lecture d'un livre, ne semble pas s'apercevoir de
          leur présence.
                         
          Gabriel sort lentement de sa cachette. Il regarde vers la mer avec
          de la tristesse dans les yeux.
                         
          Fondu enchainé.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - SALLE À MANGER - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Toutes la salle à manger à été nettoyée et rangée. Toutes les
          chaises sont posées à l'envers sur les tables. Seule, la grande
          table ronde au fond de la salle, près des chambres froides, est
          dressée. Albert, Suzanne et Gabriel sont en train de terminer la
          paella préparée par Gabriel. Albert chante.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           On l'appelait le Dénicheur ! Il était rusé comme une
           fouine. C'était un gars qu'avait pas peur, et qui
           connaissait les combines. Le soir, sur les boul'
           extérieurs, quand on voyait passer sa dame, on s'écriait
           sur toutes les gammes : « Ça, ben, c'est la femme à
           Dénicheur ».
                         
          Il s'arrête de chanter.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ah, dans ce temps-là, hein...
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           ... on savait faire les chansons.
                         
          Elle semble légèrement « pompette » ! A côté d'elle, une bouteille
          de vin dans un seau à glace.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Hé oui !
                         
          Marie-Jo passe derrière Suzanne, et ramasse la grande sauteuse,
          qui contenait la paella.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Monsieur Fouquet, votre paella est une splendeur. Ah, celle
           qui vous épousera aura de la chance.
                         
          Elle finit son verre de vin.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je crains, malheureusement, chère madame, qu'on ne
           s'attache pas une femme avec des vertus culinaires...
                         
          Il prend la bouteille dans le seau et ressert Suzanne.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           ... avec des vertus d'aucune sorte, d'ailleurs.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Moi, je dis qu'on peut très bien apprécier les hommages
           déposés dans un plat.
                         
          Gabriel se sert à son tour. Suzanne se tourne vers son mari.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Si Albert avait daigné un jour faire la cuisine pour moi
           toute seule, j'aurais considéré ça comme un madrigal.
                         
          Gabriel repose la bouteille dans le seau. Suzanne porte son verre
          à ses lèvres.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Mais il m'a jamais offert même une omelette.
                         
          Elle boit. Gabriel la regarde en souriant.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ben, qu'est-ce que tu racontes ? D'octobre en avril, on est
           à peu près seuls. Alors, tu peux considérer que, pendant
           six mois de l'année, je ne fais la tambouille que pour te
           rendre hommage ?
          Suzanne le regarde avec le sourire un peu niais de quelqu'un qui a
          un peu trop bu. Gabriel boit lentement son verre.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           C'est vrai.
                         
          Elle se tourne vers Gabriel.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Au fond, c'est beau. Monsieur Fouquet ?... Vous connaissez
           La Bourboule ?
                         
          Gabriel baisse son verre en souriant.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Ma foi, non.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Et ben, vous avez tort. C'est là que j'ai connu Albert. Il
           était en permission libérable. Il portait un blazer à
           rayures, et un canotier... avec ruban assorti. Bel homme,
           et il le savait.
          Marie-Jo vient débarrasser les assiettes.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           C'était le début de la Biguine. Tu te rappelles le disque
           de Dranem ?
                         
          Elle se met à chanter en tapotant sur la table. Gabriel sourit.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           C'est la biguine, il n'y a rien de plus coquin.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Suzanne !
                         
          Il semble un peu gêné.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Oh pourquoi ! Y a pas de mal. On est que tous les trois.
           C'était en juillet, y avait des mimosas. Tu portais des
           bottines de toile. Je m'en rappelle comme si c'était hier.
                         
          Elle se tourne vers Gabriel.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Vous voyez, moi, j'aurais bien aimé une auberge dans le
           midi, mais Albert a pas voulu. Il a voulu qu'on s'installe
           ici à cause du mauvais temps, pour qu'il y ait moins de
           monde, vous voyez ce que c'est que la séduction. C'est
           drôle que vous ne connaissiez pas La Bourboule, un homme
           comme vous.
                         
          Elle ricane niaisement et reprend une gorgée de son verre. Albert
          s'adresse à Gabriel avec un petit sourire en coin.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et bien, vous voyez, elle, ça la conduit à La Bourboule !
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Tenez, on est entre nous... Voulez-vous que je vous
           dise ?...
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mais enfin, Suzanne, notre voyage de noces n'intéresse pas
           monsieur Fouquet.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Vous n'aimez pas les voyages ? Albert est imbattable là-
           dessus. Si je vous disais qu'il connait les horaires de
           tous les trains d'Europe, même les horaires de
           correspondance.
                         
          Albert pose sa serviette et se lève.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh, ben écoute, arrête... Oh, arrête !
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Oh, Albert, sois gentil, montre tes horaires à monsieur
           Fouquet.
          Marie-Jo vient déposer une corbeille de fruits sur la table.
          Albert ouvre un tiroir du buffet situé à côté de la table.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mais ça ne l'intéresse pas.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Mais si, voyons, au contraire.
                         
          Albert sort une boite de cigare du tiroir.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Ah, tu vois ! Même pour les petits déplacements, c'est
           pareil.
                         
          Elle se lève et se dirige vers un buffet situé de l'autre côté de
          la table. Albert tend la boite de cigares à Gabriel, qui en prend
          un. Gabriel écoute le babillage de Suzanne tout en regardant
          Albert avec une lueur amusée dans les yeux.
                         
           SUZANNE QUENTIN (voix off)
           Tenez, il doit partir demain soir pour Blangy. Et ben, il a
           déjà en poche son aller et retour...
                         
          Elle fouille dans le tiroir du buffet.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           ... sa correspondance, sa chambre d'hôtel retenue, tout.
           C'est pas quelque chose, ça ?
                         
          Elle sort du tiroir un gros classeur, referme le tiroir et revient
          vers la table sur laquelle elle pose le classeur, puis elle
          s'assoit. Gabriel, le visage soudain un peu grave, tripote son
          cigare sans l'allumer.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je ne savais pas que vous partiez.
          Albert s'assoit et prend un cigare dans la boite.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh, pour deux jours. Tous les ans, à la Toussaint, je vais
           sur la tombe de mon père en Picardie. Mais vous serez
           surement encore là à mon retour ?
                         
          Il regarde Gabriel qui ne lui répond pas, puis qui se lève.
          Suzanne, elle, est en train de sortir les livres d'horaires de
          train du classeur.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Bon, ben, je vous souhaite un bon voyage, monsieur Quentin.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Vous nous quittez déjà ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Oui, je vais me dégourdir un peu les jambes avant de
           monter.
          Il met le cigare dans la poche de sa veste sur le porte-manteau,
          puis décroche la veste.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et bien, vous ne savez pas ce que vous perdez, parce que je
           vous avais mis de côté un vieux calva de trente ans.
                         
          Gabriel enfile sa veste et noue son cache-nez.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je veux pas vous retarder. Demain, c'est dimanche, vous
           partez le soir, vous aurez une journée chargée. Merci pour
           cette excellente soirée.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Oh, c'était tout simple.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Mais familial.
                         
          Il s'éloigne dans le vestibule vers la porte de l'hôtel
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Tu lui offres du calva, c'est malin ! Heureusement qu'il
           est raisonnable.
                         
          On entend la porte d'entrée qui se ferme. Albert se lève, le
          cigare au bec, et se dirige vers la baie vitrée qui donne sur la
          rue.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - RUE HÔTEL STELLA - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Plan rapprochée sur les vitres de l'hôtel. On voit Albert, le
          cigare au bec, qui regarde la rue par-dessus les rideaux.
                         
          Contrechamp sur Gabriel qui se dirige vers le Café Normand, mais
          qui passe devant sans s'arrêter.
          HOTEL STELLA - CHAMBRE ALBERT - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Albert allume la lumière et entre dans la chambre. Suzanne le suit
          et referme la porte. Albert sort un bonbon de sa poche, le sort de
          son emballage et s'approche de la fenêtre entr'ouverte.

          Plan rapproché sur la fenêtre d'Albert qui met le bonbon dans sa
          bouche et s'appuie sur la rambarde pour regarder dans la rue d'un
          air pensif. Derrière lui, Suzanne prépare le lit.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Tout de même, quand je pense, du calva... Avoue que c'est
           une trouvaille ! C'est simple, t'aurais voulu le faire
           boire, tu t'y serais pas pris autrement.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Si. J'aurais bu avec lui.
                         
          Suzanne se retourne vers son mari.
          Contrechamp de la rue vue de la fenêtre d'Albert. Gabriel revient
          de sa « promenade » et pose la main sur la poignée de la porte du
          Café Normand. Il s'arrête et regarde vers la fenêtre d'Albert. Il
          fait quelques pas dans la rue, et fait un grand salut à Albert.
          Puis il retourne vers l'entrée du café, ouvre la porte et entre
          dans l'établissement.
                         
          Retour sur Albert, qui regarde toujours dans la rue, accoudé à la
          rambarde de la fenêtre.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Albert, tu parlais pas sérieusement ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Tu crois pas que tu ferais mieux de te coucher.
                         
          Il crache son bonbon dans la rue.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Réponds-moi d'abord.
                         
          Il ferme la fenêtre.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - CHAMBRE ALBERT - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Albert finit de fermer la fenêtre, et se tourne vers sa femme.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Écoute, ma bonne Suzanne, t'es une épouse modèle.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Oh !...
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mais si, t'as que des qualités, et physiquement, t'es
           restée comme je pouvais l'espérer. C'est le bonheur rangé
           dans une armoire. Et tu vois, même si c'était à refaire, et
           bien je crois que je t'épouserais de nouveau. Mais tu
           m'emmerdes.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Albert !
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Tu m'emmerdes gentiment, affectueusement, avec amour, mais
           tu m'emmerdes !
                         
          Il s'éloigne un peu d'elle, dont on voit le visage contrarié dans
          le miroir.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           J'ai pas encore les pieds dans le trou, mais ça vient, Bon
           Dieu, tu te rends pas compte que ça vient. Et plus ça
           vient, plus je m'aperçois que j'ai pas eu ma ration
           d'imprévu, et j'en redemande ! T'entends, j'en redemande.
                         
          Il s'est un peu énervé au fur et à mesure qu'il parlait.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           L'imprévu ? Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
          Albert lui répond d'une voix plus calme.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh ! Rien, c'est des idées d'un autre monde. Et puis, ne
           parlons plus de ça, va.
                         
          Il se rapproche d'elle.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Parce que, tu sais, si ça te manquait vraiment, si t'y
           pensais trop, tu pourrais... je sais pas, moi... reprendre
           un peu de vin au repas... un demi-verre.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Un demi-verre ? Dis-toi bien que si quelque chose devait me
           manquer, ce serait plus le vin, ce serait l'ivresse !
                         
          Il s'éloigne de Suzanne, qui ne bouge pas et reste très pensive.
                         
          Fondu au noir.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - RUE HÔTEL STELLA - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Deux touristes allemands sortent des bagages du coffre avant de
          leur voiture : une Coccinelle Volkswagen, dont le moteur, lui, est
          situé à l'arrière. L'homme parle en allemand à sa femme. Il
          referme le coffre, prend les valises et se dirige vers l'entrée de
          l'hôtel. Derrière eux, est garée une grosse voiture américaine
          noire.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - SALLE À MANGER - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Par la porte ouverte entre la salle à manger et le vestibule, on
          voit Marie-Jo, qui se dirige vers le couple de touristes
          allemands, qui vient d'entrer. Elle prend les valises des mains de
          l'homme. Le couple entre dans la salle à manger, dont presque
          toutes les tables sont occupées. Albert, portant un tablier blanc,
          est occupé à servir des clients. Il se redresse vers les nouveaux
          arrivants.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Messieurs-dames. Germaine !
                         
          Il vient de se tourner vers une serveuse habillée de noir et
          portant un tablier blanc. Il s'agit d'une serveuse qui ne vient
          travailler à l'hôtel que lorsque l'affluence le nécessite.
          Germaine entraîne le couple allemand vers une table libre. Albert
          se tourne vers Suzanne, qui vient d'entrer, un calepin à la main,
          et désigne une table libre, sur laquelle est installée un service
          de petit-déjeuner, qui n'a pas été touché.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Tiens, Suzanne, débarrasse-moi ça.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Mais c'est le petit-déjeuner de monsieur Fouquet.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oui, et ben, à cette heure-là, une aspirine lui suffira.
          TIGREVILLE - RUE HÔTEL STELLA - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          L'homme au béret, l'habitué de chez Esnault, qui travaille au
          Cours Dillon, court dans la rue et entre précipitamment dans
          l'hôtel.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - SALLE À MANGER - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          L'homme au béret entre dans la salle, et regarde autour de lui. Il
          avise Suzanne et se tourne vers elle.
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Albert est là ?
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Il est à la cuisine.
                         
          L'homme se précipite vers la cuisine.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - CUISINE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Albert a ouvert le four et est en train de surveiller un plat qui
          cuit à l'intérieur. L'homme au béret entre précipitamment.
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Quentin ! Y a ton Espagnol qu'est au carrefour.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mais alors ? C'est pas son droit d'être au carrefour ?
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Mais pas de faire ce qu'il fait ! Ah, tu peux pas savoir.
           C'est une catastrophe !
                         
          TIGREVILLE - CARREFOUR - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Un carrefour avec une rue qui monte vers une propriété privée,
          dont le portail est ouvert. Une foule est massée derrière la
          barrière de la propriété, et d'autres personnes sont groupées, en-
          dessous d'eux, au bord de la route. Mais on ne voit pas encore ce
          qu'ils regardent. Par contre, on entend leurs éclats de voix.
                         
          Une DS Citroën zigzague sur la route et s'arrête devant le
          portail. Le conducteur descend précipitamment de son véhicule, et
          se dirige vers le centre du carrefour. Gabriel est debout au
          milieu de la route, la veste à la main.
                         
                          LE CONDUCTEUR
           Vous êtes complètement cinglé, non ?
                         
          Gabriel salue le conducteur. Une autre voiture arrive à vive
          allure d'une route qui descend vers le carrefour.
                         
          A son passage, Gabriel fait une « passe » avec sa veste, à la
          manière d'un matador.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Olé !
          Le conducteur, certainement affolé, perd un peu le contrôle de son
          véhicule, et se précipite vers un groupe de personnes, massés
          devant une boutique d'antiquités. Les gens s'éparpillent en
          courant. Heureusement, la voiture réussit à s'arrêter, sans
          toucher personne. Une autre voiture, une grosse américaine,
          arrivant en sens inverse du centre ville, klaxonne, car son
          conducteur ne comprend pas la manoeuvre étrange du premier
          véhicule.
                         
          VOITURE AMÉRICAINE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Gabriel, vu à travers le pare-brise de la voiture, agite sa veste
          devant la voiture, qui s'arrête juste devant lui. Il pointe une
          épée imaginaire et la plante dans le pare-brise, comme s'il
          donnait l'estocade finale au taureau qu'il venait de combattre.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - CARREFOUR - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          L'intérieur du véhicule, vu de la rue. Un homme est au volant,
          deux femmes sont assises à l'arrière. Il semble tous un peu
          affolés par ce qu'il vient de leur arriver.
                         
                          LE CONDUCTEUR
           I say, you're crazy !
           (traduction : Dis donc, vous êtes fou !)
                         
          Gabriel se tourne vers la foule massée derrière la barrière de la
          propriété, et qui l'acclame. On lui lance même un chapeau, qu'il
          attrape au vol. Gabriel marche le long de la route, saluant la
          foule en brandissant le chapeau.
                         
          Il revient vers le centre du carrefour, et lance le chapeau, prêt
          à affronter un autre « taureau » automobile ! Une 404 blanche,
          venant de la route qui descend vers la ville, le frôle à vive
          allure.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Olé !
                          LA FOULE
           Olé ! Olé ! Olé !...
                         
          Une autre voiture, venant du centre ville, évite Gabriel de
          justesse. Elle s'arrête au milieu du carrefour, et le conducteur
          en sort précipitamment. Il fonce vers Gabriel.
                         
          Gabriel fait une passe sur une autre voiture en provenance de la
          ville.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Olé !
                         
          Une voiture noire arrive de la route, et zigzague pour essayer
          d'éviter Gabriel.
                         
          Contrchamp sur Gabriel, au milieu du carrefour, qui bouge de
          droite à gauche, pour essayer de rester dans l'axe de la voiture.
          On a l'impression que la caméra est placée sur la voiture. Zoom
          avant sur Gabriel qui se rapproche. Sa veste passe sur l'objectif
          de la caméra, comme si elle passait sur le pare-brise de la
          voiture. Puis on voit la foule qui s'écarte pour éviter la
          voiture.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Olé !...
                         
          La foule entoure Gabriel toujours debout au milieu du carrefour,
          et l'acclame.
                         
          Vue aérienne de la route qui revient vers le centre ville.
          Gabriel, entouré de ses admirateurs, marche vers la ville. On
          entend des klaxons.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - UNE RUE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Albert et l'homme au béret marchent d'un pas rapide, allant au-
          devant du cortège qui entoure Gabriel. Tous, d'ailleurs, dans ceux
          qui le suivent, ne semblent pas enthousiastes à son sujet. On
          entend, en effet, un conducteur mécontent.
                         
           UN CONDUCTEUR MÉCONTENT (voix off)
           Espèce de salaud ! Je vais t'arranger le portrait, moi.
                         
          Albert rejoint Gabriel et la foule qui l'entoure.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Alors quoi ? Qu'est-ce qu'y a ? Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
                         
           UNE FEMME SUR LE TROTTOIR
           Si c'est pas une honte ! Faire ça le jour des morts !
                         
          Un homme, d'aspect cossu et bourgeois, marche à côté de son
          chauffeur en uniforme.
                         
                          L'HOMME COSSU
           Si mon chauffeur n'avait pas freiné, on l'écrasait !
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Il a freiné ? Et ben alors, c'est fini, n'en parlons plus.
                         
                          L'HOMME COSSU
           Ce serait trop commode ! On est venu en pèlerinage, nous,
           monsieur, on n'est pas venu au cirque !
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et bien, allez-y à votre pèlerinage, la route est libre.
                         
           UNE FEMME SUR LE TROTTOIR
           Y a pas longtemps !
                         
          Il prend le bras de Gabriel et l'entraîne avec lui.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Allez, viens, toi.
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Ben, dis donc, Albert, tu vas quand même pas prendre sa
           défense !
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mais je prends la défense de personne. Vous voyez pas qu'il
           est pas dans son état normal ?
                         
          Un peu plus loin. Albert tient toujours le bras de Gabriel, suivi
          par la foule. Gabriel dit trois mots en espagnol, puis :
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           J'attends la présidence pour m'offrir les oreilles ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Vous pourriez pas faire un entracte, non ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Yo soy unico !
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Fermez-la, mon vieux, oh, fermez-la.
                         
          Le cortège arrive devant la gendarmerie. A côté de la porte, une
          affiche sur laquelle est inscrit : « Jeunes gens - Effectuez votre
          service légal outre-mer - En devançant l'appel de votre classe. »
          Deux gendarmes sortent de la gendarmerie.
                         
          Gabriel leur fait un grand salut de la main.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Olé, carabineros ! Como va ustedes ?
                         
          Maurice, le brigadier, qui a un fort accent du Sud-Ouest, se
          tourne vers Albert.
                         
                          MAURICE
           Alors, vous trouvez qu'on n'a pas assez de travail
           aujourd'hui. Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
                         
          Une voix sort de la foule, celle du monsieur avec chauffeur.
                         
                          L'HOMME COSSU
           Y a que ce petit crétin a failli faire au moins dix
           accidents !
                         
          Albert se tourne vers lui.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Y en a pas eu, d'accident.
                         
           Il se tourne vers Maurice.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Il a bu un coup, c'est pas une affaire, quoi.
                         
           MAURICE (voix off)
           Et d'où qui sort ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           C'est un client à moi.
                         
          Retour sur Maurice, qui écarte les bras.
                         
                          MAURICE
           Client ! C'est pas un état-civil, ça, client ! Vous n'êtes
           pas d'ici, hein ?
                         
          Contrechamp sur la foule massée au pied de la gendarmerie, dont
          l'entrée est légèrement surélevée par rapport au niveau de la rue.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Et vous, vous êtes d'ici, avec votre accent du Cantal ?
                         
                          MAURICE
           Rodez ! Dans le Cantal ? Il est saoul comme une bourrique !
                         
          Il se tourne vers son collègue.
                         
                          MAURICE
           Alexandre, embarquez-moi monsieur, qu'on regarde ses
           papiers.
                         
          Le gendarme Alexandre descend les quelques marches qui mènent à la
          rue et prend Gabriel par le bras. Il le pousse vers le haut des
          marches et l'entrée de la gendarmerie. Albert les suit.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           La sortie en triomphe ! Enfin ! Regarde, public ingrat !
           Arrache-toi les yeux !
                         
          Pour ponctuer encore la sortie théâtrale de Gabriel, les cloches
          de l'église se mettent à sonner.
                         
          Après que Gabriel soit entré dans la gendarmerie, la foule
          commence à se disperser.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - PLACE DE L'ÉGLISE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Plan d'ensemble de la place devant l'église. C'est la sortie de la
          messe. Les petites pensionnaires, dans leur uniforme sombre, mais
          avec la capuche relevée, sortent de l'église en rang deux par
          deux, précédées par la directrice dans son fauteuil roulant,
          poussé par une maîtresse en manteau gris. A la fin du cortège,
          Marie Fouquet marche toute seule derrière les autres.
                         
          Le cortège contourne l'église. Derrière l'église, on aperçoit la
          gendarmerie avec les mots « Gendarmerie Nationale » inscrits sur
          le haut du bâtiment.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - GENDARMERIE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Plan moyen sur Gabriel assis sur une chaise, le menton dans les
          mains. Il écoute distraitement Maurice le brigadier, que l'on ne
          voit pas.
                         
           MAURICE (voix off)
           Fouquet Gabriel, né à Paris le 18 mai 1930. Domicile : 14,
           rue Lincoln, Paris huitième. Profession...
                         
          Maurice, qui est en train de lire la carte d'identité de Gabriel,
          prononce Lincoln à la française. Panoramique découvrant Maurice
          assis derrière son bureau, et Albert devant. L'autre gendarme est
          assis sur un fauteuil derrière Albert.
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mais enfin, Maurice, puisque je te dis que je me porte
           garant pour lui, alors laisse tomber, quoi. Tu peux bien
           faire ça pour moi.
                         
          Gabriel se lève péniblement.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Muchas gracias, señor, seulement, je suis adulte...
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Monsieur Fouquet, vous commencez à nous cassez les noix, on
           ne veut plus vous entendre, on en a marre.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Parfait... puisqu'on peut plus rien dire, je vous attends
           dehors.
                         
          Gabriel ramasse sa veste sur une petite table et se dirige vers la
          porte.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ça va, c'est ça, allez prendre l'air, ça vous fera du bien.
                         
          Gabriel sort de la gendarmerie. Albert se tourne vers Maurice.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Tu vois bien que c'est de l'enfantillage. Demain, il sera
           parti, et personne n'y pensera plus.
                         
                          MAURICE
           Bon, mais tu le ramènes chez toi, hein ? Que je le voie
           plus en train de trainer en ville. Et que ça lui serve de
           leçon.
                         
          Maurice se lève et tend la carte d'identité de Gabriel à Albert.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ben, j'espère, ou alors il est incorrigible.
                         
          Alors qu'Albert se dirige vers la sortie, le téléphone sonne.
          Maurice se dirige vers l'imposant poste téléphonique fixé au mur,
          et décroche.
                         
                          MAURICE
           Allo, ici la gendarmerie de Tigreville. Comment ? Qu'est-ce
           que vous dites ?
                         
          On entend la porte qui se ferme. Le gendarme Alexandre se lève et
          soulève légèrement le rideau pour voir ce qu'il se passe dehors.
                         
                          MAURICE
           Y a un bouchon terrible à Hennequeville ?
                         
          TIGREVILLE - PLACE DE L'ÉGLISE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Albert sort de la gendarmerie et commence à contourner l'église.
          Il retrouve Gabriel assis sur les marches devant le monument aux
          morts, la tête dans les mains. Albert s'approche de lui.
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et ben, qu'est-ce qui vous prend ?
                         
          Gabriel relève la tête.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je crois que j'ai honte.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Allons, mon gars, on n'a pas le droit d'avoir honte, quand
           on a réussi une corrida comme la votre. Hein ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           La deuxième voiture était difficile, elle chargeait
           toujours à gauche, vous avez vu ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Les voitures anglaises, c'est toujours comme ça. C'est la
           déformation. Allez, venez.
                         
          Il lui rend sa carte d'identité et l'aide à se relever. Gabriel
          récupère son document et descend les marches.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Où on va ? J'irai bien prendre un verre. Pas pour boire,
           pour me remonter.
                         
          Albert le regarde un instant, puis dit :
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           D'accord, mais pas chez Esnault.
                         
          Il lui prend le coude et l'entraîne avec lui.
                         
          BAR « CHINOIS » - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          En quinze ans, les marches qui permettent d'accéder au bar
          « chinois » en haut de sa colline, n'ont pas changé : elles sont
          toujours aussi « rustiques ». Albert et Gabriel les montent
          lentement. Gabriel regarde la bâtisse au sommet de la colline et
          s'arrête sur une marche. La bâtisse, non plus, n'a pas changé.
          Seule la tour métallique surmontée par les sirènes a disparu.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Dites donc...
                         
          Albert s'arrête et se tourne vers Gabriel.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Quoi ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Qu'est-ce que c'est que votre endroit ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et bien, les gourmands, ils disent que c'est une maison de
           passe et les vicelards un restaurant chinois.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Vous y allez souvent ?
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           J'y allais.
                         
          Il reprend son escalade, suivi par Gabriel.
                         
          Ils sont presque arrivés au sommet. Gabriel regarde la bâtisse et
          s'arrête de nouveau.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           A votre avis, pour ce qu'on veut en faire, vaudrait mieux
           que ce soit canaille ou chinois ?
                         
          Albert s'est arrêté pour l'écouter.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Que ce soit fermé.
                         
          Il reprend sa marche.
                         
          BAR « CHINOIS » - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          L'intérieur du bar « chinois » n'a pas changé non plus.
                         
          Albert ouvre la porte, et entre suivi par Gabriel, qui referme la
          porte derrière eux. Ils se dirigent vers le bar, lorsqu'ils sont
          arrêtés par une voix venant du haut de l'escalier.
                         
           GEORGINA (voix off)
           Albert !
                         
          Les deux hommes tournent la tête vers l'escalier.
                         
          Georgina descend l'escalier. Elle n'a, pour ainsi dire, pas changé
          en quinze ans.
                         
                          GEORGINA
           C'est pas possible ! C'est un revenant !
          Elle regarde Albert avec un grand sourire.
                         
                          GEORGINA
           Tiens, je suis trop contente. Tu permets que je
           t'embrasse ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Je te permets.
                         
          Elle lui fait une bise sur chaque joue. Albert se tourne vers
          Gabriel.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Je te présente un matador.
                         
          Georgina s'incline légèrement en souriant.
                         
                          GEORGINA
           Enchantée, monsieur.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mais je te promets pas qu'il soit tout à fait authentique.
                         
          Georgina se dirige vers le bar, suivie par ses deux clients.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ici non plus, c'est pas très authentique, mais avec le vent
           du Tibet, ça peut faire illusion. Tenez, mon vieux, si je
           vous disais que, certains soirs, hein, derrière ce mur, là,
           et bien j'ai vu... Pas cru voir, hein !... J'ai vu !... Une
           ville, des tramways, la foule, des drames...
                         
          Un plan rapide sur le mur dont parle Albert, et sur lequel il y a
          seulement la grande affiche légale contre la répression de
          l'ivresse sur la voie publique, entourée d'aquarelles
          « chinoisantes » et d'une réclame pour l'apéritif « Saint
          Raphaël ».
                         
          Retour vers le bar, derrière lequel trône Georgina.
                         
                          GEORGINA
           Qu'est-ce que je vous sers ?
                         
          Albert se tourne vers Gabriel.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Qu'est-ce que vous voulez comme remontant ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je vous fais confiance.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Bon. Est-ce que tu confectionnes toujours ton espèce de
           saké, là ?
                         
                          GEORGINA
           Bien sûr.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Alors, ça sera deux.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - RUE HÔTEL STELLA - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Plan rapproché en contre-plongée de l'enseigne éclairée de l'hôtel
          Stella.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - SALLE À MANGER - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Suzanne est assise seule à une petite table près des chambres
          froides, et sur laquelle est dressé un couvert pour deux
          personnes. Mais les assiettes sont vides et la carafe de vin n'a
          pas été entamée. La tête appuyée sur la main, Suzanne semble
          rêveuse. Derrière elle, on entend le brouhaha de la salle à
          manger. D'un seul coup, Suzanne se lève d'un bond.
                         
          Panoramique rapide vers l'entrée de la salle. Marie-Jo entre et
          pose son manteau sur le porte-manteau.
                         
                          MARIE-JO
           Y a surement aucune raison de s'inquiéter.
          Elle s'approche de Suzanne. Derrière les deux femmes, on
          s'aperçoit que la moitié environ des tables sont occupées.
          Germaine fait le service.
                         
                          MARIE-JO
           Depuis ce matin au carrefour, personne n'a revu monsieur.
           Je suis allé chez Landru, chez le pâtissier, j'ai même été
           chez Esnault, ben... y a pas plus de monsieur que de beurre
           au...
                         
          Elle fait un geste vague pour éviter de dire une bêtise. Elle
          sourit.
                         
                          MARIE-JO
           Si y avait eu un accident, ça se saurait.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Bien sûr, ça se saurait.
                         
          Suzanne se dirige vers la sortie de la salle. Marie-Jo la suit.
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - VESTIBULE DE RÉCEPTION - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Suzanne commence à monter l'escalier. Marie-Jo, en sortant,
          s'aperçoit de la présence d'une valise dans le vestibule.
                         
                          MARIE-JO
           Tiens, la valise de monsieur. Qu'est-ce que j'en fais ?
                         
          Suzanne s'arrête un instant, puis reprend sa marche.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Vous pouvez la remonter. Maintenant, son train de huit
           heures...
                         
                          MARIE-JO
           Monsieur Fouquet n'a pas dîné ?
          Suzanne, qui est presque arrivée à l'étage, se retourne.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Non.
                         
                          MARIE-JO
           Si ça se trouve, ils sont ensemble.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Si ça se trouve, oui.
                         
          Elle reprend sa marche. Marie-Jo se penche pour ramasser la
          valise.
                         
          BAR « CHINOIS » - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Plan rapproché sur le comptoir du bar, sur lequel plusieurs verres
          de vin sont alignés. Gabriel remplit les verres. Zoom arrière
          découvrant Albert et Gabriel, debout devant le bar et en train de
          chanter.
                         
           ALBERT QUENTIN & GABRIEL FOUQUET (ensemble)
           Tata-talalala ! Tata-lalatin ! Tata-talalala ! Tata-
           lalatin !
                         
          Albert prend un verre.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           A l'Amiral Guépratte !
                         
          Il boit. Gabriel prend un verre.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           A el Gallo, le Divin Chauve !
                         
          Il boit. Ils reposent tous deux leurs verres vides. Albert prend
          un autre verre.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           A la gloire des fusiliers marins d'Extrême-Orient !
                         
          Il boit. Gabriel prend un autre verre.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           A Manolete ! Tué à Linarès par le taureau Isleiro !
                         
          Il boit. Albert repose son verre et en prend un autre.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et celui-là, je le bois à mon pote Gédéon, tombé dans le
           traquenard de Long Son !
                         
          Gabriel prend un autre verre.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           A Roselito, le plus grand de tous !
                         
          Il boit.
                         
          Appuyée contre la fresque derrière le bar (la même que quinze ans
          auparavant), Georgina les regarde d'un oeil critique.
                         
                          GEORGINA
           On a le temps, messieurs ! Si ça continue, vous allez vous
           saouler...
                         
          Tous les verres sur le comptoir sont maintenant vides.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Quand on est en perm', c'est pour ça !
                         
          Gabriel s'éloigne du bar, et s'approche de la porte vitrée qui
          sépare le bar de la pièce voisine.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mais qu'est-ce que tu cherches ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Claire, elle devait me prendre à la sortie des arènes...
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mais c'est de ta faute ! Si tu buvais plus vite, elle
           serait déjà là ! Les choses entraînent les choses... Le
           bidule crée le bidule... Y a pas de hasard ! Allez ! On
           rentre à la caserne.
                         
          Il fouille dans sa poche et sort une poignée de billets froissés
          qu'il pose sur le comptoir. Gabriel revient vers lui.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Ben, permets-moi au moins de t'inviter...
                         
          Il sort de l'argent de sa poche. D'un geste, Albert l'arrête.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           T'occupe, la Bleusaille ! J'ai touché mon arriéré de
           solde... Alors, hein !
                         
          Gros plan sur le comptoir. Parmi les billets de banque, qu'Albert
          y a déposés, se trouve un billet de train.
                         
          Gabriel le prend et le regarde de plus près.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Y t'ont payé avec un billet de train...
                         
          Albert le lui prend des mains.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Tiens !...
                         
          Il le déchire en deux, et en donne la moitié à Gabriel
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Je te donne l'aller et je garde le retour... Allez, fais-en
           autant !
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           J'peux pas...
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           T'as pas confiance ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           J'ai pas de billet...
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ah ! ben alors là, t'as tort ! Faut toujours avoir un
           billet... Au cas... Tu comprends ? Au cas...
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Qu'est-ce que tu crois m'apprendre... J'ai passé ma vie à
           faire des allers et retours. Instable, on appelle ça.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Bon, ben allez, on cause de trop, on se déshydrate, hein.
           Allez, viens.
                         
          Ils se retournent et se dirigent vers la sortie. Georgina se
          penche par-dessus le bar.
                         
                          GEORGINA
           Bonsoir, et bonne rentrée.
                         
          Albert est déjà sorti, mais Gabriel se retourne vers elle.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Madame, j'ai été charmé, positivement charmé.
                         
          Il sort à son tour, d'un pas un peu hésitant.
                         
          Georgina sourit et commence à défroisser les billets laissés par
          Albert sur le comptoir.
                         
          BAR « CHINOIS » - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Albert descend lentement les marches du bar. Il fredonne « Nuits
          de Chine ».
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           La-la-la la-la nuits de Chine, nuits d'amour ! La-la-la...
                         
          Gabriel sort à son tour du bar en nouant son écharpe. Puis il
          regarde autour de lui.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Merde !
                         
          Contrechamp et plan général sur la colline et la plage en
          contrebas, plongées dans le noir.
                         
           GABRIEL FOUQUET (voix off)
           Il fait nuit, dis donc.
                         
          Retour sur Gabriel et Albert, toujours debout en bas des marches
          du bar.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ben c'est normal, c'est le changement de latitude. Allez,
           en avant !
          Plan d'ensemble de la colline avec le bar au sommet et Gabriel et
          Albert qui descendent les marches de la colline, d'un pas un peu
          hésitant.
                         
           ALBERT QUENTIN & GABRIEL FOUQUET (ensemble)
           Nuits de Chine, nuits câlines, nuits d'amour !
                         
          Ils accompagnent leur chant de grands gestes.
                         
           ALBERT QUENTIN & GABRIEL FOUQUET (ensemble)
           Nuits d'ivresse, de tendresse...
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Merde !
                         
           ALBERT QUENTIN & GABRIEL FOUQUET (ensemble)
           La-la-la... Jusqu'au lever du jour. Nuits de Chine, nuits
           câlines...
                         
          Ils sont maintenant arrivés près de la caméra en plan moyen.
          Albert s'assoit sur un banc. Il dit la dernière strophe sans
          chanter.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Nuits d'amour.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           T'as le coup de pompe ?
                         
          Du pouce, Albert montre le bar derrière lui.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Non, mais c'est l'autre vache, là, l'indigène, qui a dû me
           filer du poison.
                         
          Gabriel s'assoit à côté de lui.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           T'as peut-être plus l'habitude. Si tu veux, on peut
           rentrer.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh, hé gamin, dis donc, hé, pas de faux-fuyant. C'est pas
           parce que t'as estoqué deux ou trois voitures, mais... Moi,
           j'ai pas eu mon compte. D'abord, on va leur montrer ce
           qu'un jeune et un vieux peuvent faire.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           A qui ça ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Aux affreux ! Allez viens.
                         
          Ils se lèvent tous les deux et reprennent leur marche.
                         
           ALBERT QUENTIN & GABRIEL FOUQUET (ensemble)
           Nuits de Chine...
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - CHAMBRE ALBERT - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
          La chambre est plongée dans le noir, mais les rideaux ne sont pas
          tirés sur les fenêtres. On entend, dans la rue, Albert et Gabriel
          chanter. Leur chant est dans la continuité de celui débuté dans la
                         SCÈNE PRÉCÉDENTE
                         
                         
           ALBERT QUENTIN & GABRIEL FOUQUET (ensemble et en voix off)
           ... nuits câlines, nuits d'amour !...
                         
          Lent panoramique vers le lit, dans lequel Suzanne est assise, les
          yeux grand ouverts.
                         
           ALBERT QUENTIN & GABRIEL FOUQUET (ensemble et en voix off)
           ... Nuits d'ivresse, de tendresse... Où l'on croit aimer
           jusqu'au lever du jour...
                         
          Suzanne s'allonge dans le lit, et rabat les couvertures sur elle.
                         
           ALBERT QUENTIN & GABRIEL FOUQUET (ensemble et en voix off)
           ... Nuits de Chine, Nuits câlines...
          CAFÉ NORMAND - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Plan moyen sur le billard, où un homme en cravate et casquette est
          en train de jouer. Derrière lui, la salle et le bar, devant lequel
          deux hommes sont accoudés. Un peu plus loin le long du comptoir,
          un autre homme, assis sur un tabouret, discute avec la patronne,
          debout derrière le bar. D'autres clients sont répartis autour des
          tables de la salle. Le joueur de billard s'éloigne de la table, et
          Lucien s'approche pour jouer à son tour. Il est en chemise,
          cravate et gilet. Dans un coin, derrière lui, on découvre
          Joséphine, en train de boire, seule à une table. La porte s'ouvre.
          Albert entre précipitamment, suivi de Gabriel, qui referme la
          porte. Ils s'accoudent tous les deux au comptoir.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Deux Calvas !
                         
          En entendant la voix d'Albert, Lucien s'arrête de jouer, et se
          tourne vers le bar. Il pose sa queue sur le billard.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Sois le bienvenu, Albert.
                         
          Il redescend lentement vers le comptoir.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Je me disais toujours : ça peut pas durer, on le reverra un
           jour. Et te revoilà... comme au bon vieux temps. Tiens ! Je
           me sens vingt ans de moins.
                         
          Il est maintenant arrivé près du comptoir. Albert boit son calva
          sans se retourner. Mais Gabriel se retourne vers Lucien.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           T'es qui ?
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Oh, toi, tu ferais mieux de t'en tenir là avant que tes
           espagnolades te reprennent !
                         
          Albert et Gabriel se retournent ensemble vers Lucien. Ils ont
          l'expression un peu vague des hommes qui ont trop bu. Gabriel
          s'incline légèrement vers Lucien, et lui dit, sur un ton très
                         POSÉ :
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Monsieur Esnault, si la connerie n'est pas remboursée par
           les assurances sociales, vous finirez sur la paille.
                         
          Gabriel se retourne vers le comptoir, mais Albert continue à fixer
          Lucien d'un air sévère.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Dis donc, petit malpoli, tu veux que je t'apprenne ?
                         
          Il fait un pas vers Gabriel, qui le regarde en souriant
          niaisement, mais Albert arrête Lucien.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Monsieur Esnault, je vous interdis de tutoyer mon homme de
           barre. Je vous ai déjà dit que vous n'étiez pas de la même
           famille.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Alors, toi, je te préviens, si t'es venu pour me donner des
           ordres, je vais vous virer tous les deux à coups de pompe
           dans le train !
                         
          Albert et Gabriel se regardent.
                         
           ALBERT QUENTIN & GABRIEL FOUQUET (ensemble)
           Ohh !...
                         
          Puis Gabriel fait signe à Albert que c'est à lui « de jouer » ! Et
          Albert balance à Lucien une baffe si violente qu'il titube sous le
          choc, et s'écroule sur l'escalier. Sa femme se précipite vers lui.
                         
                          MADAME ESNAULT
           Lucien !...
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et ce n'est qu'un coup de semonce.
                         
          Madame Esnault, et d'autres clients, qui sont accourus, aident
          Lucien à se relever. Lucien, fou de colère, cherche à se dégager
          de leurs mains.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Ah ! Ah ! Laisse-le moi, hein !
                         
                          MADAME ESNAULT
           Partez, ou j'appelle les gendarmes !
                         
                          JOSÉPHINE
           Ils ont déjà eu affaire à eux ce matin. Ils n'auraient pas
           dû les relâcher !
                         
                          UN CLIENT
           Mais laisse-les donc, ils sont ronds comme des boules.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oui, messieurs, pleins comme la mer. Ensuqué à rabord ! Y a
           longtemps que vous attendiez ça, hein ? Et ben, ça y est !
           Comme ça, vous pourrez causer et égayer vos soirées
           d'hiver ! Ah !
                         
          Il se retourne vers le comptoir. Derrière eux, on voit Madame
          Esnault et les clients qui entrainent Lucien vers le fond de la
          salle.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Albert...
                         
           Hmm ?...
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Ils me font mal aux yeux, tirons-nous.
                         
          Ils finissent leurs verres.
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           T'as raison, va, on a rien à foutre chez les Français
           moyens.
                         
          Ils se dirigent lentement vers la sortie.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           On n'appartient pas au même bataillon.
                         
          Lucien, debout au milieu de la salle, entouré de ses clients, les
          regarde partir.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Et les calvas, qui c'est qui va les payer ?
                         
          Albert et Gabriel se retournent vers lui.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Adressez-vous à l'intendance. Nous, on paye plus, on ne
           connait plus, on ne salue plus.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           On méprise.
                         
          Gabriel ponctue sa dernière phrase d'un grand geste. Albert salue
          l'assistance. Gabriel ouvre la porte, et ils sortent tous les
          deux. Albert claque violemment la porte derrière lui, faisant
          tomber un thermomètre publicitaire (Picon Pikina) accroché près de
          la porte. On l'entend se briser en heurtant le sol.
                         
           LUCIEN ESNAULT (voix off)
           Bon Dieu de Bon Dieu !
                         
          TIGREVILLE - RUE HÔTEL STELLA - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Albert et Gabriel sortent du café et marchent dans la rue longeant
          l'hôtel Stella. Gabriel s'arrête devant l'hôtel.
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Albert...
                         
          Albert se retourne.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Quoi ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           J'ai peur que ta femme soit pas contente.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Parle pas de femmes en patrouille.
                         
          Il reprend sa marche un peu titubante, suivi par Gabriel.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Juste... Le vent commence à fraîchir. T'as prévu un
           mouillage ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Blangy, dans la Somme. Faut que je te présente à mon père.
          Gabriel s'arrête de marcher.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Albert...
                         
          Albert se retourne.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Qu'est-ce qu'y a encore ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Blangy, c'est pas possible.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Alors, là, tu seras porté déserteur. En opérations, tu sais
           où ça mène ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je peux pas partir d'ici... pas tout seul, tu comprends ?
           J'ai une mission.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Une mission ?... Ah, ben là, tu tombes dans ma spécialité.
           Il s'agit de quoi ?
                         
          Gabriel met un doigt sur ses lèvres.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Chhhhut !...
                         
          Il se rapproche de lui et parle plus bas.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je t'ai parlé de ma fille ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           La petite Marie ?
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           C'est ça. Et ben, elle est pas heureuse, la petite Marie.
           Et ben, faut que j'aille la chercher et que je la ramène
           avec moi.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et ben, on y va.
                         
          Il se remet en marche. On entend le son d'un poste de radio
          provenant d'une maison indéterminée.
                         
           L'ANIMATEUR DE RADIO (voix off)
           Et voici maintenant, comme chaque soir, une émission de
           Jean-Michel Audiard : « Ici l'on danse ! »...
                         
          Gabriel s'arrête au milieu de la rue.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Albert !...
                         
          Albert se retourne.
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Je peux pas y aller comme ça.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Tu peux pas, tu peux pas. Mais t'es marrant, toi. Qu'est-ce
           que ça veut dire, tu peux pas ? Hein ?
                         
          On entend un son d'accordéon provenant d'une maison, certainement
          d'un poste de radio. Les deux hommes lèvent la tête. Gabriel
          esquisse quelques pas de danse. Albert se met à danser aussi en
          chantant.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ta-la-la la-laaa...
                         
          Ils sont maintenant tous les deux en train de danser au milieu de
          la rue.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ti-la-la la-laaa... Ta-la-la la-laaa... La-la la-laaa...
           Ta-la-lala-la...
                         
          Une fenêtre s'ouvre au premier étage de la maison devant laquelle
          ils dansent, et un homme en pyjama apparaît.
                         
           LE VOISIN RONCHON
           Hé, vous allez taire vos gueules, un peu, là, oui ?
                         
          Albert et Gabriel lui font, tous les deux ensemble, un bras
          d'honneur.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ti-la-la la-laaa...
                         
          Un autre homme, en pyjama, sort d'une maison voisine.
                         
           UN AUTRE VOISIN RONCHON
           C'est tout de même malheureux de se mettre dans un état
           pareil, croyez-moi !
                         
          Pour toute réponse, Albert hausse la voix.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ti-la-la la-laaa...
                         
          Il lui fait un bras d'honneur.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           La-la la-la...
                         
          Ils s'éloignent en dansant. L'homme rentre chez lui.
                         
          COURS DILLON - PARC - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          L'imposant portail du Cours Dillon, vu de la route. On entend
          Albert chanter.
                         
           ALBERT QUENTIN (voix off)
           La-la-la la-laaa... Ti-la-la la-laaa...
          Albert et Gabriel entre dans le champ en dansant, et s'approche du
          portail.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ti-la-la la-laaa... Ti-la-la la-laaa...
                         
          Contrechamp sur Albert et Gabriel, vus à travers les barreaux de
          la grille du portail, et qui regardent à l'intérieur du parc.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Bon, ben... A première vue, les défenses ont l'air assez
           faible.
                         
          Contrechamp et plan d'ensemble de l'imposant manoir du cours
          Dillon, vu à travers les arbres du parc.
                         
          Retour sur Gabriel et Albert, toujours les mains sur les barreaux
          de la grille et regardant à l'intérieur du parc.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Alors, inutile de contourner, on va prendre ça en force.
           Allez ! Je me mets en flèche, et puis tu me files le train.
                         
          Albert a déjà saisi les barreaux, prêt à escalader le portail.
          Gabriel lui prend le bras.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Hé !... Excuse-moi, Mais c'est pas à toi de prendre les
           commandes, il s'agit tout de même de ma fille.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           D'accord... D'accord !...
                         
          Gabriel commence à escalader le portail. Albert se retourne et se
          plaque le dos contre la grille. Gabriel lui met les deux pieds sur
          les épaules.
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ohh !... Oh, ben dis donc, ben t'es un faux maigre !
                         
          Contre-plongée sur le haut du portail et Gabriel, qui a maintenant
          la tête au niveau du sommet du portail, mais qui fait face à la
          route.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           C'est peut-être que j'ai la langue chargée.
                         
          Retour sur Albert.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh !... Ben qu'est-ce tu fous ? Tourne-toi de l'autre côté,
           voyons.
                         
          Albert se dégage, et fait deux pas vers la route. Gabriel cale ses
          pieds sur une barre horizontale de la grille.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Albert !
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Quoi ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Regarde !
                         
          Albert se retourne. Zoom arrière, découvrant Gabriel accroché, les
          bras en croix, au portail.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           C'est moi, le Christ !
                         
          Le portail s'ouvre lentement, et Gabriel se retrouve accroché à la
          porte de droite.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ah !.... Ah !... Ah !...
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Hé, Albert, hé, me laisse pas ! Albert !...
                         
          Albert se précipite et Gabriel lui tombe dans les bras.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh !... Oh !...
                         
          Gabriel se rétablit sur le sol.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Oh ben, ça roupille là-dedans, dis donc... Y a une
           sonnette...
                         
          Il se tourne vers Albert.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Y a une sonnette ?
                         
          Il met un doigt sur ses lèvres, s'approche de la cloche fixée au
          portail et tire vigoureusement sur le cordon, faisant tinter la
          cloche. Puis il se dirige vers le manoir, suivi par Albert.
                         
          Comme ils s'approchent de la bâtisse, on voit deux fenêtres
          d'angle s'éclairer au premier étage.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Oh, ben, les voilà qui se réveillent, tiens !
                         
          D'autres fenêtres s'éclairent, mais au rez-de chaussée.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ah ! Enfin ! Ah ben, dis donc !
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Ah, ben voilà !
                         
          Albert se met à crier :
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Hé, branle-bas de combat, là-dedans !... Branle-bas de
           combat, je te dis, là-dedans ! Hein !
          Plan rapproché sur la porte d'entrée du manoir.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Allez, comme en 14, investissons l'ouvrage.
                         
          Il appuie très longuement sur le bouton de la sonnette.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ben alors, on se fout de nous, oui ? Mais, ma parole, c'est
           le soufflet au Sultan ! Oh, Bon Dieu !
                         
          Il donne plusieurs coups de pied dans la porte.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Si j'avais un obusier de 37, je te ferais sauter ça, et
           puis vite fait !
                         
          Gabriel, qui regarde à travers les rideaux, l'arrête de la main.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Arrête !
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Quoi ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Ils envoient un plénipotentiaire.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ah ben, c'est pas trop tôt.
                         
          La porte s'entr'ouvre, et Georgette, l'infirmière de la
          directrice, apparaît.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           C'est vous, monsieur Quentin, qui faites tout ce raffut ?
          Albert la pousse et se faufile à l'intérieur du bâtiment, suivi
          par Gabriel.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mission exceptionnelle !
                         
          COURS DILLON - HALL D'ENTRÉE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Albert et Gabriel pénètrent dans le hall, pendant que Georgette
          referme la porte.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Monsieur Quentin, j'avais cru entendre dire que vous
           poursuiviez une convalescence souhaitable. Vous devriez
           avoir honte !
                         
          Gabriel grimpe sur l'un des fauteuils de cuir, et s'assoit sur le
          dossier. Il regarde Albert en riant.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Elle croit parler à ses niards ?
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mais il a raison ! Quartier-maître Quentin, du Corps
           Expéditionnaire d'Extrême-Orient !
                         
          Le hall d'entrée, vu en plongée depuis la galerie du premier
          étage. Attiré par la grosse voix d'Albert, un homme en robe de
          chambre vient s'accouder à la balustrade. Puis deux femmes, elles
          aussi en robe de chambre, apparaissent au bas de l'escalier.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           On vient reprendre livraison de la fillette de monsieur. Et
           si elle n'est pas livrée dans les trois minutes, je ne
           réponds pas de la réaction du papa !
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Le papa ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           C'est moi.
                         
          Une jeune fille, en nattes et chemise de nuit, vient s'accouder à
          la balustrade du premier étage.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           C'est nouveau, ça !
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Pas tellement, non.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Mais vous avez pourtant dit, l'autre jour que...
                         
          Venant de sa chambre à double porte battante, la directrice vient
          d'entrer dans la pièce sur sa chaise roulante.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Attention, les minutes tournent !
                          MADAME VICTORIA
           Who are they ? What's going on ? What does this people
           want ?
           (Traduction : Qui sont-ils ? Que se passe-t-il ? Que veut
           cet individu ?)
                         
          Retour au niveau du sol. Albert écarte les bras.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ahhh !... Ben si l'Anglais est déjà dans la place, alors je
           ne m'étonne plus de rien. !
                         
                          MADAME VICTORIA
           I... I don't understand. What do you mean ?
           (Traduction : Je... je ne comprends pas. Qu'est-ce que vous
           voulez dire ?)
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Tu vas voir comment je les traite, moi, les Anglais.
                         
          Gabriel saute de son fauteuil pour arrêter Albert qui s'avance,
          l'air menaçant, vers la directrice.
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Gaspille pas tes dons. Madame est française.
                         
          Il s'assoit - normalement ! - sur le fauteuil.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Tiens donc ! Comme le colonel Lawrence était arabe !
           Perfidie légendaire ! Mais pas avec moi. Je les connais,
           moi, tous vos trucs.
                         
                          MADAME VICTORIA
           I do not share this gentleman's opinion about England. But,
           most important, first we must ascertain whether this
           gentleman is really the father of our little Marie Fouquet.
           For the moment, gentlemen, it will be best for you to go.
           We can attend everything to-morrow morning.
           (Traduction : Je ne partage pas l'opinion de ce monsieur au
           sujet de l'Angleterre. Mais, plus important, nous devons,
           en premier lieu, nous assurer que ce monsieur est vraiment
           le père de notre petite Marie Fouquet. Pour le moment,
           messieurs, il serait préférable que vous partiez. On pourra
           s'occuper de tout cela demain matin.)
                         
          La voix de la directrice se durcit soudain
                         
                          MADAME VICTORIA
           And for the child's sake, I do hope that you will be more
           presentable. Georgette, will you see them to the door,
           please.
           (Traduction : Et pour le bien-être de l'enfant, j'espère
           fortement que vous serez plus présentables. Georgette,
           voulez-vous bien les raccompagner à la porte, s'il vous
           plait.)
                         
          La directrice tourne son fauteuil et se dirige vers la double
          porte battante.
          Gabriel se tourne vers Albert.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Elle a dit : à demain.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mais c'est Fachoda !
                         
          Gabriel se lève.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Dis donc, si on envisageait un repli ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Mais pourquoi pas une retraite ?
                         
          Gabriel se dirige vers la porte. Albert reste sur place.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Moi, je trouve que c'est amener les couleurs un peu vite !
                         
          Il s'adresse à Georgette, tout en se dirigeant, lui aussi, vers la
          porte.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Estafette, faites savoir au chef de poste qu'on est
           d'accord pour remettre l'affaire à demain, mais demain
           matin, pas plus.
                         
          Il s'arrête alors qu'il est presque arrivé à la porte et se tourne
          vers Georgette.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et si, à dix heures, la fillette n'est pas à mon PC avec
           armes et bagages, et ben, vous entendrez parler des
           hussards de la mort ! Considérez ça comme un ultimatum.
                         
                          GEORGETTE
           Bien, monsieur Quentin, on transmettra.
                         
          Gabriel ouvre la porte et s'efface pour laisser passer Albert.
          Georgette les rejoint. Gabriel sort à son tour. Georgette ferme la
          porte derrière lui et donne deux tours de verrou.
                         
          COURS DILLON - PARC - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Albert et Gabriel viennent de sortir du bâtiment et se dirigent
          vers la sortie.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           T'as forcé un peu dans l'épouvante, mais t'as eu des
           moments romains.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Toujours. Quelle belle nuit, hein ?
                         
          Gabriel s'arrête.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           J'aimerais t'emmener en Andalousie, les nuits sont bleues.
          Albert se retourne.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ohh !... Mais en Chine aussi, monsieur, quand tu descends
           vers le Sud. Tu sais pas ce qu'il faudrait ?
                         
          Il tend les bras vers le ciel.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et ben, faudrait illuminer tout ça, peindre tout ça en
           rouge. Ben, on peut tout de même pas y foutre le feu...
           note bien qu'en y réfléchissant...
                         
          Gabriel se penche en avant, semblant en proie à une réflexion
          intense, un peu compliquée dans son état.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Tais-toi. Laisse-moi me rappeler... La féérie lumineuse...
           Le 14 juillet en boutique... Où est-ce que j'ai entendu ça,
           bon sang ? Parce que je l'ai entendu et vu... Si vous avez
           besoin de quoi que ce soit, je dis bien de quoi que ce
           soit... Un barbu... « Au Chic Parisien » !
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Landru !
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           C'est ça ! Il a une caisse, là, pleine de fusées, un stock
           à faire sauter Versailles.
                         
          Albert écarte les bras.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Embrasse-moi, mec !
                         
          Il le serre dans ses bras, et l'embrasse dans le cou.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Tiens, t'es mes vingt ans ! Nickelé, Champion du Monde ! On
           y va !
                         
          Ils se mettent à danser en se dirigeant vers la sortie du parc.
                         
           ALBERT QUENTIN & GABRIEL FOUQUET (ensemble)
           Ta-la-la la-la... Ta-la-la la-la...
                         
                         FONDU ENCHAINÉ
                         
          AU CHIC PARISIEN - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Les caisses de feu d'artifice sont ouvertes, et les fusées,
          qu'elles contiennent, ont certainement été répertoriées,
          puisqu'elles sont un peu en désordre. Sur un cageot, sont posées
          deux bouteilles de Beaujolais, une vide et une pleine. Les trois
          hommes sont en train de boire, Landru devant une caisse
          d'explosifs ouverte, Albert un peu en retrait derrière lui, et
          Gabriel assis sur une autre caisse. Ils reposent leurs verres.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Si vos pétards sont à la hauteur de votre Beaujolais, on va
           nous entendre du Havre !
                         
          Albert se ressert à partir de sa bouteille personnelle. Landru
          inspecte les mèches des fusées dans la caisse ouverte devant lui.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Oh-oh, pour péter, ça pètera, j'en réponds... comme de moi-
           même. Ça date pourtant de trente ans, mais inaltérable.
           Signé Ruggieri.
                         
          Il brandit deux fusées posées derrière lui. Gabriel saute de son
          perchoir.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Albert...
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Quoi ?
                         
          Gabriel soulève une caisse de fusées.
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           On pourra jamais porter ça à deux, il va falloir faire dix
           voyages, au moins.
                         
          Landru, les bras chargés de fusées, le regarde avec une certaine
          irritation.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Was ist das ? Il n'a jamais été question de jouer à ça sans
           moi, ne serait-ce que pour des raisons de survie. La
           pyrotechnie, messieurs, exige un savoir livresque et un
           tour de main absolument insoupçonnable.
                         
          Il empile son matériel dans une charrette à bras.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Bon, ben, allez, quoi, allons-y ! On n'oublie rien ?
                         
                          LANDRU
           Rien !
                         
          Il ouvre une caisse, dans laquelle il dépose les fusées qu'il
          avait en main.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Le programme est assuré. Vingt-trois marrons d'air, dix
           bombes étoilées multicolores, les éventails à surprise, dix
           phlox rotatifs, et un jardin suspendu.
                         
          Albert lève les bras vers le plafond.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Alors, là, messieurs, ça va être dantesque ! On va le
           repeindre, leur ciel !
                         
          Zoom avant sur la charrette remplie d'explosifs. On entend siffler
          une fusée.
          TIGREVILLE - RUE HÔTEL STELLA - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Contre-plongée sur le ciel au-dessus de Tigreville endormie. On
          entend siffler la fusée que l'on a déjà entendue sur l'image
          précédente, et des feux d'artifices éclatent dans le ciel.
                         
          Retour au niveau du sol. Devant l'hôtel, des touristes regardent
          le ciel, dont un officier anglais.
                         
                          L'OFFICIER ANGLAIS
           Splendid !
                         
          Nouvelle contre-plongée sur le ciel, montrant les feux d'artifices
          qui éclatent.
                         
          Autre contre-plongée au-dessus de l'hôtel Stella. Puis plusieurs
          contre-plongées en succession rapide, montrant divers angles du
          ciel entre les maison de Tigreville, tous illuminés par les feux
          d'artifice.
                         
          Plan moyen sur le Café Normand, d'où sort la patronne, enveloppée
          dans un châle blanc, suivie d'un client.
                          LE CLIENT
           Oh, merde, c'est tout de même pas le 14 juillet !
                         
          Il court vers la plage.
                         
                          MADAME ESNAULT
           Mai si, c'est bien un feu d'artifice, je le vois bien !
                         
          Tout le monde court vers la plage. Lucien sort, à son tour, du
          café et réajuste sa casquette. D'autres personnes courent dans la
          rue.
                         
          Nouvelle série de contre-plongées sur le ciel illuminé de
          Tigreville.
                         
          Retour vers Lucien, qui prend sa femme par le bras, et l'entraine
          vers la mer.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Ça vient de par là.
                         
          L'homme au béret, venant du bord de mer, rejoint Lucien et sa
          femme.
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Dis donc, y a Albert qui fait le con sur la plage avec un
           feu d'artifice. Faut voir ça.
                         
          Lucien part en courant dans le sens inverse de la mer.
                         
                          MADAME ESNAULT
           Lucien ! Fais attention ! Où vas-tu ?
                         
           L'HOMME AU BÉRET
           Là, regarde ça !
                         
          Plusieurs contre-plongées rapides sur le ciel illuminé.
          TIGREVILLE - LA GENDARMERIE - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Le brigadier Maurice et le gendarme Alexandre sortent de la
          gendarmerie et regardent vers le ciel. Tout le monde court dans la
          rue en direction de la plage.
                         
          Contre-plongée sur le ciel illuminé.
                         
          Retour au niveau du sol. Les deux gendarmes dévalent les marches
          du perron de la gendarmerie. Alexandre prend quand même le temps
          de fermer la porte.
                         
          Contre-plongée sur le ciel illuminé.

          Plan en contre plongée sur la façade de l'hôtel, montrant la
          fenêtre de la chambre d'Albert, à côté de l'enseigne. La fenêtre
          s'ouvre et Suzanne apparaît.
                         
          Contre-plongée sur le ciel illuminé.
          Plan en plongée vers la rue, comme vu de la fenêtre de la chambre
          d'Albert. Lucien arrive en courant, et lève la tête vers Suzanne.
                         
          Retour sur Suzanne, en chemise de nuit, qui regarde avec surprise
          toute l'agitation dans la rue.
                         
          Contrechamp et plan en plongée sur Lucien dans la rue.
                         
                          LUCIEN ESNAULT
           Alors, madame Quentin, il paraît qu'Albert est sur la
           plage !
                         
          Il repart en courant vers la plage.
                         
          Autre plan de la rue avec les gens qui courent vers la plage.

          Les gens arrivent, en rangs serrés, et s'accoudent à la balustrade
          qui surplombe la plage. Sur la plage, en contrebas, on distingue
          les caisses de fusées, et des hommes debout à côté.
                         
           ALBERT QUENTIN (voix off provenant de la plage)
           Voilà les Balubas qui arrivent !
                         
           DES VOIX DANS LA FOULE
           Qu'est-ce qui font ? Il est cinglé !
                         
           ALBERT QUENTIN (voix off provenant de la plage)
           Et une verte !
                         
          Plan rapproché sur Gabriel allumant une fusée avec une mèche
          d'allumage. Il se rapproche d'Albert, qui regarde vers le ciel.
          Plan rapide sur le ciel illuminé.
                         
          Retour sur la plage.
                         
          Landru allume une fusée.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Une verte maintenant, Quentin !
                         
          La fusée part.
                         
          Plan rapide sur le ciel et la fusée qui éclate.
                         
          Retour sur la plage.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Et une rouge !
                         
          Il l'allume.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et maintenant, une tricolore ! On fait plus de détail.

          Retour vers la plage.
                         
          Albert et Gabriel s'approche de deux caisses de fusées reliées
          entre elle par un circuit de mèches.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           A vous de jouer, mon cher.
                         
          Gabriel écarte les bras.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Albert, j'en ferai rien. Quand il s'agit de faire sauter la
           ville, honneur à l'autochtone.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           L'autochtone n'en fera rien, tirez le premier !
                         
          Gabriel s'exécute et allume la caisse de fusées. Les deux hommes
          s'écartent. Les fusées commencent à partir en succession rapide.
                         
          Contre champ en plan d'ensemble de la foule massée derrière la
          balustrade. Les gens s'éloignent un peu devant la quantité de

          Retour sur la foule qui applaudit.
                         
          Sur la plage, plan d'ensemble sur les trois hommes qui
          s'approchent de trois batteries de chandelles romaines.
                         
                          LANDRU
           A vos chandelles romaines !
                         
          Chaque homme est debout devant sa cible, mèche d'allumage à la
          main.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Présentez torches !
                         
          Les trois hommes lèvent les mèches au niveau de leur visage, comme
          s'ils saluaient avec un sabre de cavalerie.
                         
                          LANDRU
           A mon commandement, feu !
                         
          Chacun allume sa batterie, puis s'éloigne en courant. Les
          chandelles romaines partent en succession rapide.
          Plan général du ciel montrant les chandelles romaines qui montent.

          Retour sur la foule en délire.
                         
          Sur la plage, plan d'ensemble des trois hommes qui s'approchent de
          trois mâts, supportant des sortes d'hélices, en fait des sortes de
          roues lumineuses, qu'en pyrotechnie, on appelle des « soleils ».
                         
                          LANDRU
           A nos morts !

           A nos morts !
                         
          Ils allument chacun la base d'un mât, puis ils s'éloignent, mèche
          levée, en chantant.

          Retour sur la foule, avec les soleils au-dessus d'eux. Les deux
          gendarmes arrivent par derrière et écartent la foule.
                         
          Sur la plage, plan rapproché, en légère contre-plongée, des trois

           La Puerta del Sol !
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et la fête continue !

           Arrêtez cette plaisanterie, je vais vous coffrer, moi !

           Ils ont amené les guignols !
                         
          Contre champ sur la foule et les gendarmes.
                         
                          MAURICE
           Je vous dis d'arrêter cette plaisanterie ! Oh mais...
                         
          Retour sur les trois hommes.
                         
                          LANDRU
           La délation, messieurs, réclame un châtiment. A nous les
           explosifs !
                         
          Ils partent en courant.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Joli temps pour les artilleurs !
                         
          Albert et Landru allument plusieurs fusées en même temps.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Aimable barbiflore, passez-moi les pétards !
                         
          Landru désigne une caisse.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Là, dans la caisse. C'est dans la boite.
                         
          Gabriel se penche sur la caisse.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Puisque vous n'avez rien de mieux.
                         
                          LANDRU
           La grenade offensive n'est pas courante en mercerie.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           On va tâcher de faire avec.
                         
          Il prend des fusées dans la caisse.
                         
          Rapide plan général sur le ciel illuminé, puis retour sur la
          plage.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Qu'est-ce qu'y a là-bas dedans ?
                         
          Il désigne quelque chose du doigt.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Attention ! Ça pète !
                         
          Il désigne la foule.
                         
          Plan d'ensemble de la foule, menée par les gendarmes, et qui
          descend le long de la rampe qui mène vers la plage.
                          MAURICE
           Pour la dernière fois, je vous somme de vous arrêter !
                         
          Retour sur la plage et les trois hommes.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Gendarme, faites évacuer les femmes et les enfants, je vais
           raser le littoral !
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Nous allons rayer la Normandie de la carte ! Feu !
                         
          Il lance sa fusée.
                         
          Plan moyen de la charrette de Landru, garée au pied de la rampe
          qui descend vers la plage. La fusée de Gabriel tombe dedans et
          allume les explosifs qu'elle contient. La foule, menée par les
          gendarmes, et qui était presque arrivée au bas de la rampe,
          s'arrête net, et revient en courant vers le haut de la rampe.
          Toutes les fusées, encore contenues dans la charrette, explosent
          les unes après les autres.

          de la rampe.
                         
          Retour sur la plage et les trois hommes. Albert pointe la foule du

                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           L'ennemi est en fuite, mais maintenant une retraite
           s'impose, messieurs.
                         
                          LANDRU
           Chacun pour soi. Moi, je vais me baigner.
                         
          Il court vers la mer, une mèche d'allumage à la main.
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Qu'est-ce qu'on fait ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Descendons le Yang-Tsé-Kiang. C'est tout droit. Viens.
                         
          Ils s'éloignent en courant.

          Retour sur Albert et Gabriel qui marchent toujours sur la plage,
          s'éloignant des soleils, qui s'éteignent et s'arrêtent de tourner,
          l'un après l'autre.

          TIGREVILLE - BLOCKHAUS SUR LA PLAGE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Dans le blockhaus où Gabriel s'était réfugié pour ne pas être vu
          par Marie, Albert et Gabriel sont endormis, Albert, à moitié assis
          contre un mur, et Gabriel, allongé par terre en face de lui.
          Albert se réveille lentement.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oh !... oh !...
                         
          Gabriel se relève lentement et se met en position assise.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Vous croyez pas qu'il serait temps de rentrer.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Rentrer où ? J'ai toujours entendu dire que, dans les cas
           de reniement, on entendait le coq chanter.
                         
          Albert se met debout.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Oui, et ben, on parlera de ça plus tard, parce que j'ai un
           train à prendre.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Vous allez toujours à Blangy ?
                         
          Albert sort du blockhaus.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Hé oui, mon père a l'habitude que je sois là. Alors je
           serai là, pas brillant, mais là. Et vous, vous rentrez à
           Paris ?
                         
          Gabriel se met debout.
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           J'ai vu la mer, je ne peux pas aller plus loin.
                         
          Il sort, lui aussi, du blockhaus. Par l'ouverture, on les voit
          s'éloigner lentement tous les deux.
                         
          TIGREVILLE - PLAGE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Sur la promenade, au bord de la plage, se déroule une cérémonie
          officielle. Des soldats en uniforme français, anglais, américains,
          avec leurs drapeaux nationaux. Un officier anglais (ou
          américain ?) lit une déclaration, avec une très nette pointe
          d'accent anglais.
                         
                          OFFICIER ANGLAIS
           La France nous a toujours montré le chemin de la liberté.
                         
          Plusieurs soldats, au bord de la rambarde de pierre, se penchent
          pour regarder Albert et Gabriel, qui remontent l'escalier venant
          de la plage.
                         
                          OFFICIER ANGLAIS
           Liberté, liberté chérie, comme disait votre grand poète
           Victor Hugo. C'est au nom de cette liberté que sont tombés
           les victimes de la prodigieuse bataille dont cette petite
           plage française fut le théâtre tragique.
                         
          Albert et Gabriel sont maintenant arrivés en haut des marches, et
          s'éloignent tranquillement, sans un regard pour la cérémonie.
          L'assistance et les soldats, eux par contre, suivent les deux
          hommes du regard avec un certain intérêt. Un léger brouhaha, peu
          respectueux pour la cérémonie, s'élève d'ailleurs de la foule.
                         
                          OFFICIER ANGLAIS
           Tragique, mais glorieux. Qu'il me soit permis de remercier
           plus particulièrement cette année monsieur le maire et
           messieurs les conseillers municipaux pour le magnifique feu
           d'artifice...
                         
          Plan moyen d'Albert et Gabriel longeant la rangée de cabines de
          plage, d'un pas tranquille et un peu trainant.
                         
           OFFICIER ANGLAIS (voix off)
           ... qui a donné à notre pieuse réunion un éclat dont nous
           nous inspirerons désormais. C'est pourquoi je crie, du fond
           du coeur : Vive les États-Unis, Vive l'Angleterre, Vive la
           France !
                         
          HOTEL STELLA - VESTIBULE DE RÉCEPTION - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Marie Fouquet est assise sur une chaise en face du bureau de
          réception, une valise posée à côté d'elle. Elle n'est plus en
          uniforme, mais, par contre, elle porte le pull-over que lui a
          offert son papa. Elle feuillète un magazine. La porte s'ouvre
          lentement. Albert entre, suivi de Gabriel. Marie se lève.
                         
                          MARIE FOUQUET
           Papa ! Que je suis contente !
                         
          Elle monte debout sur la chaise pour embrasser son père. Albert
          referme la porte. Debout sur les premières marches de l'escalier,
          Suzanne regarde son mari.
                         
                          MARIE FOUQUET
           Alors, c'est vrai que tu m'emmènes ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Mais bien sûr que te t'emmène.
                         
          Elle l'embrasse encore, puis se frotte la joue.
                         
                          MARIE FOUQUET
           Dis donc, tu piques !
                         
          Albert se rapproche de Suzanne.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Alors, moi, personne m'embrasse, mais je pique aussi. Je
           vais me raser.
                         
          Il monte deux marches et s'arrête au niveau de Suzanne.
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Euh... bon... ben... Boh, euh... Je prendrai le train de
           quinze heures, quoi.
                         
          Derrière eux, Gabriel est en train d'aider Marie à remettre son
          manteau.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Je savais pas à quelle heure tu rentrerais, j'ai fait
           remonter ta valise, c'est idiot.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ben oui, oh...
                         
          Il monte l'escalier et passe devant Suzanne qui ne bouge pas, mais
          se retourne pour le suivre des yeux.
                         
          DEAUVILLE - PLACE DE LA GARE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Plan moyen de la DS break d'Albert sur le parking de la gare. Il y
          a des valises sur le toit. La porte arrière droite s'ouvre, et
          Gabriel sort, suivi de Marie. Devant eux, Albert sort aussi de la
          voiture. Il porte un manteau et un chapeau, prêt pour une visite
          au cimetière de son père. Gabriel et Albert récupèrent chacun
          leurs valises sur le toit, deux pour Gabriel, et une pour Albert.
          Suzanne, qui était au volant, fait le tour de la voiture. Marie
          s'approche d'elle.
                         
                          MARIE FOUQUET
           Au revoir, madame Quentin.
                         
          Elle lui serre la main.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Au revoir, ma petite Marie.
                         
          Elle se penche et l'embrasse. Gabriel pose une de ses valises, et
          tend la main à Suzanne
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Au revoir, madame, merci pour tout.
                         
          Ils se serrent la main. Gabriel se penche, récupère sa valise et
          s'éloigne avec Marie, qui lui prend la main. Suzanne et Albert se
          regardent.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Je t'attends mardi au train de six heures ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ben, bien sûr.
                         
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           T'oubliera pas ton changement à Lisieux ?
                         
          Quelques mètres plus loin, Gabriel a posé ses deux valises en
          attendant Albert.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Tss-tss !... N'aie pas peur.
                          SUZANNE QUENTIN
           Oh, j'ai pas peur. Je regrette que la petite Marie n'ait
           pas vu le feu d'artifice. C'était formidable.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ils sont pas prêts d'en revoir un comme ça, va. Allez, au
           revoir.
                         
          Ils s'embrassent sur les deux joues. Gabriel a récupéré ses
          valises. Albert le rejoint.
                         
          Travelling arrière sur les trois voyageurs qui marchent vers la
          gare, Marie entre les deux hommes. Elle donne la main à son père,
          et timidement, elle tend la main à Albert, qui lui donne la main.
          Derrière eux, Suzanne les regardent s'éloigner. Albert se penche
          et regarde Marie en souriant.

          TRAIN - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Plan moyen du compartiment, où ils ne sont que tous les trois,
          Albert et Marie à côté de la vitre, et Gabriel à côté de Marie.
          Marie craque une allumette pour la cigarette de son père. Gabriel
          se penche sur l'allumette pour allumer sa cigarette. Marie souffle
          l'allumette et la jette dans le cendrier sous la vitre. Marie
          regarde Albert.
                         
                          MARIE FOUQUET
           C'est où que tu changes de train ?
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ben, ça va pas tarder.
                         
                          MARIE FOUQUET
           T'as pas le temps de me raconter une autre histoire ? Juste
           une.
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ben, si tu veux, mais alors, c'est la dernière. Et puis
           elle est vraie, celle-là.
                         
          Il se penche en avant.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Alors, écoute. En Chine, quand les grands froids arrivent,
           dans toutes les rues des villes, on trouve des tas de
           petits singes égarés sans père, ni mère. On sait pas s'ils
           sont venus là par curiosité ou bien par peur de l'hiver,
           mais, comme tous les gens là-bas croient que même les
           singes ont une âme, ils donnent tout ce qu'ils ont pour
           qu'on les ramène dans leurs forêts, pour qu'ils retrouvent
           leurs habitudes, leurs amis.
                         
          Si Marie semble très attentive à l'histoire d'Albert, Gabriel,
          lui, sourit.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Et c'est pour ça qu'on voit des trains pleins de petits
           singes qui remontent vers la jungle.
                         
          Albert se cale dans son siège.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Ah, on arrive.
                         
          Par la vitre du compartiment, on voit un homme qui passe dans le
          couloir, une valise à la main.
                         
          Marie le regarde passer. Albert remet son chapeau, et se lève. Il
          se penche sur Marie, qui se lève.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Allez, au revoir, ma belle.
                         
          Ils s'embrassent. Gabriel se lève pour l'aider à attraper sa
          valise sur l'étagère au-dessus des sièges.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Non, non, ne vous dérangez pas.
                         
          Il descend sa valise et la pose sur le siège.
                         
                          ALBERT QUENTIN
           Allez, au revoir.
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Au revoir.
                         
          Gabriel se lève légèrement. Les deux hommes se serrent la main.
                         
          Gabriel se rassoit. Albert sort dans le couloir.

          Plan d'ensemble du quai, en travelling avant, comme si la caméra
          était posée sur la locomotive, dont on voit l'avant en premier
          plan. Le train venant de Deauville entre en gare, puis il
          s'arrête.

          apparaît à côté de lui. On voit Albert qui descend du train. Il ne
          se retourne pas vers Gabriel et Marie.
                         
                          MARIE FOUQUET
           Dis, papa, tu crois qu'il en a vu, des singes en hiver ?
                         
                          GABRIEL FOUQUET
           Je pense qu'il en a vu au moins un.
                         
           ANNONCE (voix off sortant d'un haut-parleur)
           Lisieux. Les voyageurs pour Rouen, Azincourt (?), Blangy
           changent de train. Correspondance sur le même quai. Départ
           à dix heures...
                         
          Albert s'assoit sur un banc, tournant le dos au train qu'il vient
          de quitter. Il pose sa valise à côté de lui. Il enlève son
          chapeau, qu'il pose sur le banc, met les mains dans ses poches, et
          sort un bonbon de l'une d'entre elles. Il enlève lentement
          l'enveloppe protectrice, sort le bonbon et le met dans sa bouche.
          Derrière lui, le train redémarre. Gabriel et Marie sont toujours à
          la fenêtre de leur compartiment. Ils regardent Albert, qui, lui,
          ne tourne pas la tête pour les regarder.
                         
          Travelling en légère plongée. On a l'impression que la caméra est
          installée dans le compartiment de Gabriel. Sur le quai, Albert ne
          bouge pas, environnée par la fumée provenant de la locomotive. On
          passe devant Albert et la caméra pivote pour rester pointée sur
          lui. Puis on le voit s'éloigner lentement, toujours assis sur son
          banc.
                         
          Sur l'écran, apparaît en lettres majuscules blanches :
                         
           ... Et le vieil homme
           entra dans un long hiver...
                         
          Le texte disparaît, puis fondu au noir.

          INT. MOVIE THEATRE - CONTINUOUS

          Of everyone watching in the modest, small town theater, no
          one is more enthralled than 8 year old CARL FREDRICKSEN.

          

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                    This lighter-than-air craft was
                    designed by Muntz himself, and is
                    longer than 22 Prohibition paddy-
                    wagons placed end to end.

          Young Carl stares, mouth agape, wearing leather flight helmet
          and goggles -- just like his idol on the silver screen.

          

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    And here comes the adventurer now!

          

                                                                     2.

          

          
          NEWSREEL FOOTAGE: the dashing Muntz descends down the
          gangplank to the delight of the crowd. His dogs trail him.

          

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    Never apart from his faithful dogs,
                    Muntz conceived the craft for
                    canine comfort! It's a veritable
                    floating palace in the sky...

          
          An opulent dining room.

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    ...complete with doggie bath and
                    mechanical canine walker.

          
          One dog runs suffers through mechanized bath time, while a
          second wears an electrode helmet and runs on a treadmill.

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    And Jiminy Cricket, do the locals
                    consider Muntz the bee's knees!
                    And how!

          
          Cameras flash as Muntz stands heroic, striking his signature
          "thumbs up" stance.

                              MUNTZ
                    "Adventure is out there!"

          In the theater, Young Carl returns the thumbs up.

                               NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    But what has Muntz brought back
                    this time?

          
          Muntz speaks to a crowded auditorium, on stage beside a
          curtained object.

                              MUNTZ
                    Gentlemen, I give you: the Monster
                    of Paradise Falls!

          He pulls away the drape to reveal a GIANT BIRD SKELETON.

          

                              CROWD
                    Ooh!
          Young Carl leans forward, eyes bulging.

          

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    And golly, what a swell monster
                    this is. But what's this?

          Skeptical scientists analyze the bones.

          

                                                                        3.

          

          

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    Scientists cry foul! The National
                    Explorers Society accuses Muntz of
                    fabricating the skeleton!

          

                                 YOUNG CARL
                    No!

          
          Muntz's portrait is removed from a wall of paintings of other
          famous explorers.

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    The organization strips Muntz of
                    his membership.

          
          Muntz's "Explorer's Society" badge is ceremoniously RIPPED
          from his jacket.
          Carl GASPS.

          
          Muntz stands next to his dirigible at an airfield.       He grimly
          addresses the crowd.

          

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    Humiliated, Muntz vows a return to
                    Paradise Falls and promises to
                    capture the beast... alive!

          

                              MUNTZ
                    I promise to capture the beast...
                    alive!

          
          In the theater, young Carl smiles.

                              MUNTZ
                    And I will not come back until I do!
          The crowd CHEERS.

          
          Muntz gives his thumbs up from the cockpit as the dirigible
          lifts off.

                                 NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    And so the    explorer is off to clear
                    his name.     Bon voyage Charles
                    Muntz, and    good luck capturing the
                    Monster of    Paradise Falls!
          Carl looks like he just witnessed a miracle.

          

                                                             DISSOLVE TO:

          Young Carl "flies" his blue balloon ("The Spirit of
          Adventure" hand-written on it) as he runs along the sidewalk.
          He still wears helmet and goggles.

                    "Adventure is out there!"
          Carl stops.   Who said that?

          
          The voice comes from a dilapidated HOUSE, windows boarded up
          and lawn overgrown with weeds.
          The weather vane atop the house turns, pulled by ropes.

          

                              GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Look out! Mount Rushmore! Hard to
                    starboard. Must get the Spirit of
                    Adventure over Mount Rushmore...

          

                                                                       5.

          

          
          Carl walks toward the voice.

          

                              GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hold together old girl. How're my
                    dogs doing? Ruff ruff!

          

          INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          Carl squeezes through the broken door into the foyer.   He
          follows the voice toward the living room.

          

                              GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    All engines ahead full! Let's take
                    her up to 26,000 feet! Rudders
                    eighteen degrees towards the south.

          

          INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS


          
          Carl rounds the corner to see...

          
          ELLIE, an eight year old girl, her mussy red hair barely
          visible beneath her flight helmet and goggles. Bare footed,
          her overalls are patched and dirty.
          The old house has been transformed into a make-believe
          dirigible cockpit. Ellie steers, the wheel made from a rusty
          old bicycle.

          

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    It's a beautiful day, winds out of
                    the east at ten knots.
                    Visibility... unlimited.
                        (yells a command)
                    Enter the weather in the logbook!
          The navigator (her hamster) skitters in its cage.

          
          Ellie uses two tied-together Coke bottles as binoculars.

          

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    Oh! There's something down there!
                    I will bring it back for science.
                    Awwww, it's a puppy!

          
          Carl is distracted by the Muntz newspaper clippings taped to
          the wall.

          

                               YOUNG ELLIE (O.S.)
                    No time!   A storm! Lightning! Hail!
          Ellie pops up in front of Carl.

          

                                                                    6.

          

          

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    What are you doing!?!

          
          Carl screams. He lets go of his balloon. It floats through
          a broken part of the ceiling and disappears.
          Ellie circles Carl accusingly.

          

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    Don't you know this is an exclusive
                    club? Only explorers get in here.
                    Not just any kid off the street
                    with a helmet and a pair of
                    goggles. Do you think you got what
                    it takes? Well, do you?!?

          
          Carl FUMPHERS.

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    Alright, you're in. Welcome aboard.
          She offers her hand.   Carl looks down, embarrassed.

          

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    What's wrong? Can't you talk?
          Carl is frozen.   Ellie softens.

          

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    Hey, I don't bite.
          She takes off her helmet.   Her hair frizzes out in all
          directions.
          She removes a homemade GRAPE SODA CAP pin from her shirt and
          pins it on Carl.

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    You and me, we're in a club now.

          
          Carl smiles.

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    I saw where your balloon went.
                    Come on, let's go get it!

          
          Carl watches her stride out of the room.   She pops back in.

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    My name's Ellie.

          
          She grabs his hand.
          Carl blushes as she pulls him out of the room.

          

                                                                     7.

          

          

          

          INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE, UPSTAIRS


          

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       There it is.

          
          Carl and Ellie look across the attic at the balloon. Between
          them the floor has collapsed, save one rickety beam. Carl GULPS.

          

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       Well, go ahead.
          She pushes him out onto the beam.

                                    YOUNG ELLIE
                       Go on.

          
          Carl steels his courage. He puts on his goggles, starts
          forward... and FALLS through the floor.

                                                            CUT TO:

          

          

          EXT. SMALL TOWN NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY

          Ambulance.    SIREN blaring.

          

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          One lone light on upstairs.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S ROOM

          Carl in bed, reading a book by flashlight, his arm in a CAST.

          
          Into the room floats Carl's lost BLUE BALLOON.
          Carl jumps and CALLS OUT in fright.

          

                                    YOUNG CARL
                              (re: arm)
                       Ow!

          
          A head pops up from outside the open window.

          

                                    YOUNG ELLIE
                       Hey kid!!

          
          Carl SCREAMS, hitting himself in the face with the cast.

          

                                    YOUNG CARL
                       Ow!!

          

                                                                    8.

          

          
          Ellie climbs in the window.

          

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       Thought you might need a little
                       cheerin' up. I got somethin' to
                       show ya!

          

          INT. CARL'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER


          
          The two hunker under a blanket tent with a flashlight.   Ellie
          whispers, as if to protect a National Secret.

          

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       I am about to let you see something
                       I have never shown to another human
                       being. Ever. In my life.
          Carl's eyes widen in alarm.

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       You'll have to swear you will not
                       tell anyone.
          Carl nods.

          

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       Cross your heart. Do it!
          Carl crosses.    Ellie unveils...

          

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       My Adventure Book!
          It's a reused photo album with the words "My Adventure Book"
          written across it. She opens it to a photo of Charles Muntz.

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       You know him.
          Carl smiles excitedly.

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       Charles Muntz, explorer. When I get
                       big, I'm going where he's going:
                       South America.
          She turns the page to a map.

          

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       It's like America... but south.
                       Wanna know where I'm gonna live?

          

                                                                   9.

          

          
          She turns to an engraving of a large waterfall. A small hand-
          drawn picture of Ellie's clubhouse is glued to the top.

          

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                           (reading caption)
                       "Paradise Falls, a land lost in
                       time." I ripped this right out of
                       a library book.

          
          Carl GASPS in horror.

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       I'm gonna move my clubhouse there,
                       and park it right next to the
                       falls. Who knows what lives up
                       there? And once I get there...

          
          She flips through her book, revealing a page marked, "STUFF
          I'M GOING TO DO." Past that, the pages are blank.

          

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       Well, I'm saving these pages for
                       all the adventures I'm gonna have.
                       Only... I just don't know how I'm
                       gonna get to Paradise Falls.
          Ellie closes the book, disappointed.

          
          Carl has a thought.    He looks at his toy dirigible.

          

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       That's it! You can take us there
                       in a blimp! Swear you'll take us.
                       Cross your heart! Cross it! Cross
                       your heart.

          
          Carl does.

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       Good. You promised. No backing out.

          
          Carl shakes his head "no."

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       Well, see you tomorrow kid!   Bye.

          
          Ellie hops up and jumps out the window.

                                YOUNG ELLIE
                       "Adventure is out there!!"

          
          She pops back in.

          

                                                                    10.

          

          

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    You know, you don't talk very much.
                    I like you.

          
          Carl looks out the window after her in amazement.   He rests
          his head on his balloon.

          

                              YOUNG CARL
                    Wow.

          
          The balloon pops.

          

                                                              CUT TO:

          

          INT. CHURCH - DAY


          
          FLASH! A photo is taken of the wedding couple: Carl and
          Ellie, now 19. She jumps at him and gives him a big kiss.

          
          Ellie's side of the church erupts like wild frontiersmen.     A
          gun shot is fired in the air.

          
          Carl's side, rigid puritans in black, clap politely.

          

          EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY


          
          Carl carries her past a "SOLD" sign.   It's the same house
          where they met as kids.

          

          

          EXT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE - DAY

          Still in their wedding clothes: She saws as he hammers.

          

          INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY


          
          They push two chairs into place side by side in the living room.

          

          EXT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE - DAY


          
          Ellie finishes painting "Carl & Ellie" on their MAILBOX.
          Carl leans in to admire her work but leaves a messy paint
          handprint on the mailbox! Oh well; Ellie adds her handprint
          as well. They smile.

          

          

          EXT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE - DAY

          Their house now matches Ellie's colorful CLUB HOUSE DRAWING
          from her childhood Adventure Book.

          

                                                                   11.

          

          

          

          EXT. RURAL HILLSIDE - DAY


          
          They run up a hillside together.

          
          They lie side by side on a picnic blanket. She describes the
          clouds. He watches as a cloud transforms into a turtle.

          
          Carl closes his eyes and smiles.   He's lucky to be with her.

          

          EXT. ZOO - DAY


          
          Ellie emerges from the South America House, dressed in her
          Zookeeper's uniform.

          
          Carl shows off his new BALLOON CART and uniform. Behind him
          the balloons lift his cart off the ground. Carl jumps to
          catch it. She giggles.

          

          INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY


          
          Carl and Ellie sit side by side in their chairs, reading.
          Without looking up from their books, they hold hands.

          

          EXT. RURAL HILLSIDE - DAY


          
          Again at their picnic spot, they watch clouds. Ellie sees an
          elephant with wings. Carl gives it a try and points out a
          BABY. Ellie lights up, excited. She sees ALL the clouds as
          babies! Carl is stunned... but smiles.

          

          

          INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, BABY ROOM - DAY


          
          Ellie finishes painting a wall mural of a stork carrying a
          bundle in its beak. Carl hangs a mobile above the crib.

          

          

          INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

          Carl touches Ellie's shoulder as the doctor explains.   Ellie
          drops her head in her hands.

          

          

          EXT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

          Carl looks out the window.   Ellie sits alone under a tree,
          the wind in her hair.

          

                                                                    12.

          

          

          

          EXT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, YARD - AFTERNOON


          
          Carl joins Ellie.   He hands her the Adventure Book. She smiles.

          

          INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON


          
          Ellie paints a MURAL of their house atop Paradise Falls over
          the mantle. Carl organizes a compass, map, binoculars, and
          native bird figurine beneath the painting. It's their shrine
          to Adventure.

          

          INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON


          
          Carl sets A JAR on a table, "PARADISE FALLS" written on it.
          Ellie drops in a few coins. She looks at Carl and crosses
          her heart. Carl crosses his.

          

          A SERIES OF SHOTS

          
          The jar slowly fills as Carl and Ellie toss in spare change.
          Their car blows a tire.
          The two stand by the jar, reluctant.   Carl BREAKS the jar.

          
          New tire.

          
          Carl in the hospital with a broken leg.

          
          Breaking jar.
          A storm rages.   A tree falls, crushing the roof.

          
          Breaking jar.

          

          INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - MORNING


          
          Carl struggles to tie his tie.   Ellie helps.   They walk out
          the front door arm in arm.

          

          

          INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - 3 YEARS LATER

          Ellie struggles to tie Carl's tie as they rush out the door.

          
          A SERIES OF SHOTS as Ellie straightens Carl's ties.    Stylish
          1950's ties. Wide 60's ties. Paisley 70's ties.

          

                                                                      13.

          

          

          

          INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - 30 YEARS LATER


          
          Older Carl and Ellie smile at themselves in the hall mirror.

          

          EXT. ZOO - DAY


          
          Carl in his 60's. They still work happily side by side at
          the zoo. Carl's cart lifts off the ground. He casually
          leans an elbow on it.

          

          INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Carl and Ellie dance in the evening candlelight. The
          PARADISE FALLS JAR sits off to the side, now dusty and
          forgotten.

          

          INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM WINDOW - AFTERNOON

          Carl cleans the inside of the window.    Ellie cleans the
          outside.

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON


          
          Carl vacuums the Adventure Shrine on the mantle. Carl smiles
          at a photo of Ellie as a child, wearing her flight helmet and
          goggles. He looks up at the mural of their house at Paradise
          Falls. His smile fades.

          
          Behind him, Ellie sweeps the floor.    Their dream has gone
          unfulfilled.

          
          Carl has an idea.

          

          EXT. TRAVEL AGENCY - DAY


          
          Carl buys two tickets to South America.

          

          EXT. RURAL HILLSIDE - AFTERNOON


          
          Carl hurries excitedly up picnic hill.    He hides the airline
          tickets in his basket.
          Behind him, Ellie falters and falls.    She tries to get up but
          falls again. Something is wrong.

          
          He runs to her.

          

                                                                    14.

          

          

          

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY


          
          Ellie lies in a hospital bed.    She looks through her

          ADVENTURE BOOK.

          
          A BLUE BALLOON floats in to the room.

          
          Carl stands at the door.   He smiles and walks to her bedside.

          
          Ellie pushes her Adventure Book toward him.    She weakly pats
          his cheek and adjusts his tie.

          
          He kisses her on the forehead.

          

          INT. CHURCH - AFTERNOON


          
          Carl sits alone, next to a huge bouquet of balloons.

          

          EXT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE - DUSK


          
          Carl walks into the house, holding a single blue balloon.

                                                        FADE TO BLACK.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S BEDROOM - MORNING - SEVERAL YEARS LATER

          An ALARM CLOCK BUZZES.    An aged hand shuts it off and picks
          up the nearby glasses.

          
          CARL sits alone in his double bed.   He rubs his face. GRUNTS.
          He gets out of bed, STRETCHING, GRUNTING and CRACKING BONES.

          
          He grabs his cane, with four tennis balls stuck to the bottom
          spokes.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S STAIRCASE - LATER

          Now dressed, Carl rides his ELDERLY ASSISTANCE CHAIR down the
          staircase. This takes a LONG, LONG time.

          
          Three quarters of the way down, the chair stops.    He bangs
          the armrest and the chair restarts.

          

          INT. CARL'S KITCHEN - LATER


          
          Carl eats breakfast by himself.

          

                                                                      15.

          

          

          

          INT. CARL'S LIVING ROOM WINDOW - LATER


          
          Carl cleans the window with a cloth.    His lonely reflection
          stares back at him.

          

          INT. CARL'S LIVING ROOM - LATER


          
          Carl dusts the mantle and Shrine to Adventure.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - LATER

          Carl looks in the hall mirror. He puts on his hat and
          considers his reflection. He straightens his GRAPE SODA PIN.

          

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - CONTINUOUS

          Many LOCKS are heard unlocking from inside.
          The door opens, but bangs against the safety chain.      Carl
          GRUMBLES in frustration.
          Carl opens the door, walks out onto his porch, pulls the door
          shut, and looks as if he's about to go somewhere.

          
          He sits in his porch chair.

          

          EXT. CARL'S NEIGHBORHOOD - CONTINUOUS


          
          Carl's house is the lone surviving square on the block not
          under construction. Machinery and workers circle busily.
          High rise buildings are being erected all around.

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - MORNING


          
          Carl looks at the activity around him.

          

                              CARL
                    Quite a sight, huh Ellie?
                        (noticing mailbox)
                    Uhp, mail's here.

          
          Carl walks to the mailbox.    He touches Ellie's faded
          HANDPRINT and smiles.

          
          He looks through the mail.

          
          He sees a SHADY OAKS RETIREMENT VILLAGE pamphlet full of
          images of happy old people. Carl scoffs.

          

                                                                   16.

          

          

                              CARL
                    Shady Oaks Retirement.    Oh brother.

          
          Carl notices DUST on his mailbox.

          

                              CARL
                    Hm.

          
          He pulls up a LEAF BLOWER.   He revs it and blasts off the dust.

          
          TOM, the CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN, notices.

          

                              CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
                    Hey! `Morning, Mr. Fredricksen!
                    Need any help there?

          

                              CARL
                    No. Yes. Tell your boss over there
                    that you boys are ruining our house.

          
          He points across the lot to a business man in a suit talking
          on a cell phone - the REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER.

          

                              CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
                    Well just to let you know, my boss
                    would be happy to take this old
                    place off your hands, and for
                    double his last offer. Whaddya say
                    to that?
          The leaf blower blasts off his hat.

          

                              CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
                    Uh, I take that as a no, then.

                              CARL
                    I believe I made my position to
                    your boss quite clear.

                              CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
                    You poured prune juice in his gas tank.

          

                              CARL
                    Oh yeah, that was good. Here, let
                    me talk to him.

          
          Tom hands Carl his MEGAPHONE.

          

                              CARL
                        (in megaphone)
                    You in the suit. Yes, you.      Take a
                    bath, hippy!

          
          Tom grabs the megaphone.

          

                                                                  17.

          

          

                              CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
                        (to Boss, re Carl)
                    I am not with him!
                        (to Carl)
                    This is serious. He's out to get
                    your house!

          
          Carl walks to his front door.

          

                              CARL
                    Tell your boss he can have our house.

          

                                 CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
                    Really?

          

                              CARL
                    When I'm dead!
          Carl SLAMS the door.

                              CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
                    I'll take that as a maybe!

          

          INT. CARL'S LIVING ROOM - DAY - LATER


          
          Carl sits in his chair watching TV.

          
          A KNOCK at the door.

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - DAY


          
          The door opens.
          A Wilderness Explorer stands, reading from a Wilderness
          Explorer Manual. He is in uniform, complete with sash,
          neckerchief, hat, and an enormous backpack stuffed with every
          piece of equipment there is. This is RUSSELL, age 8.
          Russell, nose buried in his MANUAL, reads to Carl.

                              RUSSELL
                    "Good afternoon. My name is
                    Russell. And I am a Wilderness
                    Explorer in Tribe 54, Sweatlodge
                    12. Are you in need of any
                    assistance today, sir?"

          
          As he finishes the script, Russell smiles up at Carl.

          

                                 CARL
                    No.

          

                                                                   18.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    I could help you cross the street.

          

                               CARL
                    No.

                              RUSSELL
                    I could help you cross your yard.

          

                               CARL
                    No.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    I could help you cross your... porch?

          

                               CARL
                    No.

                               RUSSELL
                    Well, I gotta help you cross
                    something.

          

                               CARL
                    Uh, no.   I'm doing fine.

          
          Carl closes the door in Russell's face.

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - CONTINUOUS


          
          Carl listens through the door. Is the kid gone?   He opens it.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    "Good afternoon. My name is
                    Russell."

          

                              CARL
                    Uh... kid...

          

                              RUSSELL
                    "And I am a Wilderness Explorer in
                    Tribe 54, Sweatlodge 12."

                               CARL
                    Kid.   KID!!

          
          Russell stops... but goes back to reading.

                              RUSSELL
                    "Are you in need of any assistance
                    today Sir?"

                              CARL
                    Thank you, but I don't need any help!

          

                                                                     19.

          

          
          Carl swings the door shut, but a small camping boot stops it.

          

                                 RUSSELL
                    Ow.

          
          Carl opens the door.    Russell stands at attention.

          

                              CARL

                        (RESIGNED)
                    Proceed.

                              RUSSELL
                    "Good afternoon. My-"

                              CARL
                    But skip to the end!

          
          Russell points to his SASH. It is covered with badges except
          for one glaringly empty space.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    See these? These are my Wilderness
                    Explorer badges. You may notice
                    one is missing. It's my Assisting
                    the Elderly badge. If I get it I
                    will become a Senior Wilderness
                    Explorer!
          Russell makes the Explorer Sign: his thumbs form a "W", his
          fingers the "wings" of a bird, then the "claws" of a bear.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    "The wilderness must be explored!

                    CAW-CAW! RAAAR!"

          
          This sets Carl's hearing aid off. Carl GRUMBLES in pain.

                              RUSSELL
                    It's gonna be great! There's a big
                    ceremony, and all the dads come,
                    and they pin on our badges...

                              CARL
                    So you want to assist an old
                    person?

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Yep! Then I will be a Senior
                    Wilderness Explorer!
          Carl leans in close to Russell.

          

                                                                  20.

          

          

                              CARL

                        (CONSPIRATORIALLY)
                    You ever heard of a snipe?

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Snipe?

          

                              CARL
                    Bird. Beady eyes. Every night it
                    sneaks in my yard and gobbles my
                    poor azaleas. I'm elderly and
                    infirm. I can't catch it. If only
                    someone could help me...

                               RUSSELL
                    Me! Me!   I'll do it!

          

                              CARL
                    Oh, I don't know, it's awfully
                    crafty. You'd have to clap your
                    hands three times to lure it in.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    I'll find it, Mr. Fredricksen!

          

                              CARL
                    I think its burrow is two blocks
                    down. If you go past --

                              RUSSELL
                    Two blocks down! Got it!

          
          Russell runs down the block clapping and calling.

                              RUSSELL
                    Sniiiipe! Here Snipey Snipey...

                              CARL
                        (calls after Russell)
                    Bring it back here when you find
                    it!
          Carl rolls his eyes and begins to close his door.

          
          He stops short.

          
          A large truck is backing up, getting dangerously close to

          ELLIE'S MAILBOX.

          

                              CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE
                    Okay, keep her coming... And...
                    stop. Stop! STOP!!
          The truck hits Ellie's mailbox, crushing the front.

          

                                                                      21.

          

          
          Carl is shocked.   He runs to the box.

          

                              CARL
                    What? Hey! Hey you!         What do you
                    think you're doing?

                              CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE
                    I am so sorry, sir...

          
          The worker bangs on the mailbox, trying to fix it.

                              CARL
                    Don't touch that!

                              CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE
                    No no, let me take care of that for you.

          
          Carl grabs the mailbox, trying to wrestle it from the worker.

                              CARL

                        (STRUGGLING)
                    Get away from our mailbox!

          

                              CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE
                    Hey sir, I...

                              CARL
                    I don't want you to touch it!
          Carl HITS the worker with his cane.      He falls to the sidewalk.
          The worker rubs his head.    Blood.

          
          Carl backs up toward his door, cradling his mailbox.     What
          has he done?

          
          Passerbys stare.
          Workers gather, as does the REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER.

          
          Carl backs into his house.

          

          INT. CARL'S LIVING ROOM


          
          Carl shuts his door.   He closes the curtains.
          He peeks out the window. The injured worker is helped to his
          feet. A police car pulls up.

          
          The Real Estate Developer looks toward Carl's house.     His
          hand rests on Carl's fence.

          

                                                                     22.

          

          

          

          INT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - DAY


          
          Carl sits alone on a bench holding a Court Summons.

          

          INT. COURTROOM - DAY


          
          A GUARD opens the door. Carl enters.    The REAL ESTATE
          DEVELOPER watches him enter.

          

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE - LATE EVENING

          A Police Officer drops Carl at his front gate.

          

                               OFFICER EDITH
                    Sorry Mr. Fredricksen. You don't
                    seem like a public menace to me.
                    Take this.

          
          She hands him a pamphlet for SHADY OAKS RETIREMENT VILLAGE.

          

                              OFFICER EDITH
                    The guys from Shady Oaks will be by
                    to pick you up in the morning, okay?
          The officer drives off, leaving Carl alone.

          
          Carl faces the house.    He touches Ellie's dented mailbox.

          

                              CARL
                    What do I do now, Ellie?

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - NIGHT


          
          All is quiet but the slow ticking of the clock.
          The empty hall.

          
          The front hall mirror.
          The kitchen.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, CLOSET

          Carl pulls out a suitcase.   A book tips over.   Ellie's
          Adventure Book.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM

          Carl sits in his chair slowly paging through the book.

          

                                                                       23.

          

          
          He turns to the page marked "STUFF I'M GOING TO DO."    He
          closes the book and sighs.

          
          Carl looks at the Adventure Shrine, and the PAINTING of their
          house by Paradise Falls.
          He holds the Shady Oaks pamphlet.

          
          Carl's brows furrow.    He looks up at the shrine, and crosses
          his heart.

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Lights are on inside the house.

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE - MORNING


          
          A SHADY OAKS RETIREMENT VILLAGE van pulls up.
          Nurses GEORGE and A.J. walk to Carl's door and KNOCK.
          Carl answers, holding a suitcase.

          

                              CARL
                    Morning gentlemen.

                              NURSE GEORGE
                    Good morning, Mr. Fredricksen.    You
                    ready to go?

          

                               CARL
                    Ready as I'll ever be. Would you
                    do me a favor and take this?

          
          Carl hands over his suitcase.

          

                              CARL
                    I'll meet you at the van in just a
                    minute. I... want to say one last
                    goodbye to the old place.

          

                               NURSE GEORGE
                    Sure.   Take all the time you need, sir.

          
          Carl closes the door.   Rather sharply.   The nurses head back
          to the van.

          

                                                                     24.

          

          

                                NURSE A.J.
                      Typical. He's probably going to the
                      bathroom for the eightieth time.

          
          Empty helium tanks are strewn on the front lawn.

                                 NURSE GEORGE
                      You'd think he'd take better care
                      of his house.

          
          A SHADOW falls over the nurses.   They turn to look.

          
          A giant tarp rises behind Carl's house.     It unfolds to reveal

          THOUSANDS OF BALLOONS.

          
          The balloons rise up like some massive multi-colored cumulus
          cloud forming a thunderhead above the house.
          Strings tug at the chimney. The house strains.     Pipes bend,
          then break. Electrical wires spark and snap.
          The house rips away from its foundation.

          
          The nurses duck and YELL as the house soars over them.    Carl
          looks out the window and LAUGHS.

                                CARL
                      So long boys! I'll send you a
                      postcard from Paradise Falls!

          

          INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS


          
          Balloons spill colored light into a little girl's room as the
          house floats past.

          

          EXT. TOWN


          
          The shadow of the house drifts through an intersection.

          

          EXT. SHOP WINDOW


          
          A family watches the house float down the street.

          

          EXT. ABOVE THE TOWN


          
          Carl waves at a high-rise window washer, who tentatively
          waves back.
          The house crests the top of a building, drifting over and away
          from the city. Carl looks out his window. Good riddance.

          

                                                                   25.

          

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM


          
          Carl sets a compass next to the map of South America.

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, BEDROOM WINDOW


          
          Sails made from stitched-together curtains emerge from the
          windows and billow in the wind. Carl steers using ropes
          attached to the weather vane.

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM

          The compass needle rotates to point SOUTH.

          

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE

          The house turns.
          Carl looks out the window, satisfied.   He checks the balloons.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM

          Carl kisses a photo of Ellie.

          

                              CARL
                    We're on our way, Ellie.
          Carl kneels at the fireplace and plunks the balloon strings
          tied to the grate.
          He CHUCKLES and settles into his chair.   He closes his eyes
          and smiles.
          SHADOWS move gently across the fireplace mantle.

          

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING

          The house drifts through the clouds.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM

          Carl relaxes in his chair.

          

          KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.

          

                               CARL
                    Huh?

          

                                                                      26.

          

          
          He stares at the front door.   Nothing.

          

                               CARL
                    Hm.

          

          KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.

          
          He bolts up and approaches the door. He looks out the peep
          hole. Nothing but the porch and clouds. He throws it open.

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - DAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          Nothing. He looks left.     Nothing.   He looks right.   Russell.
          He looks... Russell?!!

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Hi, Mr. Fredricksen.    It's me,
                    Russell.

          

                              CARL
                    What are you doing out here, kid?

          
          Russell is plastered up against the wall, terrified and
          holding on for dear life.

                              RUSSELL
                    I found the snipe and I followed it
                    under your porch, but this snipe
                    had a long tail and looked more
                    like a large mouse.

          
          The flag on Russell's backpack blows off and falls through
          the clouds.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Please let me in?

                               CARL
                    No.

          
          Carl slams the door, leaving Russell alone.
          Beat. The door opens again.

          

                              CARL
                    Oh, alright, you can come...
          Russell runs into the house past Carl.

          

                               CARL
                    ...in.

          

                                                                   27.

          

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          Russell PANTS, panicked.   He looks into living room.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Huh. I've never been in a floating
                    house before.

          
          Carl follows Russell into the living room.   Russell chuckles
          and points at the photo of young Ellie.

                               RUSSELL
                    Goggles.   Look at this stuff!
          Russell finds Ellie's house drawing sitting on the pages of
          the open atlas.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Wow, you going on a trip?
                        (reads from the engraving)
                    "Paradise Falls: A Land Lost in
                    Time." You going to South America,
                    Mr. Fredricksen?
          Carl takes the page and puts it in his pocket.

                              CARL
                    Don't touch that.   You'll soil it.

                              RUSSELL
                    You know, most people take a plane,
                    but you're smart because you'll have
                    all your TV and clocks and stuff.
          Russell runs over to the steering rig.

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Whoah.   Is this how you steer your
                    house?   Does it really work?

          

                              CARL
                    Kid, would you stop with the --
          Russell steers and the house tilts, knocking Carl back and
          forth.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Oh, this makes it go right, and
                    that way's left.

          

                              CARL
                    Let go of the -- knock it off!
          Russell looks out the window in front of him.

          

                                                                    28.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Hey look, buildings!

          

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

          Russell and Carl arrive at the window.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    That building's so close I could
                    almost touch it.

          
          That gives Carl an idea.

                                                              CUT TO:

          
          Carl lowers Russell on a rope below the floating house.

                              RUSSELL
                    Wow! This is great! You should try
                    this, Mr. Fredricksen! Look, there's
                    a bus that could take me home two
                    blocks away!
                        (looking up)
                    Hey, I can see your house from here!

                              CARL
                        (struggling to hold on)
                    Don't jerk around so much, kid!

          
          The rope slips through Carl's hands.   Russell FALLS.

          

                                                              CUT TO:
          Carl stands beside Russell at the window.    Russell's fall had
          been a daydream.

                              CARL
                    Well, that's not gonna work.

          
          Carl leaves Russell at the window.

                              RUSSELL
                    I know that cloud, it's a Cumulo
                    Nimbus. Did you know that the
                    Cumulo Nimbus...

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          GRUMBLING, Carl kneels at the fireplace to cut a few balloon
          strings with his housekeys.

          

                                                                     29.

          

          

                              CARL
                    Stayed up all night blowing up
                    balloons, for what?

          

                              RUSSELL
                    ...warm air goes by cool air, and
                    the airs go by each other and
                    that's how we get lightning.

          

                              CARL
                    That's nice, kid.

          
          Carl turns off his hearing aid.    Silence.   He smiles.
          Russell tries to get Carl's attention.   A storm is brewing in
          the distance.

          

                              RUSSELL
                        (nearly silent)
                    Mr. Fredricksen, there's a big
                    storm coming. It's starting to get
                    scary. We're gonna get blown to
                    bits! We're in big trouble, Mr.
                    Fredricksen!

          
          A huge lightning bolt flash lights up the room.    Carl turns
          on his hearing aid.

          

                              CARL
                    What are you doing over there?

                                RUSSELL
                    Look!

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

          Carl joins Russell at the window.

          

                                RUSSELL
                    See?    Cumulo Nimbus.

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS


          
          The tiny house is heading for a MASSIVE STORM.
          Carl STRUGGLES to steer the house away but is blown into the
          storm. The steering mechanism recoils and sends Carl flying.

          
          Plates fall from the walls and furniture slides as the house
          is rocked in the storm.
          Russell's backpack slides toward the front door.

          

                                                                       30.

          

          

                                RUSSELL
                    My pack!

          
          Russell HOPS on top of the backpack.

          

                                RUSSELL
                    Got ya!

          
          The pack slides toward the OPEN FRONT DOOR. Russell screams.
          He's about to slide out when the house tilts and the door
          swings shut.

          
          The Paradise Falls jar rolls past Carl.     He chases after it.
          Ellie's chair slides across the room.      Carl gasps and runs to
          protect it.

          
          The photo of Ellie rocks and slides off the wall.     Carl
          lunges to catch it.

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING


          
          The storm rages.    The house is tossed into the storm clouds.
          All goes black.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MORNING

          Carl is asleep.
          A finger pokes Carl's face.     Nothing.

          
          The finger pokes Carl's face again.    Carl WAKES UP.

          

                                RUSSELL
                    Whew!    I thought you were dead.

                              CARL
                    Wha... what happened?

          
          Carl STRUGGLES to rise from the pile of Ellie's things he'd
          been protecting.

          

                               RUSSELL
                    I steered us. I did!      I steered
                    the house!

                              CARL
                    Steered us?

          

                                                                  31.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    After you tied your stuff down you
                    took a nap, so I went ahead and
                    steered us down here.

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, WINDOW


          
          Carl opens the window and looks out.

          

                               CARL
                    Huh?

          

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING


          
          The house floats motionless above an ocean of clouds.

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, WINDOW


                              CARL
                    Can't tell where we are.

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM


          

                              RUSSELL
                    Oh we're in South America all
                    right. It was a cinch, with my
                    Wilderness Explorer GPS.

          
          Russell holds up his WILDERNESS EXPLORER GPS UNIT.

                               CARL
                    GP-what?

                              RUSSELL
                    My dad gave it to me. It shows
                    exactly where we are on the planet.
                    With this baby, we'll never be lost!
          Russell gestures, tossing the unit out the window.

          

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING

          Carl and Russell watch the tiny GPS unit descend into the
          clouds.

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Oops.

          

                                                                   32.

          Carl kneels by the fireplace and cuts at the balloon strings.

          

                              CARL
                    We'll get you down, find a bus
                    stop. You just tell the man you
                    want to go back to your mother.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Sure, but I don't think they have
                    busses in Paradise Falls.

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING


          
          A small cluster of balloons fly up and away from the house.

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM


                              CARL
                    There. That ought to do it. Here,
                    I'll give you some change for bus fare.

          
          Russell follows Carl toward the front door.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Nah, I'll just use my city bus pass.

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING


          
          The house lowers into the fog.

          

                              RUSSELL (O.S.)
                    Whoah, that's gonna be like a
                    billion transfers to get back to my
                    house.

          

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH

          Carl and Russell stand on the porch as the house moves down
          into and through the thick, dark clouds.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Mr. Fredricksen, how much longer?

          

                              CARL
                    Well, we're up pretty high.   Could
                    take hours to get down.
          Something flashes by them in the fog.   Carl leans forward.

          

                                                                    33.

                     ...that thing was...building or
                     something.

          
          Another dark object whooshes past them.   Carl ducks.

          

                               RUSSELL
                     What was that, Mr. Fredricksen?

          

                               CARL
                     We can't be close to the ground yet.

          
          A brief view of rocks directly below them.

          
          Carl GASPS.

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, ROCKY LANDSCAPE


          
          BAM!!!   The house CRASHES into the ground.

          
          Russell and Carl fly off the porch and onto the ground.   They
          land hard.

          
          Carl's house is floating away!

          
          Carl runs after the GARDEN HOSE dragging across the ground.

                               CARL
                     Wait, wait! No don't, don't, don't!

          
          Carl grabs the hose and is PULLED UP in the air.

                                CARL
                     Whoah!   Hey, hey!
          Russell JUMPS onto Carl's leg and the extra weight pulls them
          to the ground.

          

                               CARL
                     Russell, hang on!
          Carl and Russell slide toward the edge of a CLIFF EDGE.

          

                                  RUSSELL
                     Whoah!
          They slide toward the edge... and stop.   The drop is
          thousands of feet. Carl is TERRIFIED.

          

                                  CARL
                     Walk back!     Walk back!

          

                                                                    34.

          

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Okay!

          
          Russell PULLS Carl by the leg away from the cliff edge.
          Carl, still hanging from the hose, looks around.
          Fog blankets the mysterious landscape, revealing only
          scattered rocks.

          

                              CARL
                        (out of breath)
                    Where... where are we?

          

                              RUSSELL
                    This doesn't look like the city or
                    the jungle, Mr. Fredricksen.
          The wind picks up and they STRUGGLE against it.

          

                              CARL
                        (to house)
                    Don't worry, Ellie. I got it.
          The wind clears the fog, slowly revealing a crescent shaped,
          flat-topped mountain on which they stand.

          
          Across it, some ten miles away, is PARADISE FALLS.
          Carl stares.   He can't believe it.

          

                               CARL
                    There it is. Ellie, it's so
                    beautiful.

          
          The landscape is stunning.

          
          Carl shows Russell the engraving with the Ellie drawing of
          the house atop the falls.

          

                              CARL
                    We made it. We made it! Russell,
                    we could float right over there.
                    Climb up. Climb up!

          

                              RUSSELL
                    You mean assist you?

          

                              CARL
                    Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Okay, I'll climb up!

          
          Russell CLIMBS Carl, stepping on his leg, arms, and face.

          

                                                                  35.

          

          

                                 CARL
                    Watch it.

          

                                 RUSSELL
                    Sorry.
          The hose jiggles as Russell CLIMBS out of frame.

          

                              CARL
                    Now, when you get up there, go
                    ahead and hoist me up! Got it?!

          
          Russell continues to grunt and strain off screen.

                              CARL
                    You on the porch yet?!

          
          Russell is just inches above Carl, still STRUGGLING to climb.
          He slides down onto Carl's head, exhausted.

          

                              CARL
                    What? That's it?! I came all this
                    way just to get stuck at the wrong
                    end of this rock pile? Aw, great!

          
          Carl paces.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Hey, if I could assist you over
                    there, would you sign off on my
                    badge?

          

                              CARL
                    What are you talking about?

          

                              RUSSELL
                    We could walk your house to the
                    falls!

          

                                 CARL
                    Walk it?

                              RUSSELL
                    Yeah, after all, we weigh it down.
                    We could walk it right over there.
                    Like a parade balloon.
          Carl considers this.

          

                                                                    36.

          

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, ROCKY LANDSCAPE, DAY - LATER


          
          The house floats against the sky. The hose descends from the
          house and "Y"s to tie to both Carl and Russell. They wear
          the hose like a harness, pulling the house as they walk.

                              CARL
                    Now, we're gonna walk to the falls
                    quickly and quietly, with no rap
                    music or flash-dancing.
          Russell inspects his surroundings.

                              RUSSELL

                        (DISTRACTED)
                    Uh-huh.

          

                              CARL
                    We have three days, at best, before
                    the helium leaks out of those
                    balloons. And if we're not at the
                    falls when that happens...

          

                                 RUSSELL
                    Sand!

                              CARL
                    ...we're not getting to the falls!

                              RUSSELL
                    I found sand!

          
          Carl ROLLS HIS EYES.    He looks up at the house.

                              CARL
                    Don't you worry, Ellie.    We'll get
                    our house over there.
          Russell looks up at the house.   Who's Carl talking to?

          

                                 RUSSELL
                    Huh.
                        (shrugs it off)
                    This is fun already, isn't it? By
                    the time we get there, you're gonna
                    feel so assisted... Oh, Mr.
                    Fredricksen, if we happen to get
                    separated, use the Wilderness
                    Explorer call. Caw caw, raaar!!

          
          The WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL sets off Carl's hearing aid.

          

                                                                      37.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Wait. Why are we going to Paradise
                    Falls again?

          

                              CARL
                    Hey, let's play a game. It's
                    called: "See who can be quiet the
                    longest."

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Cool!   My mom loves that game!

          
          They head toward Paradise Falls, some 10 miles away.

                                                         DISSOLVE TO:

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY

          Mist hangs ominously over a rocky landscape.
          Something tall blasts through a maze of rocks.

          
          Two dark shapes are chasing the prey.   Each has a light.
          Hunters.

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, GROVE OF TREES - CONTINUOUS

          The prey dodges various TRAPS, one after another. A metal
          cage slams shut, a hidden net, darts on a trip wire.

          
          The prey runs into a clearing surrounded by rocks: a dead end.

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, CLEARING - CONTINUOUS

          The hunters surround the prey, stepping out into the light: a
          sinister Doberman Pinscher, a Rottweiler, and a bulldog, each
          wearing large, HIGH-TECH COLLARS.

          
          They surround the prey.   Escape looks impossible.
          WOOSH! The bird moves impossibly fast, jumping over the
          three dogs and escaping in a flash.

          
          The dogs head off in pursuit.
          A HIGH PITCHED SQUEAL stops the dogs short, their ears
          wincing in pain. They whimper and run off.

          

                                                                   38.

          

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, THICK JUNGLE - DAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          Carl steps out from behind a shrub.   The SQUEALING is in fact
          his HEARING AID.

          

                              CARL
                    Darn thing.
                        (calling back)
                    C'mon, Russell, would you hurry it up?

          
          Russell plods forward, dragging his feet.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    I'm tiiiired. And my knee hurts.

          

                              CARL
                    Which knee?

                              RUSSELL
                    My elbow hurts and I have to go to
                    the bathroom.

          

                              CARL
                    I asked you about that five minutes
                    ago!

                              RUSSELL
                    Well, I didn't have to go then!
          Russell goes limp and lies face down in the dirt.

                              RUSSELL
                    I don't want to walk anymore.     Can
                    we stop?

          

                              CARL
                    Russell! If you don't hurry up,
                    the tigers will eat you.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    There's no tigers in South America.
          Russell rolls over to show Carl a badge.

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Zoology.

                              CARL
                    Oh, for the love of Pete. Go on into
                    the bushes and do your business.

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Okay!   Here, hold my stuff.

          

                                                                     39.

          

          
          Somehow energized, Russell jams his pack into Carl's hands,
          secures his rope to a tree and tromps off into the shrubs.

          
          He goes into the woods carrying a small shovel in one hand
          and a pile of leaves in another.

                              RUSSELL
                    I've always wanted to try this!

          
          Carl waits, standing by the tree his house is tied to.

                              RUSSELL (O.S.)
                    Mr. Fredricksen? Am I supposed to
                    dig the hole before or after?

          

                               CARL
                    Eugh!   None of my concern!
          Beat.

          

                                RUSSELL (O.S.)
                    Oh.    It's before!

          
          Carl covers his ears.

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, THICK JUNGLE - CONTINUOUS


          
          Russell pats down a mound and SIGHS in satisfaction.

          
          He is about to return to Carl when he spots some TRACKS.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Huh?  Tracks?!

                        (REALIZING)
                    Snipe!
          Russell follows the tracks into the dark jungle, clapping.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Here, snipe... Come on out, snipe.
                    Snipe!
          The footprints continue for a time, then stop.

          

                                RUSSELL
                    Huh.
          Russell munches on a chocolate bar.

          
          Something RUSTLES in the bushes behind him.   He turns to look.
          Behind him, A BEAK takes a nibble of the chocolate and zips
          out.

          

                                                                      40.

          

          
          Russell turns.    Nothing there.

          
          Another nibble!   Zip!

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Ha! Gotcha!

          
          Russell peers into the shrub.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Don't be afraid, little snipe. I
                    am a Wilderness Explorer so I am a
                    friend to all of nature. Want some
                    more?

          
          Russell holds out the chocolate.   The beak pokes out and
          nibbles.

                                RUSSELL
                    Hi boy.    Don't eat it all.   Come on
                    out.

          
          The beak zips back into the bushes.

                             RUSSELL
                    Come on. Don't be afraid little
                    snipe. Nice snipe. Good little
                    snipe. Nice...
          A massive shadowy creature rises up over Russell.

                              RUSSELL
                    ...giant snipe!

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, THICK JUNGLE CLEARING


          
          Carl checks the knot on his hose harness.    Russell and the
          massive creature step up behind him.

                              RUSSELL
                    I found the snipe!

          

                              CARL
                        (humoring him)
                    Oh, did you?

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Are they tall?

          

                              CARL
                    Oh yes, they're very tall.

          

                                                                   41.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Do they have a lot of colors?

          

                              CARL
                    They do indeed.

                              RUSSELL
                    Do they like chocolate?

          

                               CARL
                    Oh ye-   Chocolate?

          
          Carl turns to look.
          Next to Russell stands a 13 foot tall, multicolored BIRD.

          
          Carl SCREAMS.

                              CARL
                    What is that thing?!

                              RUSSELL
                    It's a snipe!

                              CARL
                    There's no such thing as a snipe!

          

                              RUSSELL
                    But you said snipes eat--

          
          Carl grabs Russell, pulling him away from the bird.

          
          The bird HISSES at Carl and grabs Russell back.   It cradles
          Russell like a baby.

          

                                RUSSELL
                    Whoah!
          Russell GIGGLES.

          
          Carl pokes at the bird with his cane, trying to scare it off.

                              CARL
                    Go on, get out of here. Go on!
                    Shoo!

          
          The bird HISSES.
          It takes Russell up into a tree, swinging him around
          playfully. It looks scary and fun.

          

                              RUSSELL

                        (LAUGHING)
                    Whoah! Whoah!

          

                                                                        42.

          

          

                              CARL
                    Careful, Russell!

          

                              RUSSELL

                        (LAUGHING)
                    Hey, look Mr. Fredricksen, it likes
                    me!

          

                                 CARL
                    Russell!
          The bird grooms Russell.

          

                              RUSSELL

                        (LAUGHING)
                    No stop, that tickles!

          
          Carl pokes the bird with his cane.

                              CARL
                    Get out of here.    Go on, git!

          
          The bird sets Russell down.     It stalks Carl, HISSING and
          ruffling its feathers.

          

                                 CARL
                    Aaaah!

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Uh-oh! No no no no no Kevin, it's
                    okay. Mr. Fredricksen is nice!

          
          Russell pats Carl on the head.

                                 CARL
                    "Kevin"?

                              RUSSELL
                    Yeah, that's his name I just gave
                    him.

          
          The bird pats Carl on the head with its beak.

                              CARL
                    Hey. Beat it! Vamoose! Scram!

          
          Carl waves his cane.    The bird eats it.

                               CARL
                    Hey!   That's mine!

          
          The bird chokes and the cane comes back up.

          

                                                                  43.

          

          

                               CARL
                    Aaah!   Shoo, shoo! Get out of here.

          
          Carl shoos the bird away.     The bird mimics him.

          

                              CARL
                    Go on, beat it.

          
          GRUMBLING, Carl gives up and throws his hands in the air.

          
          The bird mimics this as well.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Can we keep him? Please?? I'll
                    get the food for him, I'll walk
                    him, I'll change his newspapers...

          

                                 CARL
                    No.

          

                              RUSSELL

                        (RECITING)
                    "An Explorer is a friend to all, be
                    it plants or fish or tiny mole."

          

                              CARL
                    That doesn't even rhyme.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Yeah it does.
          Russell points up to the roof of Carl's house.

          

                                 RUSSELL
                    Hey, look!     Kevin!

          

                              CARL
                    What? Get down! You're not
                    allowed up there!

          
          The bird is on Carl's roof. It swallows a balloon. It POPS.
          The bird coughs up the deflated balloon. Russell GIGGLES.

                              CARL
                    You come down here right now!

          
          The bird jumps down and hides behind Russell.

                               CARL
                    Sheesh!   Can you believe this, Ellie?

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Ellie?
                        (gets idea)

                              (MORE)

          

                                                                  44.
                              RUSSELL (cont'd)
                    Uh, hey Ellie, could I keep the
                    bird? Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
                        (to Carl)
                    She said for you to let me.

          

                              CARL
                        (to Ellie)
                    But I told him no --
                        (catches himself)
                    I told you no! N-O.
          The bird HISSES at Carl.

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, ROCKY LANDSCAPE - DAY


          
          Carl and Russell pull the house through the mist.
          Russell discreetly drops chocolate pieces along their trail.

          
          The bird follows, eating.

          

                              CARL
                    I see you back there!

          
          It "hides" behind a rock, still totally visible.

          

                              CARL
                    Go on, get out of here. Shoo! Go
                    annoy someone else for a while.

                              VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hey, are you okay over there?
          The bird dashes away.

          

                                 CARL
                    Uh, hello?

          
          Carl and Russell look around. In the midst, some 100 feet
          away, they see the FIGURE OF A MAN.

                               CARL
                    Oh!   Hello sir!    Thank goodness.

          
          Carl walks toward the man.

                              CARL
                    It's nice to know someone else is
                    up here!

          

                              VOICE
                    I can smell you.

          

                                                                  45.

          

          
          Carl stops.

          

                                CARL
                    What?    You can smell us?

          

                              VOICE
                    I can smell you.

          
          As they get closer, they realize the man is in fact a ROCK.

          

                                CARL
                    Hey.

          
          Russell GIGGLES.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    You were talking to a rock.
          Russell points to another rock shape.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Hey, that one looks like a turtle!

          
          Sure enough.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Look at that one!     That one looks
                    like a dog!
          The "rock" walks forward.

                              RUSSELL
                    It is a dog!

                                CARL
                    What?

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Uh, we're not allowed to have dogs
                    in my apartment.
          The dog nuzzles Russell, who nervously pets it.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Hey, I like dogs!

          

                              CARL
                        (calls out)
                    We have your dog!
                        (to self)
                    Wonder who he belongs to?

                                RUSSELL
                    Sit boy.

          

                                                                 46.

          

          
          The dog sits.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Hey look, he's trained!    Shake!

          
          The dog raises his paw and Russell shakes it.

          

                                RUSSELL
                    Uh-huh.    Speak.

          

                                DUG
                    Hi there.

          
          Carl and Russell freeze.

          

                              CARL
                    Did that dog just say "Hi there?"

                                DUG
                    Oh yes.
          Carl JUMPS back.

          

                              DUG
                    My name is Dug. I have just met
                    you and I love you.

          
          Dug jumps up on to Carl.

                                CARL
                    Uh..wha?

          
          Dug wears a high-tech collar. The dog's thoughts come out of
          it as words through a speaker. It can talk. Unfortunately,
          it talks non-stop.

          

                              DUG
                    My master made me this collar. He
                    is a good and smart master and he
                    made me this collar so that I may
                    talk -- SQUIRREL!!
          Dug stares transfixed at a tree.    False alarm.

          

                              DUG
                    My master is good and smart.

                              CARL
                    It's not possible.

          

                              DUG
                    Oh it is, because my master is
                    smart.

          

                                                             47.

          

          

                                 RUSSELL
                       Cool! What do these do, boy?

          
          He inspects the collar and twists a dial.

          

                                 DUG

                       -to talk with, I would be happy if
                       you stopped.

          

                                 CARL
                       Russell, don't touch that. It could
                       be radioactive or something.
          Dug sniffs the ground around Carl and Russell.

          

                                 DUG
                       I am a great tracker. My pack sent
                       me on a special mission all by
                       myself. Have you seen a bird? I
                       want to find one and I have been on
                       the scent. I am a great tracker,
                       did I mention that?
          BAM!   The bird tackles Dug and HISSES.

          

                                 DUG
                       Hey, that is the bird! I have
                       never seen one up close but this is
                       the bird.
                           (to Carl)
                       May I take your bird back to camp
                       as my prisoner?

          

                                 CARL
                       Yes! Take it! And on the way,
                       learn how to bark like a real dog!

          

                                 DUG
                       Oh I can bark!
          Dug BARKS.

          

                                 DUG
                       And here's howling!
          Dug HOWLS.    The bird HISSES at Dug.

          

                                                                    48.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Can we keep him? Please please
                    please?

          

                                CARL
                    No.

          
          Russell falls to his knees, pleading.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    But it's a talking dog!

          

                              CARL
                    It's just a weird trick or
                    something. Let's get to the falls.

          
          Carl grabs Russell.   The bird follows, as does Dug.

                              DUG
                    Please be my prisoner. Oh please oh
                    please be my prisoner.

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, THICK JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY


          
          Footprints.   A dog's nose follows the tracks.   This is GAMMA,
          a bulldog.

          

                              GAMMA
                    Oh, here it is.    I picked up the
                    bird's scent!

          
          A second dog: BETA, a Rottweiler.

                               BETA
                    Wait a minute, wait a minute! What
                    is this? Chocolate. I smell
                    chocolate.

          

                              GAMMA
                    I'm getting prunes and denture
                    cream! Who are they?

                              BETA
                    Ah man, Master will not be pleased.
                    We'd better tell him someone took
                    the bird, right Alpha?
          ALPHA, a Doberman pinscher, sits with his back to them.

          

                              ALPHA
                        (high-pitched voice)
                    No. Soon enough the bird will be
                    ours yet again.

          

                                                                       49.

          

          
          Alpha's voice is high and squeaky, as if he's breathed in
          helium.

          

                              ALPHA (CONT'D)
                    Find the scent, my compadres and
                    you two shall have much rewardings
                    from Master for the toil factor you
                    wage.

          
          Beta and Gamma look at each other.

                              BETA
                    Hey Alpha, I think there's
                    something wrong with your collar.
                    You must have bumped it.

          

                              GAMMA
                    Yeah, your voice sounds funny!
          Beta and Gamma LAUGH.   Alpha turns.   They stop laughing.

                              ALPHA
                    Beta. Gamma. Mayhaps you desire
                    to -- SQUIRREL!

          
          All three dogs look for the squirrel.   False alarm.

          

                              ALPHA (CONT'D)
                    Mayhaps you desire to challenge the
                    ranking that I have been assigned
                    by my strength and cunning?

          

                              BETA
                    No no. But maybe Dug would.     You
                    might want to ask him.

          
          Beta and Gamma SNICKER derisively.

                              GAMMA
                    Yeah, I wonder if he's found the
                    bird on his very special mission.

                              ALPHA
                    Do not mention Dug to me at this
                    time. His fool's errand will keep
                    him most occupied, most occupied
                    indeed. Ha ha ha. Do you not
                    agree with that which I am saying
                    to you now?

          

                              BETA
                    Sure, but the second Master finds
                    out you sent Dug out by himself,
                    none of us will get a treat.

          

                                                                     50.

          

          

                              ALPHA
                    You are wise, my trusted
                    Lieutenant.

          
          Alpha powers up a video screen on Beta's collar.

                              ALPHA (CONT'D)
                    This is Alpha calling Dug.   Come
                    in, Dug.

          
          The screen shows ground moving past: the view from Dug's
          collar.

          

                                DUG
                    Hi Alpha.    Hey, your voice sounds
                    funny.

          

                              ALPHA
                    I know, I know!   Have you seen the
                    bird?

                              DUG
                    Why yes, the bird is my prisoner
                    now.

          

                              GAMMA
                    Yeah, right.

          
          The screen view adjusts to see the bird.   It hisses.

          

                              ALPHA
                    Impossible! Where are you?!

          

                              DUG
                    I am here with the bird and I will
                    bring it back and then you will
                    like me. Oh, gotta go.
          On the collar screen, the dogs get a fleeting glimpse of a
          boy's face. It's Russell.

          

                              RUSSELL
                        (on video screen)
                    Hey Dug! Who you talking to?

          
          The video screen goes blank.   The dogs BARK excitedly.

                              BETA
                    What's Dug doing?

          

                              GAMMA
                    Why's he with that small mailman?

          

                                                                    51.

          

          

                              BETA
                    Where are they?

          
          Alpha pushes a button on Beta's collar.    A TRACKING DEVICE
          locates Dug.

                              ALPHA
                    There he is. Come on!

          
          The dogs sprint off into the jungle.

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, JUNGLE - DAY

          The bird drags Dug, still clamped onto it's leg.

          

                              DUG
                    Oh please oh please oh PLEASE be my
                    prisoner!

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Dug, stop bothering Kevin!

          

                              DUG
                    That man there says I can take the
                    bird and I love that man there like
                    he is my master.

          
          The bird HISSES.

          

                              CARL
                    I am not your master!

          
          The bird tries to shake Dug off its leg.   Dug jumps up on it.

          

                              DUG
                    I am warning you, once again, bird!

                                 RUSSELL
                    Hey!     Quit it!

          

                              DUG
                    I am jumping on you now, bird.

          
          Russell tries to separate them, which pulls on Carl's tether.

          

                              CARL
                    Russell! At this rate we'll never
                    get to the falls!

          
          Carl pulls on the tether, knocking Russell over.   Carl falls,
          pulling the house into a tall rock. SMASH!
          Carl GASPS.   He turns his anger to the group.

          

                                                                   52.

          

          

                              CARL
                    I am nobody's master, got it?
                        (points to bird)
                    I don't want you here,
                        (points to Dug)
                    ...and I don't want you here.
                        (points to Russell)
                    I'm stuck with you. And if you two
                    don't clear out of here by the time
                    I count to three-
          Dug sees the tennis balls on Carl's cane.

          

                               DUG
                    A ball!   Oh boy oh boy!     A ball!

          

                               CARL
                    Ball?
          Carl pops off one of the tennis balls.

          

                              CARL
                    You want it boy?     Huh?   Huh?   Yeah?

                              DUG
                    Oh oh oh! Yes, I do.        I do ever so
                    want the ball!

          

                              CARL
                    Go get it!!
          Carl throws the ball far away.    Dug chases after it.

          

                              DUG
                    Oh boy, oh boy! I will get it and
                    then bring it back!

          

                              CARL

                        (WHISPERS)
                    Quick Russell, give me some chocolate.

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Why?

          

                              CARL
                    Just give it to me!
          Carl grabs some chocolate and waves it at the bird.

          

                               CARL
                    Bird.   Bird!
          Carl THROWS the chocolate.     The bird runs after it.

          

                                                                        53.

          

          
          Carl grabs Russell and runs.

          

                              CARL
                    C'mon Russell!

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Wait.   Wait, Mr. Fredricksen.

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN HILLSIDE

          Carl pulls them down a slope.     He slips.

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN TREETOPS


          
          Above the tree line, the house SMASHES into a tree.

                                 CARL
                    Daah!

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN STREAM

          Carl and Russell crossing the river balance on rocks.        Carl
          slips and his foot goes into the water.

          

                                 CARL
                    Aaahh...

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN JUNGLE


          

                              RUSSELL
                    What are we doing?

          
          Carl pushes through thick jungle leaves.      BUGS buzz around him.

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN STEEP HILLSIDE


          
          Carl climbs up the hill.      He FALLS over a dead branch.

                              RUSSELL
                    Hey, uh, we're pretty far now.
                    Kevin's gonna miss me.

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, JUNGLE CLEARING - CONTINUOUS


          
          They climb over a ridge.      Dug and the bird are nowhere in sight.
          Carl sits down on a rock, BREATHING HARD.

          

                                                                         54.

          

          

                                CARL
                      I think that did the trick.

          
          He turns.   Dug.     With the ball in his mouth.

          

                                DUG
                      Hi, Master.

          

                                   CARL
                      Afternoon.
          Carl turns the other way.       The bird.   It HONKS at him.

          
          Dug drops the slobbery ball on Carl's lap.

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, FLAT ROCKY AREA - NIGHT

          A clap of thunder. Lightning flashes reveal rain pouring
          down on the house. Beneath it, Carl and Russell are kept
          dry, sitting around a pathetic flickering campfire.

          
          Carl looks at Dug, asleep, wrapped around the bird's leg.        He
          rolls his eyes and looks up at the house.

          

                                CARL
                      Well, thanks for keeping us dry
                      anyway, Ellie.

                                RUSSELL (O.S.)
                      Which one's the front?

          
          Russell struggles to set up the tent.       He reads his manual.

                                RUSSELL
                      Is this step three, or step five?
          Carl ROLLS HIS EYES at Russell's ineptness.

          

                                   RUSSELL
                      There!
          Russell struggles with a tent pole, trying to winch it into
          place.

          
          Carl can't watch.
          An off screen SMACK!      Russell walks to Carl.   Miraculously,
          he looks unscathed.

          

                                   RUSSELL
                      All done.
          Russell turns, revealing a large RED WELT on his face.

          

                                                                  55.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                        (pointing to tent)
                    That's for you!

          
          The tent pole springs loose, catapulting the tent over the
          cliff.

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Awh.   Tents are hard.

          

                              CARL
                    Wait, aren't you "Super Wilderness
                    Guy?" With the GPM's and the badges?

                              RUSSELL
                    Yeah, but... can I tell you a
                    secret?

                               CARL
                    No.

                              RUSSELL
                    Alright, here goes. I never
                    actually built a tent before.
                    There. I said it.

                              CARL
                    You've been camping before, haven't
                    you?

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Well, never outside.

          

                              CARL
                    Well, why didn't you ask your Dad
                    how to build a tent?

                              RUSSELL
                    I don't think he wants to talk
                    about this stuff.

          

                              CARL
                    Why don't you try him sometime?
                    Maybe he'll surprise you.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Well, he's away a lot.   I don't see
                    him much.

          

                              CARL
                    He's got to be home sometime.

          

                                                                   56.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Well, I called, but Phyllis told me
                    I bug him too much.

          

                              CARL
                    Phyllis? You call your own mother
                    by her first name?

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Phyllis isn't my mom.
          Carl realizes he put his foot in it.

          

                               CARL
                    Oh.

          
          The two sit silently together, watching the fire.

                              RUSSELL
                    But he promised he'd come to my
                    Explorer ceremony to pin on my
                    Assisting the Elderly badge, so he
                    can show me about tents then,
                    right?

          
          Carl studies Russell's sad optimism.   He looks at the missing
          badge on Russell's sash.

          

                              CARL
                    Hey, uh, why don't you get some
                    sleep. Don't want to wake up the
                    traveling flea circus.

          
          Dug nuzzles around the sleeping bird's leg.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Mr. Fredricksen, Dug says he wants
                    to take Kevin prisoner. We have to
                    protect him!

          
          Russell YAWNS and lies down on the rock next to Carl.

                              RUSSELL
                    Can Kevin go with us?

          

                               CARL
                    Alright.   He can come.

                              RUSSELL
                    Promise you won't leave him?

          

                               CARL
                    Yeah.

          

                                                                    57.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Cross your heart?

          
          Carl looks down at Russell.

          

                              CARL
                    Cross my heart.

          
          Carl sits at the campfire, the others asleep.    He shakes his
          head and looks up at the house.

                              CARL
                    What have I got myself into, Ellie?

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, FLAT ROCKY AREA - MORNING

          A frog sits next to Carl's glasses. It CROAKS. Carl's hand
          smacks it like an alarm clock. The frog hops away.

          
          Carl rises, looking up at the house.

                              CARL
                    Morning Sweetheart.

          
          The balloons on the house are wilting.

                              CARL
                    We better get moving.

          
          He scans the camp.   The bird is gone.

                              CARL
                    Huh. Bird's gone. Maybe Russell
                    won't notice.
                        (calls out)
                    Alright, everybody up!

          
          Russell sits up with a SNORT.

                              RUSSELL
                    Where's Kevin? He's wandered off!
                    Kevin! Dug, find Kevin!

          
          Dug crazily searches and sniffs, looking for the bird.

                              DUG
                    Find the bird.    Find the bird...

                    POINT!
          Dug goes rigid like a pointer dog and "points" to the left.

          

                                                                   58.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Oh, look! There he is.

          
          Russell points to the right.   The bird is on top of Carl's
          house.
          Dug turns around.

          

                              DUG

                    POINT!
          The bird has gathered a pile of food on Carl's roof.

          

                              CARL
                    Hey, that's my food!   Get off my
                    roof!

          

                              DUG
                    Yeah, get off of his <>!

          
          In the distance, BABY BIRDS call out.   The bird CALLS back.

          

                              CARL
                    What is it doing?

          

                              DUG
                    The bird is calling to her babies.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Her babies! Kevin's a girl?
          The bird gobbles the food and jumps off the roof.

          

                              DUG
                    Her house is over there in those
                    twisty rocks.
          Miles off is a huge grouping of rocks; the LABYRINTH.   The
          baby birds call from somewhere inside.

          

                              DUG
                    She has been gathering food for her
                    babies and must get back to them.

          
          The bird "hugs" Russell goodbye and pats Carl on the head
          with her beak. She HISSES at Dug.

                              RUSSELL
                    Wait, Kevin's just leaving? But
                    you promised to protect her!

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Her babies need her, we gotta make
                    sure they're together.

          

                                                                   59.

          

          
          The bird hurries off toward the labyrinth.   Carl gathers up
          the hose tether.

          

                              CARL
                    Sorry Russell. We've lost enough
                    time already.

          

                                 RUSSELL
                    Yeah...

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, EDGE OF JUNGLE - MOMENTS LATER


          
          The bird rounds a corner and hears rustling in the bushes
          ahead. She scampers back toward the house.

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, FLAT ROCKY AREA

          Russell chews on some chocolate.

                              RUSSELL
                    This was her favorite chocolate.
                    Because you sent her away, there's
                    more for you.
          Carl rolls his eyes and SIGHS.

          
          They hear rustling from the bushes behind them.

          

                                 CARL
                    Huh?

          

                                 RUSSELL
                    Kevin?

          
          Beta and Gamma, run toward Carl and Russell, viciously
          barking and growling. Carl protects Russell with his cane.

          
          Dug is conflicted.

          
          Alpha walks forward and stares menacingly at Carl.
          He turns toward Dug.

          

                              ALPHA
                        (high-pitched voice)
                    Where's the bird? You said you had
                    the bird.

          

                              DUG
                    Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Since I have
                    said that, I can see how you would
                    think that.

          

                                                                      60.

          

          

                              ALPHA
                    Where is it?

          

                              DUG
                    Uh, tomorrow. Come back tomorrow
                    and then I will again have the
                    bird. Yes.

          
          Alpha BARKS angrily.

          

                              ALPHA
                    You lost it. Why do I not have a
                    surprised feeling? Well, at least
                    you now have lead us to the small
                    mailman and The One Who Smells of
                    Prunes.

          
          Carl and Russell look at Dug.    He turned on them!   Dug
          shamefully lowers his head.

          

                              ALPHA
                    Master will be most pleased we have
                    found them, and will ask of them
                    many questions.
                        (commanding, to Carl)
                    Come!

          

                              CARL
                    Wait, we're not going with you.
                    We're going to the falls!
          Gamma and Beta BARK fiercely at Carl.

          

                              CARL
                    Get away from me! Get down!

          
          The dogs lead Carl and Russell like prisoners.    Dug follows.
          The house is pulled after them, and on the roof: THE BIRD.

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, DESOLATE ROCKY AREA - DAY

          Alpha leads Carl and Russell through a canyon.

          
          Dogs patrol the tops of the canyon walls.
          Four more large dogs join the group.    Carl and Russell watch
          warily and continue their march.

          
          They round a bend.     Before them is a MASSIVE CAVE OPENING.

          

                                                                      61.

          

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, CAVE ENTRANCE


          
          The house and balloon canopy are dwarfed as the group
          approaches the huge cave opening.

          
          DOZENS OF DOGS step out of the cave. Carl and Russell stop.
          More dogs approach from the side. Every way Carl turns there
          are more dogs!

          
          Growling and snarling, the dogs surround Carl and Russell.
          Closer... closer...

          
          From the darkness a voice:

                               VOICE (O.S.)
                    Stay!

          
          The dogs stop. A figure peers out from the darkness.      It
          examines Carl, Russell, and the floating house.

          

                              VOICE
                    You came here in that?

          

                              CARL
                    Uh... yeah.

                              VOICE
                    In a house? A floating house?
          The man laughs.   Carl and Russell laugh along nervously.

                               VOICE
                    That is the darndest thing I've
                    ever seen! You're not after my
                    bird, are you? But if you need to
                    borrow a cup of sugar, I'd be happy
                    to oblige!
          The dogs LAUGH uproariously at the man's joke.

          

                              VOICE
                    Well, this is all a misunderstanding.
                    My dogs made a mistake.

          
          The figure walks out toward Carl into the light.   Carl
          recognizes him!

                              CARL
                    Wait, are you Charles Muntz?!

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Well... Yes.

          

                                                                    62.

          

          

                              CARL
                    The Charles Muntz?

          
          Muntz gives him the "thumbs up."

          

                              MUNTZ
                    "Adventure is out there!"

          
          Carl GIGGLES with glee.

          

                              CARL
                    It's really him!
                        (to Russell)
                    That's Charles Muntz!

                              RUSSELL

                        (EXCITED)
                    It is?!?

                        (CONSIDERS)
                    Who's Charles Muntz?

          

                                CARL
                    Him!

          

                                DOG WALLA
                    Yes!    It is him! He is!

                              CARL
                    I'm Carl Fredricksen. My wife and
                    I, we were your biggest fans!

          
          Carl rushes to shake Muntz's hand.    Muntz is charmed.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Well, you're a man of good taste!

          
          Muntz LAUGHS at his joke.    Carl joins in.

                              MUNTZ
                    You must be tired.     Hungry?

          

                                RUSSELL
                    Uh-huh.

                              MUNTZ
                        (to dogs)
                    Attention everyone! These people
                    are no longer intruders. They are
                    our guests.

          
          The dogs CHEER.

          

                                                                  63.

          

          

                              DOG WALLA
                    Follow me! I like you temporarily.
                    You do smell like prunes. I will
                    not bite you.

          
          Muntz walks into the cave. Carl and Russell excitedly follow.

          

          INT. CAVE - CONTINUOUS


          

                                CARL
                    Wow.

          
          Carl's eyes adjust to the dark. Muntz's dirigible the
          "Spirit of Adventure" is tethered in the cave.

          

                              MUNTZ (O.S.)
                    I'm sorry about the dogs -- hope
                    they weren't too rough on you.

          

                              GAMMA (O.S.)
                    We weren't!

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Go ahead and moor your airship
                    right next to mine.

          
          Muntz gestures to a pylon, where Carl ties off the house.
          Muntz and the dogs walk up the gangplank of the dirigible.

          

                              CARL
                    We're not actually going inside the
                    "Spirit of Adventure" itself?!

                                MUNTZ
                    Oh.    Would you like to?

                              CARL
                    Would I?!?!

          
          Carl GIGGLES like a little boy.

                              CARL
                    Wait up, Mr. Muntz!

          
          Carl and Russell follow up the ramp.

                              CARL
                    Jiminy Cricket.

          
          Dug follows, but is blocked by Alpha and Beta.

                                BETA
                    Not you.

          

                                                                      64.

          

          

                              GAMMA
                    What do we do with Dug?

          

                              ALPHA
                    He has lost the bird.     Put him in
                    the Cone of Shame.

          
          Dug WHIMPERS.

          

          EXT. DIRIGIBLE GANGPLANK - MOMENTS LATER


          
          Alpha, Gamma and Beta walk into the dirigible.   Dug sits
          forlornly with a PLASTIC CONE around his neck.

          

                              DUG
                    I do not like the Cone of Shame.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE - TROPHY ROOM

          Carl and Russell are speechless as they walk into the room.
          It's a treasure trove of giant skeletons, stuffed creatures,
          and rare cultural artifacts.

          
          Various servant dogs dust and polish as Muntz leads Carl and
          Russell through the room.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Most of the collection is housed in
                    the world's top museums: New York,
                    Munich, London... `Course I kept
                    the best for myself.

                              CARL
                    Did you ever! Will you look at that?

                              MUNTZ
                    Oh yes, the Arsinoitherium. Beast
                    charged while I was brushing my
                    teeth. Used my shaving kit to
                    bring him down.
          A dog approaches carrying a menu.    Muntz waves it off.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Oh, surprise me.
                        (to Carl)
                    Only way to get it out of Ethiopia
                    at the time was to have it declared
                    as "dental equipment!"
          Muntz LAUGHS.   Behind him, a dog can't resist gnawing at one
          of the bones.

          

                                                                  65.

          

          

                              CARL
                    Oh my gosh, the Giant Somalian
                    Leopard Tortoise!

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Oh, you recognize it? I'm
                    impressed! That's an interesting
                    story there...

          
          A dog approaches with a bottle of champagne in his mouth.
          Muntz glances at the bottle.

          

                               MUNTZ
                    Hm, excellent choice.
                        (to Carl)
                    I found it on safari with
                    Roosevelt.
          Two dogs work together to remove the cork from the bottle.
          POP! They sloppily pour two glasses.

                              MUNTZ
                    He and I fell into a habit of
                    playing gin rummy in the evenings.
                    And did he cheat? Oh, he was
                    horrible!

          
          Muntz and Carl LAUGH.   Alpha interrupts.

                              ALPHA
                        (high-pitched voice)
                    Master, dinner is ready.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Oh dear, broken translator.   It's
                    that loose wire again.
                        (leans down, fixes it)
                    There you go big fella.

          

                              ALPHA
                        (deep scary voice)
                    Thank you Master.
          Russell reacts.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    I liked his other voice.
          Muntz LAUGHS.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Well, dinner is served!    Right this
                    way.

          

                                                                    66.

          

          

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, DINING ROOM


          
          Muntz leads Carl and Russell into the dining room and up to a
          large table.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    So how are things stateside?
                    Almost tempted to go back a few
                    times, but I have unfinished work
                    here... Please.
          Dogs pull back chairs for them.   They sit.   Dog waiters place
          napkins on their laps.

                              MUNTZ
                    I hope you're hungry because
                    Epsilon is the finest chef I've
                    ever had.
          Dogs bring out covered plates, look at each other, and remove
          the silver plate covers at the same time. The meals look
          delicious.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Oh, Epsilon, you've done it again!

                              RUSSELL
                    Yes!!
          Russell is served a hot dog.   His waiter can't resist and
          eats a bite.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Hey!

          
          Another dog pours some juice then takes a big slurp from his
          glass.

                              RUSSELL
                    Hey!

          
          Carl looks around, still enthralled.

                              CARL
                    Oh my Ellie would have loved all
                    this. You know, it's because of
                    you she had this dream to come down
                    here and live by Paradise Falls.

          
          He gestures toward HIS HOUSE, tethered outside the porthole
          window.

          

                                                                    67.

          

          

                              MUNTZ
                    I'm honored. And now you've made
                    it!

          

                              CARL
                    You're sure we're not a bother?
                    I'd hate to impose.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    No no! It's a pleasure to have
                    guests -- a real treat.

          
          The dogs erupt into excited barking.

                               DOG WALLA
                    Treat?!   Treat! I want a treat!

          

                              MUNTZ
                    No no, quiet! Calm down.     Calm
                    down...
          In the excitement a dog swipes the rest of Russell's hot dog.

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Hey!

                              MUNTZ

                        (CONT'D)
                    Shouldn't've used that word...
                    Having guests is a delight. More
                    often I get thieves, come to steal
                    what's rightfully mine.

                               CARL
                    No!

          
          Muntz picks up a lantern and walks to the back of the room.

                              MUNTZ
                    They called me a fraud, those...
                    dah! But once I bring back this
                    creature, my name will be cleared.
          The lantern illuminates photographs, drawings, samples,
          feathers. Hundreds of them... all of THE BIRD. Kevin.

          
          This is Muntz's obsession. He looks over to a full size
          skeleton.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Beautiful, isn't it? I've spent a
                    lifetime tracking it. Sometimes
                    years go by between sightings...

          

                               (MORE)

          

                                                                   68.
                              MUNTZ (cont'd)
                    I've tried to smoke it out of that
                    deathly labyrinth where it lives...
                    Can't go in after it. Once in,
                    there's no way out. Lost so many
                    dogs...
          Muntz is lost in reverie.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    And here they come, these bandits,
                    and think the bird is theirs to
                    take! But they soon find that this
                    mountain is a very dangerous
                    place.

          
          Distracted Russell finally notices the skeleton.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Hey, that looks like Kevin!

          

                                 MUNTZ
                    "Kevin?"

          

                             RUSSELL
                    Yeah! That's my new giant bird
                    pet. I trained it to follow us.

          
          Muntz and Alpha exchange glances.

                              MUNTZ
                    Follow you? Impossible.      How?

          

                              RUSSELL
                    She likes chocolate.

          
          Russell holds up a chocolate bar to show Muntz.

                                 MUNTZ
                    Chocolate?

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Yeah, I gave her some of my
                    chocolate. She goes ga-ga for it.

          
          Carl swipes the chocolate from Russell and pockets it.

          

                              CARL
                    But it ran off!      It's gone now.

          
          Muntz stares.

          
          He walks to a table full of flight helmets.

          

                                                                   69.

          

          

                              MUNTZ
                    You know, Carl. These people who
                    pass through here, they all tell
                    pretty good stories. A "Surveyor"
                    making a map.
          Using his cane, Muntz topples a helmet from the table.   It
          rolls across the floor.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    A "Botanist" cataloguing plants.

          
          Muntz topples another helmet.
          He lifts a third to show Carl.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    An old man taking his house to
                    Paradise Falls.

          
          He drops the helmet.   It rolls to Carl's feet.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    That's the best one yet. I can't
                    wait to hear how it ends.
          Carl glances around nervously.

          
          Out the window, sitting on the roof of his house, sits THE

          BIRD!

                              CARL
                    Well! It's been a wonderful
                    evening, but we'd better be going.

          
          Carl gets up and pulls Russell from the table.

                              MUNTZ
                    Oh, you're not leaving?

          

                              CARL
                    We don't want to take advantage of
                    your hospitality. Come on Russell.

          
          Carl leads Russell toward the door.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    But we haven't even had dessert
                    yet.

          
          Muntz follows behind them slowly, menacingly.

          

                                                                          70.

          

          

                                MUNTZ
                      No, the boy's right. You haven't
                      had dessert. Epsilon here makes a
                      delicious Cherries Jubilee.

          
          Carl pulls Russell along, Muntz following behind like
          something out of a bad dream.

          

                                MUNTZ
                      Oh, you really must stay. I
                      insist! We have so much more to
                      talk about!

          
          A distant HAUNTED WAIL.         Everyone stops.

          

                                   RUSSELL
                      Kevin?
          Muntz walks to the window and looks out.          Atop the roof he
          sees THE BIRD.

                                   MUNTZ
                      It's here.
          He turns back to Carl... but they're gone.

                                MUNTZ
                          (to dogs)
                      Get them!

          

          INT. CAVE


          
          Carl and Russell untie Carl's house from the pylon.

          

                                   CARL
                      Hurry!

                                RUSSELL
                      I am hurrying!

          
          Dogs descend down the ramp behind them.

                               RUSSELL
                      They're coming!

          
          Carl and Russell run toward the cave opening.
          Dogs block the cave opening.        Carl stops short.

          

                                DUG (O.S.)
                      Master, over here!

          

                                                                         71.

          

          
          Dug points to a tunnel opening deeper inside the cave.     Carl
          and Russell run toward him.

          
          The cave leads to a steep incline.      The dogs are getting
          closer.
          There's no choice but to JUMP.

          
          The lift from the overhead balloons allows Carl and Russell
          to leap down the incline, like astronauts.

                              DUG
                    Go toward the light, master!
          Dogs climb down the rocks, closing in on Carl and Russell.

          
          The bird sees the dogs. She jumps off the house and lifts
          Carl and Russell on her back.
          She runs through the cave, towing the house behind her.
          Russell and Carl HANG ON for dear life.

          
          BANG BANG BANG! Balloons pop as they scrape across the
          ceiling. The house lowers.

          
          Ahead, a giant rock sits in their path. Carl tugs at the
          house but it CRASHES against the rock, pulling Russell onto
          the ground.

                                 CARL
                    Russell!

          
          Dragging on the ground, Russell gets BUMPED around badly.

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, CANYON - CONTINUOUS

          The dogs close in on Russell. Alpha bites at his heels.
          Carl fends off Alpha with his cane.

          

                                 CARL
                    Get back!!
          Alpha is about to bite when an avalanche of boulders rains
          down! The dogs stop short.

          
          Carl looks back as the bird keeps running.      Dug is up on the
          canyon wall. He caused the avalanche!

          

                              DUG
                    Go on Master!       I will stop the
                    dogs!
          Dug jumps down to block the path of the approaching dogs.

          

                                                                        72.

          

          

                               DUG
                    Stop you dogs!!

          
          The dogs run around Dug.

          
          Alpha bites Dug by the neck and throws him out of the path.

          
          The bird carries Carl, Russell dragging along behind.    She
          rounds a corner. Russell SWINGS OUT over the abyss.

          
          The bird jumps from rock spire to spire.   Russell swings back
          and forth wildly in the air.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Help! Help!

          
          Russell does the WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL.

                              CARL
                    Gimme your hand!
          Carl holds out his cane so that Russell can GRAB it and Carl
          PULLS him back onto the bird.
          Meanwhile Dug manages to rejoin his friends, but just in time
          to reach the end of the line -- A CLIFF EDGE.   A river winds
          100 feet below.

          
          Carl looks above to see the house's momentum pulling forward.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Hang on to Kevin!

          
          Carl grabs onto Kevin and picks Dug up by the collar.

          
          Just as the dogs reach our gang, the house's momentum carries
          them across the chasm. Alpha bites the bird on the leg but
          is kicked loose and falls into the river below.

          
          Carl LANDS HARD but safely across the river chasm.     The dogs
          are stuck on the other side.
          Carl painfully gets up.    He looks up at his house.   It's
          still intact.

          
          He breathes a SIGH OF RELIEF.

                              RUSSELL (O.S.)
                    Kevin!

          
          The bird tries to stand but SQUAWKS pitifully and falls back
          to the ground. Russell rushes to her side.

          

                                                                     73.

          

          
          The bird's leg has been injured badly by the dog bite.   She
          can't stand.

          
          Russell applies a bandage.

          
          From the distant labyrinth of rocks, the BIRD BABIES call.
          Kevin CALLS back to them. She tries to stand, but can't.

          
          Russell runs to her side.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    No no no! Kevin! Stay down.
                        (to Carl)
                    She's hurt real bad. Can't we help
                    her get home?

          
          Carl looks at the bird's wounds.   He looks to the rock maze,
          then to his house.
          He knows the right thing to do.    And he hates himself for it.

                               CARL
                    Alright.   But we've got to hurry.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT


          
          Dripping wet dogs cower in front of a menacing Muntz.

                              MUNTZ
                    You lost them?

          

                              BETA
                    Uh, it was Dug.

          

                              GAMMA
                    Yeah, he's with them.    He helped
                    them escape!

          
          Muntz snarls in anger.

          

                               MUNTZ
                    Wait.   Wait a minute.   Dug...

          
          He leans over a RADAR TRACKING DEVICE.

          

                                                              CUT TO:

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS


          
          DUG'S COLLAR SCREEN powers on, and a signal zeroes in on
          Dug's location.

          

                                                                     74.

          

          
          Dug, oblivious, looks out over the landscape, sniffing.

          
          Carl and Russell peek out from behind a tree.

          

                              CARL
                    See anything?

          

                              DUG
                    No, my pack is not following us!
                    Boy they are dumb.
          Dug scampers back to Carl and Russell, who pull the house
          from behind a tree canopy.

                              CARL
                    This is crazy. I finally meet my
                    childhood hero and he's trying to
                    kill us! What a joke.

                              DUG
                    Hey, I know a joke. A squirrel
                    walks up to a tree and says I
                    forgot to store acorns for winter
                    and now I am dead. Ha! It is funny
                    because the squirrel gets dead.
          They pull the house, keeping it hidden behind the trees.

          

                              CARL
                    Careful Russell.
          The house bumps into a tree, jostling the injured BIRD on the
          porch.

                              RUSSELL
                    You okay, Kevin?
          Kevin goes back to sleep.    Russell looks at her BANDAGED LEG.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    You know what, Mr. Fredricksen?
                    The wilderness isn't quite what I
                    expected.

          

                               CARL
                    Yeah?   How so?

                              RUSSELL
                    It's kinda... wild. I mean, it's
                    not how they made it sound in my
                    book.

                              CARL
                    Hmm, get used to that, kid.

          

                                                                    75.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    My dad made it sound so easy. He's
                    really good at camping, and how to
                    make fire from rocks and stuff. He
                    used to come to all my Sweatlodge
                    meetings.

          
          Russell smiles at the thought.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    And afterwards we'd go get ice
                    cream at Fentons. I always get
                    chocolate and he gets butter-
                    brickle. Then we'd sit on this one
                    curb, right outside, and I'll count
                    all the blue cars and he counts all
                    the red ones, and whoever gets the
                    most, wins. I like that curb.
          He looks up at Carl.

                              RUSSELL
                    That might sound boring, but I
                    think the boring stuff is the stuff
                    I remember the most.
          They walk in silence.   Carl understands.

          
          The bird babies CALL OUT in the distance.    Kevin CALLS BACK.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Look, there it is!

          
          Russell spots the labyrinth, now close by.   He tries to run
          but is pulled back by his tether.

          
          LAUGHING, Carl unclips Russell's tether.

                              CARL
                    Hold on Russell, stand still!

          
          Carl ties the hose harnesses to a tree, securing the house.
          Russell helps Kevin off the porch and the group run toward
          the labyrinth entrance.

          
          Kevin is reenergized by the sound of her babies.   She runs
          off ahead. Carl and Russell LAUGH.

          

                              CARL
                    Look at that bird go!

                              CARL
                    Wait up, you overgrown chicken!

          

                                                                      76.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    That's it, go Kevin!      Go find your
                    babies!

          
          Just as they approach the entrance to the labyrinth, a fierce
          spotlight hits them. MUNTZ'S DIRIGIBLE lowers overhead.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Run Kevin! Run!

          
          A net shoots out and binds her. She falls and CALLS OUT.

          

                                RUSSELL
                    Oh no!

          
          The net catches on a rock. Carl and Russell run to her aid.

          

                              CARL
                    Russell, give me your knife!

          
          Carl saws frantically at the net.

          

                              MUNTZ (O.S.)
                    Get away from my bird!

          
          Muntz and his dogs descend from the dirigible.     Beside them,
          a group of dogs drag forward CARL'S HOUSE.

          
          Muntz hurls a lit lantern.      Flames burst up beneath the house.

          
          Heat waves ripple up.   Balloons POP.    Carl's house LOWERS
          into the fire.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS


          
          Inside the living room, Ellie's photo crashes to the floor.

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, LABYRINTH GATE - CONTINUOUS


          

                                CARL
                    No!

          
          Carl panics.    He rushes toward the house, dropping the knife.

          
          Muntz motions to the dogs. They swarm past Russell, knocking
          him down and grabbing the bird in the net.

          

                                RUSSELL
                    No!
          Carl pulls his house away from the flames.

          

                                                                     77.

          

          
          The bird CALLS OUT plaintively as the dogs drag her into the
          dirigible.

          
          Muntz follows the bird up the ramp of the dirigible.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Careful. We want her in good shape
                    for my return.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Let her go! Stop!

          
          Russell runs after the dogs, but the gangplank closes.
          The dirigible flies off.

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Kevin!
          Carl beats out the flames with his jacket.     He extinguishes
          the flames.

          
          Carl collapses on the side of his house.

                              RUSSELL
                    You gave away Kevin.   You just gave
                    her away.

          

                              CARL
                    This is none of my concern.      I
                    didn't ask for any of this!

          

                               DUG
                    Master.   It's alright.

          

                              CARL
                    I am not your master! And if you
                    hadn't a shown up, none of this
                    would have happened! Bad dog! Bad
                    dog!

          
          Dug slinks off, tail between his legs.
          Carl angrily puts on the harness.

          

                              CARL
                    Now, whether you assist me or not,
                    I am going to Paradise Falls if it
                    kills me.

          
          He walks off.   Russell falls in behind.
          An angry dawn breaks.

          

                                                                    78.

          

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, ROCKY TERRAIN - DAY


          
          Now barely aloft, Carl pulls the house across the rocky
          landscape.

          
          Russell's harness drags along side, empty.

          
          Russell walks behind.

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN HILLSIDE - MORNING


          
          With the last of his energy, Carl drags the house into place.
          The house groans as it comes to rest.

          
          Carl drops the hose harness and walks to the edge of a cliff.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS - MORNING


          
          He looks over. He's finally made it: Paradise Falls.
          Torrents of water careen over the massive cliff edge.

          
          Carl takes out Ellie's childhood drawing.    Next to him stands
          the real house, just like Ellie wanted.

                                RUSSELL (O.S.)
                    Here.
          Behind him, Russell throws his sash on the ground.

                              RUSSELL
                    I don't want this anymore.
          Russell walks away.   He sits on a rock, alone.

          
          Carl picks up the sash.   He walks up the steps of his house.

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          The door opens. Carl steps in.   He's back in his house for
          the first time in days.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Carl and Ellie's things are strewn across the floor, a mess
          from the rough journey.

          
          Carl rights Ellie's chair, sets the lamp upright, slides the
          table into position.
          He pushes their two chairs back into their place.

          

                                                                   79.

          

          
          Carl closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and sits.

          
          Quiet.

          
          Nothing, save the distant sound of the falls outside.
          Carl surveys the room.

          
          The ADVENTURE BOOK rests on a table near him.   He opens it
          and puts Ellie's drawing back.
          He looks through the pages, remembering the newspaper
          clippings and old photographs, the dreams of young Ellie.
          He turns to the page marked: STUFF I'M GOING TO DO.

          
          Carl sighs. He managed to bring the house to the falls, but
          Ellie never made it.
          He closes the book.   But as he does, Carl sees something he
          hadn't before.

          
          The blank pages at the end are no longer blank.
          A WEDDING PHOTO of the two of them.
          On a picnic. Celebrating birthdays. Another and another...
          photos of their ordinary life together, the ups and downs.
          Carl's face warms. Ellie lived the life she wanted: she saw
          adventure in everyday life.

          
          A photo of the two of them sitting side by side, together, in
          their chairs. Beneath it, Ellie has written:

          

             "THANKS FOR THE ADVENTURE -- NOW GO HAVE A NEW ONE!

             LOVE, ELLIE."
          Carl smiles.

          
          He looks over to Ellie's empty chair.   On the arm is
          Russell's sash. Carl picks it up.
          He looks to Ellie's chair.

          
          He crosses his heart.

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER


          
          Carl walks from the house and calls from the porch.

                                CARL
                    Russell?

          

                                                                     80.

          

          
          But Russell is nowhere to be seen.

          
          A shadow crosses Carl. He looks up to see Russell floating
          off, hanging from a BUNCH OF BALLOONS.

          

                               CARL
                    Russell!

          

                              RUSSELL
                    I'm gonna help Kevin even if you
                    won't!

          
          Russell fires up a LEAF BLOWER and steers himself off into
          the sky.

          

                              CARL
                    No, Russell! No!
          Carl runs back to his house and tries in desperation to lift
          it. He struggles, but the house doesn't budge. The balloons
          have lost too much helium.

          
          Furious, he THROWS a chair off his porch.    It lands atop the
          mountain rocks with a thud.

          
          This gives him an idea.

          

                                                              CUT TO:
          The GRAMOPHONE smashes onto the rocky ground. Chairs,
          dressers, tables; Carl throws them all out of the house.

          
          Slowly, one corner of the house lifts.   Then another.
          Carl struggles to push a refrigerator from the porch.    It
          teeters... and falls. The house lifts off!

                               CARL
                    Wahhoo!

          
          The house floats off into the sky, leaving a huge pile of
          things. Beside it sits Carl and Ellie's chairs, side by side
          atop Paradise Falls.

          

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING

          The house soars into the air, sails billowing.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM

          Inside the house, Carl adjusts his steering, scans the skies.

          

                                                                    81.

          

          
          KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.    Carl's eyes go wide.

          

                                 CARL
                    Russell?

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - CONTINUOUS


          
          The door swings open.

          

                                 CARL
                    Dug!

          

                              DUG
                    I was hiding under your porch
                    because I love you. Can I stay?

          

                              CARL
                    Can you stay? Well, you're my dog
                    aren't you? And I'm your master!

                              DUG
                    You are my master?!
          Dug lunges forward and overwhelms Carl with dog kisses.

                                 DUG
                    Oh boy.     Oh boy!

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING - CONTINUOUS


          
          The house flies off into the sky.

                              CARL (O.S.)
                    Good boy, Dug. You're a good boy!

          

          EXT. OPEN SKY - DAY


          
          Russell steers through the clouds toward the DIRIGIBLE.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE - CONTINUOUS


          
          Dogs play poker. Behind them, Russell flies past with the
          leaf blower. They turn to look.

          

          EXT. DIRIGIBLE


          
          Russell steers wobbly toward an open dirigible window.    He
          smashes into the wall.

          

                                                                     82.

          

          

                                 RUSSELL
                    Ooph!

          
          He tries again and TUMBLES through the window.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE - CONTINUOUS


          
          Russell releases the balloons and picks up the leaf blower,
          ready for action.

                                RUSSELL
                    Yes!    Don't worry Kevin! I'll save -
          Growling dogs move toward him.

          
          Russell blows the leaf blower at the dogs.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, CAGE ROOM

          Muntz stares into the bird's cage, mesmerized.     She's
          miserable and scared.

                              MUNTZ
                    And they wouldn't believe me. Just
                    wait till they get a look at you.

          
          Alpha enters.

          

                              ALPHA
                    Master! The small mailman has
                    returned.

                                 MUNTZ
                    What?

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE


          
          Dogs tie Russell to a chair.

                                 RUSSELL
                    Let me go!

          
          Muntz enters.

                              MUNTZ
                    Where's your elderly friend?

          
          Russell blows the leaf blower in Muntz's face.

                              RUSSELL
                    He's not my friend anymore.

          

                                                                    83.

          

          
          Muntz grabs the leaf blower and drags Russell out.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Well, if you're here, Fredricksen
                    can't be far behind.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, TROPHY ROOM


          
          Muntz drags Russell through the trophy room.

                              RUSSELL
                    Where are you keeping Kevin!?

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, RAMP ROOM - CONTINUOUS


          
          Muntz sets Russell down and walks to a control panel.

                                 RUSSELL
                    Let me go!

          

                              BETA
                    Scream all you want, small mailman.

          

                              GAMMA
                    None of your mailman friends can
                    hear you.

                              RUSSELL
                    I'll unleash all my Wilderness
                    Explorer training!

          
          Muntz is about to throw a switch when he looks out the
          porthole. Flying toward him is CARL'S HOUSE!

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Alpha! Fredricksen's coming back.
                    Guard that bird. If you see the
                    old man, you know what to do.

          
          Muntz pulls the switch and walks out of the room.

                              RUSSELL
                    Hey, where are you going?    I'm not
                    finished with you!

                              MUNTZ
                    Nice talking with you.

          
          Muntz slams the door.
          Light emerges from the floor.    Russell is on the ramp, which
          is opening. Russell REACTS.

          

                                                                    84.

          

          

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT


          
          Muntz enters the cockpit and takes the wheel.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Where are you, Fredricksen?

          

          EXT. DIRIGIBLE


          
          The dirigible turns, revealing Carl's house sneaking up
          behind.

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM


          
          Carl steers toward the cockpit. He dons Russell's sash, then
          hooks his cane onto his back. He's fighting for a cause.
          He hears SCREAMING. It's Russell! Tied to his chair, he
          slides down the ramp as it lowers, closer and closer to the
          edge.

          

                               CARL
                    Russell!
          Carl steers his house to the dirigible.

          

          

          EXT. DIRIGIBLE, RAMP - CONTINUOUS

          Carl flings the hose, HOOKING it to the ramp railing. Using
          his cane as a zip line, Carl slides to Russell, catching him
          just as Russell slides off the ramp edge. They land safely
          together.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Mr. Fredricksen!

          

                               CARL
                    Dug!   Bring `er over!
          Dug winches in the hose caddy, pulling the house closer to
          the dirigible ramp.

          
          Carl carries Russell into the house.

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS


          
          Carl sets Russell, still bound, down in the front hall.

          

                                                                     85.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    You came back for Kevin!     Let's go
                    get her.

          

                              CARL
                    I'm getting Kevin.    You stay here!

          

                              RUSSELL
                    But I want to help!

          

                              CARL
                    I don't want your help.     I want you
                    safe!
          Carl leaps back into the dirigible.    Dug follows.

          
          Russell STRUGGLES against his bonds.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, HALLWAY


          
          Carl and Dug sneak down a hall. They see dogs ahead and hide.

                              CARL
                    How do we get past these dogs?

                              DUG
                    Uh... POINT!
          Dug points to a grate in the wall.

          

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, GAS CELL AREA

          Dug leads Carl "backstage" through a vent shaft into the
          dirigible. They sneak past two biplanes.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, CAGE ROOM


          
          They emerge through a grate near the ceiling. They look down
          into the room where the bird is kept in a cage.

                              CARL
                    Kevin!

          
          The bird recognizes Carl and CRIES OUT.

                              CARL
                    Don't worry Kevin, we're on our
                    way!
          Alpha enters, leading a group of dogs. Carl and Dug duck
          into the shadows and watch unnoticed from above.

          

                                                                       86.

                    Allow no one to be entering through
                    these doors. Guard well that bird,
                    my minions.

          

                              CARL

                        (WHISPERS)
                    What do we do now, Dug?

          
          Dug is lost in ecstacy, chomping on a tennis ball on the end
          of Carl's cane.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, CAGE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER


          
          Carl drops down from the ceiling and stands on the cage.      He
          bangs his cane. All the dogs turn.
          He grabs a ball from his cane and waves it in the air.

          

                              CARL
                    Who wants the ball?

          

                              DOGS
                    Me! I do! I want the ball!

                              CARL
                    Then go get it!
          Carl throws the ball.    The dogs scramble after it.

          

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF CAGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          The dogs pile into the hallway in pursuit.

          

                              DOGS
                    I'm gonna get there first! Oh gonna
                    get the ball! I'm gonna get it!

          
          Gamma catches it..

                                 GAMMA
                    I got it!!

          
          Behind them Carl shuts the door.    The dogs realize their
          mistake.

                                 GAMMA
                    Uh-oh.

                    I'm sorry Kevin.      Let's get you out
                    of here.

          

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT

          Muntz scans the horizon.    Suddenly the in-ship communicator
          comes to life.

                              DOG WALLA

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FRONT PORCH

          Russell STRUGGLES to break free of the chair.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    I want to help!
          He manages to get his arms free.

          

                                RUSSELL
                    Ha ha!

          
          Except that all his struggling causes the chair to hop out on
          the porch and fall off.

          
          Russell SCREAMS as he falls.     The hose unspools.

          
          Russell reaches the end of the hose. Russell grabs onto it
          and the chair jostles free, falling thousands of feet down.

          
          The house drifts away from the dirigible.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT


          
          The melee of conflicting reports from the dogs continues.

                    Does anyone know where they are?!?!

          
          On cue, Russell SPLATS into the dashboard window of the
          control room and SQUEEGEES across, dangling from the hose.
          Muntz stares, slack-jawed.

                                 RUSSELL
                    Whoooaaah!

          
          The house floats off.

          Russell clings to the end of the hose, swaying in the wind.

          
          What's that noise?   From beneath the dirigible emerges...

          

          EXT. OPEN SKY - CONTINUOUS


          
          From beneath the dirigible, three spitfire airplanes emerge.
          As they get closer, it is clear they are being flown by DOGS.

          Russell SCREAMS, swaying beneath it on the hose.

          

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, TROPHY ROOM

          Carl, Dug and the bird escape through the trophy room.

          

                                                                       89.

                      Come on, Kevin.

          
          Behind the door, Muntz is waiting for them.       He grabs a sword
          from the wall display and attacks.
          Dug hears and BITES Muntz on the leg.

          
          Muntz kicks Dug loose and out the door.    He slams it shut.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, OUTSIDE OF TROPHY ROOM - CONTINUOUS


          
          Locked out, Dug jumps on the door and barks.

          
          He hears growling and turns around.    There stands Alpha and
          the other dogs.

                                 DUG
                      Hi.

          

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, HALLWAY

          Dug runs.   The dogs give chase.

          

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, TROPHY ROOM

          Muntz swings his sword at Carl but misses.    Carl uses his
          cane to defend himself.

          

          OLD MAN SWORD FIGHT!
          Muntz smashes his trophy collection as he swings for Carl.
          His sword gets stuck in a mounted skeleton.
          Carl swings his cane and hits Muntz on the head. The tennis
          balls bounce the cane off Muntz and smack Carl in the face.

          
          Muntz pulls the sword free. He raises the sword over his
          head to strike and his back CRACKS loudly. He's stuck! Carl
          raises his cane over his head and his back CRACKS too.

          
          Carl and Muntz STRUGGLE to move. Muntz CRACKS his back free
          and kicks Carl in the chest, knocking him against a trophy.
          He has the upper hand now. He throttles him with his arm and
          lifts his sword.

          

                                MUNTZ
                      Any last words, Fredricksen?   Come
                      on, spit it out!
          Carl spits his FALSE TEETH at Muntz.    He falls backwards.

          

                                                                        90.

          

          
          Carl collects his teeth and motions for Kevin.

          

                                 CARL
                    Come on!

          
          Muntz advances on Carl, who struggles to protect the bird.

          
          Muntz is a wild man now, smashing and destroying anything
          that gets in his way.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Enough! I'm taking that bird back
                    with me alive or dead!
          Carl trips and falls to the floor.     Muntz is about to deal
          the final blow.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT


          
          Meanwhile Alpha backs Dug into the control panel.        He bumps a
          a LEVER.

          The entire dirigible rocks wildly to the side.

          

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, TROPHY ROOM

          Muntz is knocked off balance.     He slides to one side.    Trophy
          cases slide after him.
          The dirigible tilts to the other side.

          
          The broken trophy cases barrel straight toward Carl!
          Carl is thrown into a window which bursts open. Carl falls
          through but manages to grab the frame with his cane. He
          dangles out over open air.
          He sees the biplanes circling the house, Russell hanging
          beneath it.

          
          The ship corrects again.      Carl climbs back inside.
          Muntz comes at Carl.

          

                              CARL
                    Come on, Kevin!

          EXT. SIDE OF DIRIGIBLE - CONTINUOUS


          
          Carl climbs the work ladder up the side of the dirigible.    He
          pushes the bird along as he goes.

          
          Muntz follows up.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT


          
          Alpha throws Dug viciously across the room. Alpha throws him
          again and Dug crashes into the steering wheel, knocking a
          radar shade off the control panel.
          Alpha moves in.     Dug hides behind the steering wheel.

          

                              ALPHA
                    I will have many enjoyments for
                    what I am about to do, Dug.

          
          Alpha lunges at Dug through the steering wheel.    Dug cowers,
          but then notices the RADAR SHADE.

          
          As Alpha lunges again, Dug jams the shade over Alpha's head.
          Alpha's head is stuck, trapped by the cone.
          The dogs all GASP.

          

                              MISC DOG
                    He wears the Cone of Shame!

                    What? Do not just continue
                    sitting! Attack!

          
          The bump caused his collar to go funny again.    The dogs all
          howl with laughter.

          

                              ALPHA
                        (high pitched voice)
                    No! No! Stop your laughing! Get
                    this off of me!

          

                              DUG
                    Listen you dog!     Sit!
          Surprised at Dug's moxy, Alpha sits.    All other dogs sit too.

          

                              DOG WALLA
                    Yes, Alpha.

          Russell TRIES TO CLIMB the hose.   His hands are about to give
          out.
          The biplanes head straight at Russell.

                        (out of breath)

          Behind him, Carl is climbing the side of the dirigible for
          dear life, Muntz closing in.

                                RUSSELL
                    Huh?

          
          Carl calls for help: the WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL.

          He's more machine than boy now. Biplanes shooting the whole
          way, he climbs up onto the porch.
          The biplanes close in.

          
          Russell yells to them.

          Carl climbs. Muntz grabs Carl's foot. Carl defends himself
          with his cane, knocking Muntz off the ladder. Muntz catches
          on to a rung of the ladder.

          
          He watches Carl and the bird climb.

          
          Muntz descends the ladder.

          Carl and the bird make it to the top of the dirigible.
          Suddenly, a trap door opens. Carl GASPS... but it's Dug!

          

                               CARL
                     Dug!
          Dug jumps up on Carl, licking his face.

                     Master!
          The house bears down on them.    They run to meet it.

          

                               CARL
                     Russell!! Over here!!    Let's go!

          
          Russell steers the house toward Carl.

                               RUSSELL
                     Mr. Fredricksen!

          
          The house slows and lowers atop the airship.    Carl HOISTS the
          bird up onto the porch.

          

                               CARL
                     Come on, Kevin!
          Carl helps Dug onto the porch.   He climbs up himself...

          
          BLAM!   Muntz appears on top of the dirigible with a rifle!

          
          A bullet blasts through Carl's balloon strings. A third of
          them break or shoot skyward. The house plummets, crashing
          onto the dirigible.

          

                                                                     94.

          

          
          Carl is THROWN from the house onto the airship.

          
          The house slides toward the edge, Russell, Dug and Kevin
          still inside.

          

                                 CARL
                      No!

          
          Carl SCRAMBLES to grab the hose trailing from the sliding
          house. The house slides on to the dirigible's tail fin.
          Holding the hose, Carl digs in his heels and is just able to
          stop it.

          
          The house teeters on the very edge of the tail fin.

          

                                CARL
                     Russell!   Get out of there!
          Russell, Dug and Kevin run toward the front porch.

          
          BLAM!   A bullet smashes the door jam next to them.

          
          Muntz storms toward the house.    Carl holds desperately to the
          hose.

          

                                 CARL
                     No!    Leave them alone!

          
          Russell and others duck inside and slam the door.

          
          The house tilts, threatening to tip off at any second.   Carl
          holds on for his life.

          
          Muntz POUNDS on the door with the butt of the rifle.

          Carl struggles to hold on. The hose caddy is ripping free
          from the house! The bolts pop from the wooden siding... it's
          about to go!

                                CARL
                      Russell! Hang on to Kevin! Don't

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM

          Confused, Russell follows Carl's directions.   He Dug and the
          bird huddle together.

          
          Muntz breaks through the door.    He lifts his rifle and sights
          the bird...
          Through the window, Carl yells out.

          Muntz lunges after them.

          Kevin leaps through the window, Russell and Dug hanging from

          Muntz leaps after them.
          But balloon strings tangle around his leg and pull him back.

          
          Muntz hangs for a moment... It's thousands of feet from the
          ground....
          He falls.

          The hose curves beneath the tail fin.    Finally it swings
          out...

          

                              RUSSELL
                    That was cool!
          Russell and Dug dangle from it, sitting on Kevin.     The bird
          holds on to the hose with her beak.
          Carl LAUGHS, relieved.

          

                              CARL
                    Don't jerk around so much, kid!
          Russell climbs up, followed by the bird and Dug.

                              DUG
                    Oh I am ready to not be up high.
          Carl LAUGHS heartily as Dug jumps on him and licks his face.
          Carl looks into the distance. His house, now empty, floats
          softly down into the clouds, and disappears.

                              RUSSELL
                    Sorry about your house, Mr.
                    Fredricksen.

          
          Carl smiles.   He puts his arm around Russell.

          

                              CARL
                    You know, it's just a house.
          Carl, Russell, Dug and Kevin stand on the tail of the airship
          floating off over the clouds.

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, LABYRINTH GATE - AFTERNOON


          
          Carl and Russell hold and cuddle the baby birds.     The babies
          peck at Carl's head. Carl and Russell LAUGH.

          

                              CARL
                    Ow! Ow! Ow!

                              RUSSELL
                    Look at you. You're so soft.

          

                                                                       97.

          

          
          Kevin CALLS OUT, waiting for the babies at the gate to the
          LABYRINTH. Time to go.

          

                              CARL/RUSSELL

                        (DISAPPOINTED)
                    Awwww!

          

                              RUSSELL
                    I wish I could keep one.

          
          The babies run to the bird.      One stops to HISS at Dug.

          
          Carl has misplaced something.

                               CARL
                    Huh, where's my cane?      I just had
                    it here...
          Kevin starts HACKING.    She COUGHS up the cane.

          
          Babies start HACKING too.     They COUGH up tennis balls.

          

                              CARL
                    You know what? Keep `em.       A little
                    gift from me to you.
          The bird family enters the labyrinth.     Carl and Russell wave.

          

                                 RUSSELL
                    Bye Kevin!
          The bird looks back toward Carl and Russell and CALLS OUT one
          last time before disappearing into the mist.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT - LATER

          Carl and Russell both wear matching leather flight helmets
          and goggles.

          

                                 RUSSELL
                    Ready?
          Carl gives a thumbs up.

          

                                 CARL
                    Ready!

          Muntz's dirigible ascends into the sky. Dug and all of
          MUNTZ'S DOGS stick their heads out the dirigible windows,
          barking as they fly into the sunset.

          Each Junior Wilderness Explorer stands next to his father.
          As the Camp Master announces the achievement he hands the
          father a badge, who pins it to his son's sash.

          The Camp Master CLEARS HIS THROAT uncomfortably.   Russell
          looks for his dad in the audience.

          Carl takes his place next to Russell.

                        (to Camp Master)

                    award you the highest honor I can
                    bestow: The Ellie Badge.

          
          Carl pins the badge onto the missing spot on Russell's sash.
          It's Ellie's GRAPE SODA PIN.

          

                                RUSSELL
                    Wow.

          
          Carl smiles.

          
          They salute each other.      Russell gives Carl a hug.   Carl
          returns it.
          Russell's mom sits in the audience with Dug.     Russell proudly
          shows her the badge.

                               CAMP MASTER STRAUCH

               Pitch black. Dead quiet. Dim faint light appears in the

               SLOWLY TRACKING down a long line of couples. Some with kids, 
               some old, some young, all waiting to pay their $55 and pick 
               up their marriage license.

               We HOLD on a young couple, late 20's, KEITH FISHER and his 
               fiancee, LIZ GARRETY. Fisher has a blondish quality to him, 
               unassuming, pleasant, attentive, a bit more reactive than he 
               could be. Liz is quite attractive, but somewhat tense, and 
               not at all happy about having to stand in this very slow 
               moving line.

                                     LIZ
                         This is ridiculous.

                         I don't think so.

               In front of them a middle-aged MEXICAN COUPLE make-out

               Liz pulls a note-pad out of her daypack.

                         I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure 
                         what all of them are.

               A YOUNG TEENAGE COUPLE behind them stares at Liz, a bit 
               confused.

                         It's a bachelor party. You sort of 
                         have to do it before the wedding.

               EXT. SANTA MONICA

               TIGHT ON a "Fred Sands" realty sign being pounded into the 
               ground. Pictured on the sign, as "offered by," is realtor 
               DAVID BOYD, 30-ish, short hair, smiling with bizarre 
               sincerity.

               WIDER to reveal, David Boyd in the flesh, suit jacket off, 
               pounding away, sinking the sign into the front yard of a 
               cute little house. His CELL PHONE RINGS. Boyd, gets the phone 
               from his jacket.

                                     BOYD
                              (into phone)
                         David Boyd. Tina. Great. Okay. Here's 
                         the deal, we're talking five guys. 
                         Hard Rock. Nice guys Tina. My friends. 
                         Yeah. I'm calling you directly so 
                         you don't have to go through the 
                         agency...
                              (suddenly, over his 
                              shoulder)
                         HEY! DO NOT ENTER THE HOUSE!
                              (back into phone)
                         That's correct. Cash straight to 
                         you. Yes. Twelve hundred? I don't 
                         think so. It's just stripping. Just 
                         a show. Hold on.
                              (O.C.)
                         Could you please wait off the 
                         property?

               ANGLE ON A YOUNG COUPLE, obviously here to see the house.

                         We're just trying to sneak a peak.

                                     BOYD
                         Just stay off the property until I'm 
                         off the phone.

                                     MAN
                         Why?

                                     BOYD
                         Cause that's the way they do it.

               Bewildered and somewhat intimidated, they back off.

                                     BOYD
                              (back into phone)
                         So it's five guys, Hard Rock Casino. 
                         Nine hundred bucks and you do the 
                         thing with the rubber hoses. Are you 
                         in? Tina, are you in? Good.

               Boyd hangs up, puts on his jacket and turns with the same 
               bizarre insincere smile in his photo. Hand extended...

                                     BOYD
                         David Boyd, nice to meet you.

               Late twenties, a chef in a very upscale, very busy KITCHEN.

                                     LIZ
                         Why? What's his problem?

                                     FISHER
                         He's a great chef.

                                     LIZ
                         He's weird. And I expect more from 
                         you.

                                     FISHER
                         You expect more what?

                                     LIZ
                         You're going to be hungover for three 
                         days. Like those guys on "Oprah" 
                         that get drunk and have disgusting 
                         sex with prostitutes and then say 
                         their vows with the stench of cheap 
                         hotel whore sex all over them.

                                     FISHER
                         Time out.

                                     LIZ
                         It's vile!

               People are staring.

                                     FISHER
                         That's absurd.

                                     LIZ
                         I've seen it on television.

                                     FISHER
                         I'm not going to marry you with the 
                         smell of prostitutes on my body.

                                     LIZ
                              (starts to cry)
                         I am not common Keith. I am not 
                         common. I am a creature like no other 
                         and I will not be commoned! Is that 
                         to much to ask?
                              (screaming)
                         Is that to much to ask!?!

                                     FISHER
                         You will not be common!!!

               Finally, at the head of the line, Liz steps up to the clerk.

                                     LIZ
                         Marriage license please.

               EXT. GOVERNMENT BUILDING

               Fisher and Liz emerge, start for the parking lot. Liz stops 
               to look at Fisher, her eyes well with tears, vulnerable and 
               apologetic.

                                     LIZ
                         Do you love me?

                                     FISHER
                         Of course.

                                     LIZ
                         How much?

                                     FISHER
                         With all my heart.

                                     LIZ
                              (vulnerable)
                         Kiss me...?

               FISHER takes her into his arms, pulls her to him, kisses her 
               hard, for all it's worth.

               INT. A LARGE MONEY MANAGEMENT FIRM

               Desk after desk after desk of identical men, seemingly 
               repeating the same task. We find Fisher at one of the desks, 
               number crunching. At the desk across from Fisher sits...

               MICHAEL BRENN, short, compact, with a severe personality 
               disorder, masquerading as semi-appropriate behavior.

                                     MICHAEL
                         That's just insecurity.

                                     FISHER
                         I don't know. She's really been 
                         stressing out.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut 
                         splinters.

                                     FISHER
                         What does that mean?

                                     MICHAEL
                         It means she's insecure.

                                     FISHER
                         About what?

               Michael's phone rings.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (picks up)

                         I'm amazed the windows don't blow 
                         out of their fucking sockets with 
                         all the repressed, ass-puckering 
                         rage in these soul-less lizards.

                                     FISHER
                              (beat)
                         I just want her to be happy.

                         Same shower, towel, toothbrush, razor, 
                         hair gel. It's a fucking epidemic 
                         Fisher and you better start addressing 
                         it. You're getting married and I'm 
                         not going to candy-coat it. It just 
                         gets worse. It's an eighteen wheel 
                         cement mixer that will crush every 
                         bone in your body.

               Fisher looks pale.

                         I'm not breathing right.

                                     MICHAEL
                         You're not breathing right?

                                     FISHER
                         Lately I'll just start getting 
                         lightheaded, dizzy, and I realize I 
                         haven't breathed in like two minutes.

               ADAM BRENN, Michael's older brother, mid-30's, a bit soft in 
               the belly, approaches, more or less in charge.

                         hours. If you want to come, get your 
                         numbers in order by then.

                         No first of all. I'm not in a game 
                         mood.

                                     MICHAEL
                         You're interrupting a personal 
                         conversation.

                         I know you'll be.
                              (to Michael)
                         Three hours.

               Adam goes.

                         I don't care for him.

                                     FISHER
                         He's your brother.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Liz sits at the kitchen table, in a mild panic.

                                     LIZ
                              (into phone)
                         We've got problems here.

                         Problems?

               INTERCUT Liz and Fisher.

                                     LIZ
                         Seating problems.

                                     FISHER
                         Okay.

                                     LIZ
                         Keith do not trivialize this.

                                     FISHER
                         I'm not. What's the problem?

                                     LIZ
                         We're supposed to have gold-trimmed 
                         padded seats, now they're telling me 
                         that there was a mistake and we can't 
                         have padded.

                                     FISHER
                         What kind of seats can we have?

                         Not padded ones.

                                     FISHER
                         So what do we do?

                                     LIZ
                         You go down there.

                                     FISHER
                         Go down where?

                                     LIZ
                         Go down to the seat place and 
                         straighten this out.

                                     FISHER

               Lois clicks off photos of the men.

                                     LOIS
                         All right. As you were.

               The guys break. Fisher goes to Liz.

                         Will you please call the chair people?

                         Have a nice bachelor party.

               Adam kisses Lois and the kids goodbye. Adam Jr. nearly looses 
               his balance in the excitement, Adam catches him.

               Boyd starts to get in the drivers seat.

                                     ADAM
                         Not on your life.

               Boyd slides over shotgun, cranks the MUSIC. Fisher's the 
               last one in. He slides the big Minivan door shut and they're 
               off.

               Adam looks in the rearview mirror, Lois, Liz, Timmy wave 
               goodbye. Adam Jr. waves one of his crutches.

               EXT. HWY - SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY

               The minivan cruises east: from Santa Monica; through downtown 
               Los Angeles; and the City of Industry. At the turn off, a 
               freeway sign reads; "Las Vegas 385 miles."

               INT. MINIVAN - LATER

                                     BOYD
                         You're a fucking moron.

                                     MICHAEL
                         It's my fucking opinion.

                                     ADAM
                         It's really a stupid opinion. You 
                         have developed an annoying habit of 
                         talking for what seems to be no other 
                         reason than to hear yourself speak.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Because my opinion threatens yours, 
                         it's poorly developed?

                                     ADAM
                         No, because your opinions are idiotic 
                         and have nothing to do with what any 
                         given conversation is about, which 
                         makes 85% of your eagerly injected 
                         thought process highly offensive to 
                         me.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Boyd brought up divorce statistics.

                                     BOYD
                         The hell I did!

                                     MICHAEL
                         The hell you didn't!

                                     BOYD
                         The hell I did!

                                     MICHAEL
                         You said one in two marriages end in 
                         divorce.

                                     BOYD
                         I never heard that.

                                     FISHER
                         You said that Boyd.

                                     BOYD
                         Well, I didn't mean it.

                                     MICHAEL
                         You're an asshole Adam.

                                     ADAM
                         You're an asshole.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Oh, and why am I an asshole?

                                     ADAM
                         Multiple reasons.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Name one.

                                     ADAM
                         I don't have to...

                                     FISHER
                         SHUT UP!

               DEAD SILENCE. As they ride through the lifeless desert, Fisher 
               dials his cell phone.

                                     FISHER

                         Is this Pico Party rents? Can I speak 
                         to whomever is in charge of chairs? 
                         Chairs.

               Boyd checks his watch.

                         Four hours and fifteen minutes. I 
                         can make Vegas in 3 and change.

                                     ADAM
                         I'm not getting a ticket.

                                     FISHER
                              (on cell phone)
                         Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're 
                         doing my wedding and I'm calling 
                         about the chair situation. Yeah, 
                         I'll hold.

                                     BOYD
                         Who's up for making some real money?

                                     ADAM
                         Don't even start.

                                     BOYD
                         You want to hear me out?

                                     MICHAEL
                         Nope.

                                     BOYD
                         Moore?

                                     MOORE
                         No I don't.

                         Fish?

                                     FISHER
                         Not really.
                              (into phone)
                         Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs...

                              (no response)
                         An acquaintance friend of mine is 
                         professionally involved with a 
                         communications outfit in Denver that 
                         I just happen to know for a fact is 
                         about to be rewarded a very large, 
                         exclusive contract to rewire every 
                         state prison in Colorado. Yes sir.

               Nobody gives a fuck.

                                     FISHER
                              (into phone)
                         No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. 
                         Keith Fisher. Okay.

                                     BOYD
                         That would translate to government 
                         guaranteed contract in excess of 35 
                         million dollars.

                                     FISHER
                              (into phone)
                         We need padded chairs.

                         125% on shares which are currently 
                         sitting around $4.38, or, in plain

                         SHUT UP!

                                     MICHAEL
                         NO!

                                     BOYD
                         What is wrong with you people? I'm a 
                         helper here.

                         Your investment ideas never work 
                         out.

                                     BOYD
                         That's the whole point. They rarely 
                         work out. But on occasion they do. 
                         And when they do, they do big.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Your ideas never work out.

                                     BOYD
                         Oh really? Starbucks?

                                     ADAM
                         That's one idea.

                                     FISHER
                              (into phone)
                         No... we want padded chairs... okay?

                                     BOYD
                         One idea that if you had fucking 
                         listened to, you would each be worth 
                         approximately 15 million dollars.

                                     ADAM
                         You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. 
                         That was your only real hit in like 
                         75 tries.

                                     BOYD
                         I set up Fisher with the broker that 
                         found his house. Took care of that 
                         one, didn't I?

                         I don't think so Boyd.

                                     BOYD
                         Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No 
                         sir.

               He turns away from the guys and stares out the window.

                                     FISHER (O.S.)
                         Yes, I was holding for Tony in chairs. 
                         I have a chair problem. No, I'm not 
                         Tony, I need to speak to Tony.

               The minivan cruises through Death Valley in route to Vegas.

               EXT. RED ROCK NAT'L PARK - CANYON - MAGIC HOUR

               North of Vegas. The minivan is parked high on a cliff 
               overlooking the city. A couple of Tequila bottles on ice, a 
               case of Heineken. The boys are arming up.

                         All the bullshit aside Fish, we've 
                         been coming up here for what, eight 
                         years?

               Boyd, carving a branch with his boy scout knife...

                         They've all been real times. And as 
                         you prepare to enter into a new phase 
                         of life, as you prepare for new roles; 
                         father, husband, teacher, you will, 
                         as I have, come to except the letting 
                         go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing 
                         will begin...

                         Tonight we return once again to the 
                         cave. Tonight we let the monsters 
                         out. We fill ourselves with the 
                         spirits of Genghis Kahn, Joe Namath,

                         I dedicate this evening to fear and 
                         to major loathing. So from sun set 
                         to sun rise, let me be heard...

                         He who acts the beast, rids himself 
                         of the pain of being a man!

               The guys smash the bottles together in an explosion of glass 
               and the golden Tequila.

                         Well, the night is young. Did you 
                         straighten out the chair situation?

                                     FISHER (V.O.)
                         I'm working on it, I've made three 
                         calls.

                         No. No. No. It's what my father said 
                         to me. He said it and he meant it... 
                         He said to me... He said, Adam, he 
                         said... He told me and I heard him... 
                         he said...
                              (struggles to remember)
                         Hell he said so many Goddamn things 
                         I can't remember everything he said 
                         for Christsake.

                                     FISHER
                         Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. 
                         My father said, first of all, I'm 
                         your father not your friend. I'm 
                         your father.

                                     ADAM
                         Are you solid with that?

                                     FISHER
                         No. I think it's fucked.

                                     ADAM
                         Then fuck what your father said, 
                         cause I'm gonna tell you right now... 
                         You'll know what it's all about, why 
                         you got married and why you love her 
                         when you wake up at three in the 
                         morning, and the streetlight's coming 
                         through the window and it's just 
                         catching a corner of her face, like 
                         a sleeping angel. And her hair smells 
                         sweet and she's your's. She's all 
                         your's. Do you see where I'm going 
                         here?

                         If I'm the king of Israel, I say to 
                         myself, King, I say to myself, King... 
                         Take a good look around. What do I 
                         see?

                         Israel doesn't have a King.

                                     BOYD
                         Then what do they have?

                                     MICHAEL
                         They have a president. A Benjamin 
                         Yahoo something.

                                     BOYD
                         I say to myself, look at the map. 
                         Look what's all around you. People 
                         who wish bad bad things for you and 
                         your people. For thousands of years 
                         the Jews are fighting everybody. It 
                         used to be they'd throw rocks, then 
                         the iron revolution and they would 
                         attack with spears. Then the gunpowder 
                         revolution. Now they're shooting 
                         fire power back and forth, all day 
                         bullets flying, babies getting shot.

                         What's your point?

                                     BOYD
                         Now if I'm the King of Israel and 
                         all these sand niggers are armed to 
                         the gills and you know it's just a 
                         matter of time... right? Am I right?

                                     MICHAEL
                         The Israelis can protect themselves. 
                         They got the Mossad thing happening. 
                         Mossad's for real, man. They scalp 
                         babies.

                         There's my point exactly.

                                     MICHAEL
                         What? What's your point?

                         What?

                         The Mexicans would love it. They're 
                         dying for a little order down there. 
                         They need direction.

                                     MICHAEL
                         They need leadership.

                                     BOYD
                         That's what I'm saying. Let the 
                         Israelis straighten it up. They got 
                         plenty of room down there, number 
                         one. Plus, and this is just a plus, 
                         they kind of look alike -- the Jews 
                         and the Mexicans. So I think on a 
                         whole your average Joe Mexican is 
                         gonna have less of a problem getting 
                         his head around the whole assimilation 
                         thing. Am I right?

                         I tell them they're strong. They 
                         make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So 
                         they really know that I need them 
                         just as much. You know. Just as much 
                         man. And you know, you're their 
                         godfather...

                                     FISHER
                         I know and I'm honored...

                                     ADAM
                         If anything ever happens to me...

                                     FISHER
                         I know...

                                     ADAM
                         Y'see? That's the real point here. 
                         That's what I'm driving for, when 
                         the big storm comes and knocks down 
                         all the forests and the rocks fall 
                         down and the leave's are bare. What's 
                         left? The little trees, the little 
                         fellas that the storm didn't see. 
                         The tiny little...

               Moore is on the balcony.

                                     MOORE
                         The stripper's here.

                                     ADAM
                              (bombed)
                         Excellent.

               He and Fisher stagger aside.

               HOTEL SUITE

               Boyd introduces TINA, a devastatingly sexy Asian girl, to 
               all the boys.

                                     BOYD
                         Gentlemen, this is Tina.

               The guys, wasted, attempt to greet Tina.

                                     TINA
                         Who's the lucky groom?

               The guys point at Fisher, roaring. Tina presses her lips to 
               Fisher's ear.

                                     TINA
                         Hi Fisher.

               Boyd dims the lights, cranks up the MUSIC as the guys stumble 
               for position on and around the couch. Tina starts to move, 
               very sexy.

               Michael tokes a joint.

                                     MICHAEL
                         God, I love women.

               TINA'S DANCE MONTAGE

               SERIES OF SHOTS:

               TINA dances, slowly peeling off her clothes.

               The guys are into it. Michael seems especially turned-on.

               Tina moves in on Fisher, starts a very nasty lap dance... 
               somehow incorporating a rubber hose.

               The guys hoop and holler...

               Michael is mesmerized...

               Tina grinds on Fisher's lap, touching her nipples...

               Michael's going crazy... He tries to touch her, she slaps 
               his hand away...

               Fisher can't take it anymore...

               Tina relents... moves on...

               Michael reaches for her leg like a dog in heat.

               She passes over him, teasing, tormenting him, and settles 
               onto Adam's lap.

               The guys roar in approval... Michael glowers...

               Adam turns bright red as Tina arouses and rides him...

               Michael starts to burn...

               The guys egg Tina on, she gets off on Adam's shyness, rubs 
               her breasts in his face...

               The guys are howling...

               Tina sucks one of Adam's fingers into her mouth...

               Michael looks like he's going to explode...

               Adam's overwhelmed, he politely bails out...

                                     BOYD
                              (whispers to Fish)
                         She's all your's Fish. Anything you 
                         want. Happy bachelor party.

                                     FISHER
                         I can't.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (jumps up)
                         I'll take a ride.

                                     FISHER
                         Go for it.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (to Tina)
                         Come on.

                                     TINA
                              (to Boyd)
                         You said just dancing.

                                     BOYD
                              (re: money)
                         I'll take good care of you.

                                     TINA
                              (dead flat; re: Michael)
                         With him.
                              (beat)
                         Lucky me.

               Michael moves in on Tina. Hesitantly, she leads him into the 
               master bedroom.

                                     MOORE
                         She's fucking hot!

                                     ADAM
                         I need a drink.

                                     BOYD
                         Tequila...

               Boyd reaches for the bottle as the beat goes on.

               HOTEL SUIT - MONTAGE

               Distorted, a bit crooked. MUSIC and DIALOGUE constantly 
               changing levels. We're not sure who's saying what. We're not 
               sure of physical geography. The one thing we are sure of is 
               that MICHAEL is fucking the hell out of Tina in the bathroom.

               SERIES OF SHOTS:

               MASTER BATHROOM:

               Michael works Tina from behind.

               SUITE:

               MOORE bouncing off the furniture.

               FISHER and ADAM, wildly high.

               BOYD sprays beer on Adam, who returns fire. Drunk they start 
               wrestling, throwing each other around the room, knocking 
               over furniture.

               BATHROOM:

               Michael, tightly, ties Tina's hands behind her back with her 
               rubber hose.

                                     TINA
                         Oh come on.

                                     MICHAEL
                         I want to play.

                                     TINA
                         It's gonna cost extra.

                                     MICHAEL
                         I will pay.

               SUITE:

               Fisher spraying beer all over Adam and Boyd as they knock a 
               table over and end up tangled and brawling on the floor.

               BATHROOM:

               Michael screwing the hell out of Tina.

                                     TINA
                         Easy baby, easy.

               SLOW MOTION INTERCUT:

               SUITE:

               Moore wildly leaps from the couch to the chair, to another 
               chair, back to the couch...

               BATHROOM:

               Michael plows like a monster into Tina, hands tied behind 
               her back...

               CLOSE ON her stiletto heels, digging into the marble floor... 
               One of her heels breaks... she starts to slip...

               SUITE:

               Moore jumps, misses the chair, falling down on the glass 
               coffee table, GLASS EXPLODES...

               BATHROOM:

               Tina falls, Michael reaches too late, she can't break her 
               fall with her hands tied behind her... she's going down...

               SUITE:

               Moore falls through the shattered glass, to the floor...

               BATHROOM:

               Tina hits her head hard on the porcelain toilet...

               SUITE:

               Fisher, Adam, and Boyd stop brawling, stare down at Moore 
               covered in glass.

                                     MOORE
                              (beat)
                         Cool.

               Moore is fine, not even a scratch. The guys break into ROARING 
               LAUGHTER, completely HYSTERICAL; shaking, roaring, releasing. 
               TIGHT SHOTS of each HOWLING until...

               One by one... they sober up... looking O.C.

               TIGHT ON FISHER as his smile slowly fades to confusion, he 
               stares O.C. at...

               MICHAEL

               Standing in the door, face ghost white, blood dripping from 
               his fingers...

                                     MICHAEL
                         I really fucked up.

               INT. BATHROOM

               The guys rush in. Stop dead in their tracks.

               TINA

               On the floor, legs twisted underneath her, lies growing in a 
               growing puddle of dark blood. SILENCE as the guys stare, 
               trying to comprehend.

                                     MOORE
                         Jesus.

                                     ADAM
                         Don't touch her. Call 911.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (in shock)
                         I was just playing... we were playing 
                         just playing around.

                                     ADAM
                              (examines Tina)
                         She's dead.

                                     FISHER
                         No... No.

                                     MOORE
                         How do you know she's dead.

                                     ADAM
                         She's got no fucking pulse.

                                     BOYD
                         You don't know what you're doing.

               Boyd pushes Adam out of the way. Starts feeling her pulse.

                                     BOYD
                              (not getting anything)
                         Where do you look? What side of the 
                         neck?

                                     MOORE
                         Left side.

                                     ADAM
                         Either side you idiot. I'm calling 
                         911.

                                     FISHER
                              (semi-gone)
                         What happened? Oh my God...

                                     MICHAEL
                         We were playing... she slipped... 
                         she hit her head.

                                     ADAM
                              (incredulous)
                         Playing?

               SUITE

               Adam moves into the living room, heads for the phone. Boyd 
               intercepts him. They wrestle for the phone.

                                     BOYD
                         Wait!

                                     ADAM
                         What?

                                     BOYD
                         What are you doing?

                              (hysterical)
                         What are you talking about?

                                     BOYD
                         What do you think you are doing?

                                     ADAM
                         I'm calling the ambulance.

                                     BOYD
                         Just wait a second. Wait one second. 
                         Okay. What are you doing?

                                     ADAM
                         Calling the ambulance.

                                     BOYD
                         Why?
                              (beat)
                         Why? She's dead. Why are you calling 
                         an ambulance?

               A reasonable point. BEAT.

                                     ADAM
                         We have to call the ambulance.

                                     BOYD
                         Why?

               Fisher entering, freaked...

                                     FISHER
                         Oh, Jesus... call the police.

                                     BOYD
                         No.

                                     FISHER
                         She's dead. Call somebody!

                                     BOYD
                         Shut up.

                                     BOYD
                         Shut up.

                                     MICHAEL
                         She slipped.

                                     ADAM
                              (attacking Michael)
                         What did you do?

                                     MICHAEL
                              (defensive)
                         You never heard of accidents?! Get 
                         off me!

               Adam slaps Michael. Moore tries to break it up.

                                     BOYD
                         Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!

               SILENCE.

                                     BOYD
                         Listen to me. Please. Everybody just 
                         calm down a bit here. Okay... First... 
                         are we sure she's dead?

                                     ADAM
                         Her head's bashed in and her heart 
                         isn't beating.

                                     MOORE
                         She's dead.

                                     MICHAEL
                         It was an accident!

                                     BOYD
                         Are you sure this was an accident?

                                     ADAM
                         You're a lying deviant. What did you 
                         do?!

                                     MICHAEL
                         The floor was wet. She slipped!

                                     ADAM
                         Why was the floor wet?

                                     MICHAEL
                         I don't know why the floor was wet!

                                     ADAM
                         Why?!

               Fisher wanders back to the bathroom door where Moore is; 
               they stare down at Tina as the conversation rages in the 
               b.g.

                                     BOYD
                         Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just 
                         take a second here and take hold of 
                         the situation, OK? Let's just review 
                         our options here.

                                     ADAM
                         We have a dead woman bleeding all 
                         over the bathroom. What options? 
                         Call the police.

                                     BOYD
                         Call the police. Okay, that's one 
                         option.

                                     ADAM
                         That is not an "option." There is no 
                         multiple choice here.

                                     BOYD
                         Yes sir, there sure is an option 
                         here. There are always options.

               ON Fisher and Moore.

                                     MOORE
                         I've never seen a dead person.

               As Moore moves in, transfixed, to take a closer look...

                                     FISHER
                              (enraged)
                         Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!

                                     BOYD
                         Well we can definitely call the 
                         police. That's an easy call. If we 
                         call the police... What happens?
                              (silence)
                         They find a dead prostitute in the 
                         bathroom... They ask us... What 
                         happened? We say, ah... our friend, 
                         Michael...
                              (to Adam)
                         Your brother... got a little out of 
                         control... they were making love... 
                         and he got a little excited... and 
                         he, ah, sort of beat her head into 
                         the side of a toilet, while he choked 
                         her to death with a rubber hose...

                                     ADAM
                         Stop it!

                                     BOYD
                         There's more.

                                     ADAM
                         Just stop.

                                     BOYD
                         Just giving the facts.

                                     ADAM
                         I'm calling the police.

                                     BOYD
                         What were we doing officer? Why didn't 
                         we help her? Well... we're all a bit 
                         high, you know, bachelor party, that 
                         kind of thing. Fisher here is getting 
                         married in three days... Beautiful 
                         wife... he didn't have anything at 
                         all to do with it... It was all 
                         Michael here... just Michael...

                                     ADAM
                         You don't play games with Homicide 
                         police. There are no options here. 
                         There is not the luxury of worrying 
                         about how the fallout will settle.

                                     BOYD
                         I've known him for while maybe twenty 
                         years kind of a close friend but hey 
                         what the heck officer, take him away, 
                         go on it's for his own good.

                                     FISHER
                              (outraged)
                         What are you talking about? Adam's 
                         right. We don't have a choice here 
                         Boyd... I mean what are you talking 
                         about? What options???

                                     BOYD
                              (calm)
                         Bury her out in the desert.

                                     ADAM
                              (sarcastic)
                         Sure, why not.

                                     MOORE
                         He's right.

                                     BOYD
                         We can take her out to Red Rock. 
                         Find some quiet place... and put her 
                         in the ground.

                                     ADAM
                         You don't just casually walk out of 
                         a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.

                                     BOYD
                         We can do this. We can get her out 
                         of here.

                                     ADAM
                         Have you completely lost your mind? 
                         So you get her out of here. So you 
                         get her out into the desert somehow, 
                         without anybody seeing, so what, you 
                         don't think at some point somebody 
                         might notice that she's gone?

                                     BOYD
                         Nobody knows she's here. I called 
                         her personally. Nobody knows.

                                     FISHER
                         Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody 
                         must know she's here.

                                     BOYD
                         Nobody knows.

               PAUSE, as the guys digest this point.

                                     ADAM
                         Her blood is all over the bathroom. 
                         I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem.

                                     BOYD
                         It's a marble floor, we can clean it 
                         up.

                                     FISHER
                         Oh God. This is insane.

                                     BOYD
                         What's insane is the fact that Michael 
                         here put a fucking girl's head through 
                         a toilet. That's insane.

                                     MOORE
                         They'll get us on accessory to murder.

                                     ADAM
                         Bullshit it's not accessory. I didn't 
                         do shit. You call the cops, you 
                         explain it was an accident...

                                     BOYD
                         Her fucking head was caved in.

                                     ADAM
                         So! I didn't fucking do it!

                                     BOYD
                         She's got bondage burns on her wrists. 
                         There's blow all over the room, Moore 
                         looks like he went at it with a 
                         mountain lion. This room looks like 
                         the Manson Family stayed here a month. 
                         Michael goes down, we all go down.

                                     MOORE
                         I'm not going to ruin my life over a 
                         dead whore.

                                     ADAM
                         That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead 
                         whore?" She's a person!

                                     FISHER
                              (falling away)
                         I'm getting married...

                                     MICHAEL
                         I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

                                     ADAM
                         I've got a wife and two boys.

               Fisher shuffles to a corner, collapses, head in hands. 
               SILENCE.

                                     BOYD
                              (unflappably calm)
                         Lets take a vote. A simple vote. Two 
                         choices; we clean up the mess. Right 
                         now. Bury it in the desert, go home, 
                         and never look back. Or, we can call 
                         the police... Open those doors, roll 
                         the dice and hope that it's only 
                         Michael who falls. Let's take a vote. 
                         Desert... or police?

               BOYD looks around. BEAT. Raises his hand.

                                     BOYD
                         Desert.

               He looks at MOORE.

                                     MOORE
                              (beat)
                         Fucking desert.

               MICHAEL

                                     MICHAEL
                              (to Fisher)
                         Fish, I'm really sorry. I just... I 
                         owe you man.
                              (puts up his hand)
                         Desert.

               All eyes on FISHER, no response.

                                     BOYD
                         Nobody knows she's here.

                                     FISHER
                         Good God... Good God...

               All eyes on ADAM. He takes a while... Finally,

                                     ADAM
                         How do we get her out of here?

               A reasonable question. Boyd thinks. BEAT.

                                     BOYD
                         Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the 
                         car around to the back of the hotel, 
                         throw her off the balcony, put her 
                         in the car... Done.

                         You don't think someone will have a 
                         problem with a body being thrown off 
                         a balcony?

                                     BOYD
                         We check out the area and wait for a 
                         time when it's clear.

                                     ADAM
                         What about the blood?

                                     BOYD
                         Someone goes to Walmart, gets some 
                         buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and 
                         Span, the works.

                                     ADAM
                         Have you ever done this before?

                                     BOYD
                         The reality is, you take away the 
                         horror of this situation, take away 
                         the tragedy of the death, take away 
                         the moral and ethical implications 
                         of all the crap you have had 
                         conditioned, beaten, into your head 
                         since grade one. What are we left 
                         with? What? A 115 lb. problem. 115 
                         lbs. that must be moved from point A 
                         to point B. Now, a straight line in 
                         the shortest distance but we are 
                         denied the luxury of a visible 
                         straight line. But that line exists 
                         and I see it. I see that line. Trust 
                         me. Adam. Trust me... I can take 
                         care of this.

               KNOCK KNOCK

               The five men stop breathing. Somebody's at the door.

               KNOCK KNOCK

               Stunned silence. The guys stare at each other in horror.

                                     RALPH (O.S.)
                         Hello? Is anyone in there?

               Boyd races to the door, eyes the peephole.

               BOYD'S POV, through the peephole, outside in the hall, a 
               man. RALPH, early 30's, fairly unassuming.

                                     BOYD
                              (calls out)
                         What is it?

                                     RALPH (O.S.)
                         Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?

               Adam throws his head in his hands.

                                     BOYD
                              (through door)
                         What?

                                     RALPH (O.S.)
                         I'm with Tina. Is she there?

               Boyd indicates to the guys to be cool.

                                     BOYD
                         She's not here.

                                     RALPH (O.S.)
                         Where is she?

                                     BOYD
                         She's here. She's just... Hold on a 
                         second.

               Boyd turns as the guys freak. Crazed bits of panicked 
               conversation -- GIBBERISH.

               KNOCK KNOCK.

                                     RALPH (O.S.)
                         Could you open the door please.

               Boyd moves back to the door, slowly, opens it. Ralph steps 
               in. Takes a good look around.

               RALPH'S POV of the fairly destroyed hotel room and five 
               severely traumatized men.

                                     RALPH
                         Okay. Hi.

               SILENCE.

                                     RALPH
                         So who's the lucky guy?

               PAUSE.

                                     BOYD
                         Who?

                                     RALPH
                         The groom?

                                     FISHER
                         Me.

                                     RALPH
                         Cool...
                              (beat)
                         You all dudes from L.A.?

                                     BOYD
                         Yup.

                                     RALPH
                         Doing the bachelor party thing?

                                     BOYD
                         That's right.

                                     RALPH
                         Sin City. Devil's Playground. The 
                         Black Bitch. All day every day.
                              (beat)
                         Where's Tina?

                                     BOYD
                         She's in the bathroom... she's still 
                         working.

                                     RALPH
                         She's still working?

                                     BOYD
                         That's right.

                                     RALPH
                         Sweet deal.

               SILENCE. Ralph checks the rest of the guys. Some strange eye 
               contact. Extremely uncomfortable.

                                     RALPH
                         Is everything okay?

                                     BOYD
                         Great. Fine. Perfect.

               More SILENCE.

                                     RALPH
                              (indicating bathroom)
                         I'm gonna just tell her I'm waiting.

               He starts for the bathroom.

                                     BOYD
                         She's in there!

                                     RALPH
                         I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.

               And Ralph is on his way to the bathroom. And the guys are 
               freaking as Ralph moves through the bedroom up towards the 
               bathroom. Hand on door -- opening door -- stepping in -- and 
               Ralph sees Tina.

               RALPH, in shock, staring, back-peddles...

                                     RALPH
                         My God!

               As Ralph starts to turn --

                                     FISHER (O.S.)
                         No! NOOOO!!!

               ON BOYD -- his Boy Scout knife raised above his head -- 
               driving it into Ralph's neck!

               MAJOR ARTERIAL SPRAY as Ralph's jugular is severed. Ralph 
               struggles. Boyd wrestles him back toward the bathroom.

                                     BOYD
                         Help me! Don't let him bleed on the 
                         carpet!

               And MOORE is there. Helping Boyd wrestle the SCREAMING 
               thrashing Ralph into the bathroom. Ralph fights like a gilled 
               Marlin. They shove him into the bathroom. Boyd slams the 
               door shut. Holds it tight as Ralph tries to force it back 
               open.

                                     BOYD
                         He'll bleed out! He'll bleed dry. 
                         Help me hold the door.

               And help they do. Michael, Moore and Adam all hold the door 
               shut as Ralph continues to fight for his life. Slowly the 
               force of his POUNDING eases. We hear Ralph slowing down... 
               The thrashing slows... softer... The MOANS quiet... softer... 
               Just a slight GURGLE... Ralph is going... going... Ralph is 
               gone.

               AT THE DOOR

               Eight hands slowly peel off the bathroom door. Devastating 
               SILENCE as the guys attempt to process this, the latest of 
               developments... with Fisher staring, blotto.

               INT. THE BATHROOM

               The door slowly opens. Boyd first -- then the rest of the 
               guy's heads slowly appear in the doorway.

                                     MOORE
                         Oh God.

               And Moore is out the door, racing for a garbage can to relieve 
               himself.

               THE GUYS' POV

               An absolute blood bath. The walls are covered with Ralph's 
               arterial spray. Tina lies, still dead on her side. Ralph has 
               somehow "assumed the position" dead, head in the bathtub. A 
               bizarre and gruesome sight. Boyd surveys the carnage, takes 
               charge.

                                     BOYD
                              (with military 
                              precision)
                         All right people. New plan. Not even 
                         a new plan so much as a modification 
                         of the old plan.

                                     FISHER
                              (beyond shock)
                         I'm calling the police.

                                     BOYD
                         So help me God you touch that phone 
                         and I bury you with them.
                              (beat)
                         Surrender is no longer an option. I 
                         repeat -- It is not an option. Is 
                         there anyone who does not understand 
                         that?

               Fisher's response is to join Moore, as he searches for a 
               garbage can to puke in. Michael just stares.

                                     BOYD
                         A little gut check time fellas. A 
                         time for some serious self-
                         exploration. How do I function? For 
                         real? No more bullshit. Can I keep 
                         my cool when they bounce my bananas? 
                         When they won't play my fucking song? 
                         etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get 
                         me?

                                     MICHAEL
                         Not really. no.

                                     BOYD
                         Not a problem. Understand not my 
                         words, but follow my orders. Follow 
                         my orders

               INT. WALMART - NIGHT

               The boys move down the isles of the massive 24 hour everything 
               store, Boyd pushes a cart, grabbing; cleaning supplies, tarp, 
               tape, giant pruning shears, etc...

                                     BOYD (V.O.)
                         We will organize, we will mobilize, 
                         we will maximize and prioritize.

               Moore grabs a plastic garbage can off a shelf and pukes in 
               it for all he's worth.

               INT. HARD ROCK CASINO

               The boys attempt to look natural as they stroll through the 
               casino with their supplies. Late night gamblers pay them 
               little notice.

               INT. HOTEL SUITE

               Boyd turns up the MUSIC.

                                     BOYD
                         Let's do it people.

               MUSIC OVER SERIES OF SHOTS:

               Moore and Fisher scrub blood from the carpet. Fisher keeps 
               forgetting to breath.

               Michael and Boyd put Tina and Ralph in the bath tub.

               Adam sits in shock on the floor.

               Fisher and Moore try to fix a broken chair.

               Boyd starts to dismember Ralph with the pruning shears, like 
               cutting the joints of a roasted chicken.

               Adam stares at the wall.

               Michael wraps one of Ralph's feet in plastic, puts it in a 
               suitcase.

               Boyd saws. Michael wraps. Fisher and Moore clean.

               Adam slowly straightens up a lamp, begins to help.

               UNTIL -- the last of the body parts, Tina's head, is wrapped 
               in plastic, packed in a suitcase.

               The bathroom has been remarkably cleaned up. Just a bit of 
               blood left in the tub. Boyd looks pleased.

                                     BOYD
                         All right. Looking good people.

               EXT. RED ROCK CANYON ROAD

               The minivan bumps along a deserted road at a snail's pace.

               INT. MINIVAN

               Adam drives, cringing with every bump and bang. Everyone is 
               tense. Boyd eyes the clock. It's 4 a.m.

                                     BOYD
                         Sun rises at 5:52.

                                     ADAM
                         I'm not wrecking the transmission!

               EXT. DESERT

               SERIES OF SHOTS:

               The guys off-loading the suitcases.

               Fisher and Boyd digging holes.

               They start putting the suitcases in the holes.

                                     ADAM
                         Wait. Wait a minute.

                                     BOYD
                         What?

                                     ADAM
                         We can't do this.

                                     BOYD
                         We've already done this.

                                     ADAM
                         No, I mean the suitcases. We can't 
                         bury them in suitcases.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Why?

                                     ADAM
                         It's sacrilegious.

                                     BOYD
                         How do you figure?

                                     ADAM
                         According to Jewish law, the blood 
                         and limbs are considered to be part 
                         of the human being. They must be 
                         buried together or their souls won't 
                         rest in peace.

                                     BOYD
                         So that's what we're doing.

                                     ADAM
                         No we're not. The bodies are all 
                         mixed up. We can't do this to them.

                                     BOYD
                         She's Asian. They don't have Jews in 
                         Asia.

                                     ADAM
                         That is absolutely not true.

                                     BOYD
                              (beat)
                         Well what the fuck are we supposed 
                         to do?

                                     ADAM
                              (as if reasonable)
                         Open the suitcases, unpack the body 
                         parts and reunite the limbs.

                                     FISHER
                         No way.

                                     ADAM
                         It has to be done.

                                     BOYD
                         We have to get going.

                                     ADAM
                         I am not flexible on this.

               PAUSE.

                                     BOYD
                         Alright. Let's do it.

               The guys start breaking down the body parts, ripping open 
               cases...

                                     BOYD
                         I got her arm.

                                     MOORE
                         Here's his head.

               As the guys put limbs with bodies...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Dirt being thrown on top of the reunited bodies until they 
               are all completely buried.

               EXT. GRAVE SITE

               As the last of the dirt is packed down by Boyd. The guys 
               stare down at the grave site.

                                     BOYD
                         Now I am the last to say that we 
                         have done here is a good thing. It's 
                         not. It's not a good thing. But it 
                         was, given the circumstances, the 
                         smart play. We did what had to be 
                         done. And... well... I'm proud of 
                         us. I'm proud of each and every one 
                         of us. We performed. Under the most 
                         complex and nerve shattering of 
                         situations, we stood fast and we 
                         delivered. I feel proud.

               SILENCE.

                                     ADAM
                         We are all going straight to hell. 
                         Either hell or prison, whichever 
                         comes first.

                                     BOYD
                         Wrong. That is flat out wrong. hell 
                         is for cowards, for hypocrites who 
                         fear to live by the strength of their 
                         own convictions. This is war. Given 
                         the circumstances and given the fact 
                         that we are alive and they are not, 
                         we have chosen life over death. Two 
                         wrongs don't make a right. So our 
                         conviction and execution would only 
                         mean more death here, not less.

                                     MOORE
                         Boyd... I don't know man... It just 
                         seems to me that ever since you took 
                         Tony Robbins self-help thing... you're 
                         all fucked-up in the head.

                                     FISHER
                         I got to agree with that.

                                     BOYD
                         That is a load of shit. Personal 
                         power has nothing to do with any of 
                         this. Tony Robbins has helped me to 
                         unlock energy and see my options 
                         more clearly, yes, but to give him 
                         credit for this, for all of this... 
                         Well that's just more than the man 
                         deserves.

                                     FISHER
                         I think we should say some words 
                         over the grave.

                                     BOYD
                         What kind of words?

                                     FISHER
                         I'm talking about prayer.

                                     BOYD
                         Go ahead.

               Fisher steps to the grave, looks down.

                                     FISHER
                         Dear God... I don't know how to pray.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Just go ahead and say what's on your 
                         mind.

                                     BOYD
                         Speak from the heart my brother.

               Adam turns in disgust.

                                     ADAM
                         This is pathetic.

                                     MICHAEL
                         You're pathetic.

                                     ADAM
                              (turning on Michael)
                         What did you say?

                                     MICHAEL
                              (pointing)
                         You're not a team player.

                                     ADAM
                         Don't point at me.

                                     MICHAEL
                         You never were a team player. That's 
                         why you never had any friends.

                                     ADAM
                         I have plenty of friends.

                                     MICHAEL
                         The hell you do.

                                     ADAM
                         The hell I don't.

                                     MICHAEL
                         You have acquaintances -- business 
                         friends and superficial golf buddies. 
                         You have always been a fringe player. 
                         You have some serious male on male 
                         intimacy problems.

                                     ADAM
                         What are you fucking talking about?

               Michael looks at Boyd.

                                     FISHER
                         Michael, now is probably not the 
                         best time for this.

                                     BOYD
                         No, this is the perfect time. This 
                         is real time. Adam. Your brother and 
                         I, as well as several others present, 
                         have always suspected that you...
                              (points to Adam)
                         ...are a fully repressed, living in 
                         major denial, locked down, fly-boy 
                         butt-fucker.

               DEAD SILENCE. Adam stares stupefied at Boyd, then Michael. 
               Finally, Fisher says his prayer.

                                     FISHER
                         Dear God, please forgive us for what 
                         we have done here tonight. We have 
                         lost our way. Speaking for myself, 
                         let me say...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. MINIVAN - DRIVING

               Fisher's prayer over the guys driving home. Each lost in his 
               own thoughts.

                                     FISHER (V.O.)
                         ...I am deeply in love with the woman 
                         I am about to marry and I look very 
                         much forward to raising a family and 
                         being a positive member of society. 
                         We promise, if you forgive us, we 
                         will never forget this tragedy and 
                         will try with all our powers to use 
                         it as a daily reminder that we are 
                         here on earth to do good not evil. 
                         Let us go from this day forward with 
                         new purpose and spirit. You have 
                         given us a second chance and let us 
                         take that second chance and use it 
                         as fuel to feed our fires of 
                         productivity so that the spirits of 
                         the two we now bury live on forever 
                         in the good deeds and positive 
                         achievements we from this moment on 
                         shall make our life's work...

               Continue as the minivan disappears down the freeway, heading 
               back to Los Angeles. A freeway sign reads, "Los Angeles, 358 
               miles."

                                     FISHER (V.O.)
                         Thank you lord, and again, we ask 
                         for your forgiveness and guidance... 
                         Amen.

               EXT. CAR WASH - DAY

               Adam watches his mini-van move through the wash and rinse 
               cycle, staring, paranoid at the Mexican Towel Boy cleaning 
               the interior.

               MICHAEL tries to open a child proof bottle of Excedrin.

               BOYD plays "Mrs. Pac-man" in the corner.

               MEN'S ROOM

               Moore dry heaves for all he's worth.

               PAY PHONE

               Fisher finishes dialing, waits... Finally...

                                     LIZ (V.O.)
                         Hello.

                                     FISHER
                         Hey. It's me.

                                     LIZ (V.O.)
                         Where are you?

                                     FISHER
                         We're on our way home. I just... 
                         we're running a little late.

                                     LIZ (V.O.)
                         How late?

                                     FISHER
                         No. Just like an hour or so.

                                     LIZ (V.O.)
                         What about the chairs?

                                     FISHER
                         Okay.

                                     LIZ (V.O.)
                         What okay?

                                     FISHER
                         What!

                                     LIZ (V.O.)
                         The chairs.

                                     FISHER
                         I left a message. I think it's going 
                         to be okay.

                                     LIZ (V.O.)
                         You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?

                                     FISHER
                         No. No. I'll see you in about four 
                         hours.

               As he hangs up the phone...

                                     LIZ (V.O.)
                              (distant; unheard)
                         Do you love me?

               CLICK. Fisher, in a daze, turns and walks into right into 
               Adam who has been standing there listening. Adam doesn't 
               look so good.

                                     ADAM
                         I want you to hear me out.

                                     FISHER
                         What.

                                     ADAM
                         You and I have done nothing. You 
                         especially. We are innocent.

                                     FISHER
                         I don't think so.

                                     ADAM
                         We are. We go to the police. We tell 
                         them the truth. Now. Before they 
                         find out. Now. We save ourselves.

               The HISPANIC CAR WASH WORKER beeps the horn, Adam jumps. The 
               van is ready.

                                     BOYD
                         Let's go!

               Adam stares daggers into Fisher.

                                     ADAM
                         We save ourselves. It's our only 
                         chance.

               Adam heads back to the car, leaving Fisher alone.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

               EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - DAY

               The shiny clean minivan cruises to a stop in front of the 
               house. Adam Jr., "Little Adam," and Timmy play in the fenced 
               yard along with a couple of other kids.

               INT. MINIVAN

               Adam stops the car. The guys sit in silence as the kids 
               assault the truck, climbing all over it. Little Adam waves 
               his crutches wildly.

                                     ADAM JR.
                              (screaming)
                         Daddy's home! Daddy's home!

               Boyd addresses the fellas.

                                     BOYD
                         The past is the past. Today is the 
                         beginning of the rest of our lives.

                                     MOORE
                         Today is the best day of the rest of 
                         our lives.

                                     FISHER
                              (disgusted)
                         The first day.

                                     MOORE
                         What?

               As Lois, with camera, and Liz, come out the front door.

                                     FISHER
                              (disgusted & depressed)
                         It goes; "Today is the first day of 
                         the rest of our lives."

                                     BOYD
                         However it goes, the point is, nobody 
                         says anything to anyone ever. 
                         Right?... Right?

                                     MICHAEL
                         Right.

                                     MOORE
                         That's right.

               As the little kids put their lips up to the windows, making 
               funny faces,

                                     BOYD
                         You're goddamn right. Adam?

               Adam is silent, watching the beautiful chaos that is his 
               family.

                                     ADAM
                              (reluctant)
                         Right.

               EXT. SUBURBAN

               As the guys get out and are mauled by the hyper kids and 
               Lois and Liz.

                                     LOIS
                              (with camera)
                         Group shot. Here we go boys! Yes 
                         sir, compare and contrast time!

               She starts herding the boys into a group pose.

                                     LOIS
                         Feeling a little HUNGOVER are we? Do 
                         you kids take note?
                              (taking pictures)
                         See how pathetic Daddy and his jackass 
                         friends look?!

               Fisher makes eye contact with Liz.

                                     LIZ
                         What's the word on the chairs?

                                     FISHER
                         I'm working on it.

                                     LIZ
                         Then you'd better work on it in the 
                         car. We gotta go see the Judge.

               INT. JUDGE'S OFFICE

               ON JUDGE LAUREL TOWER.

                                     JUDGE TOWER
                         We don't say "love, honor and obey" 
                         anymore. And we don't say "till death 
                         do us part." Today we say, "respect, 
                         honor and cherish, as long as you 
                         both do love." How does that sound?

                                     LIZ
                         I kind of like "till death do us 
                         part." I mean, this is forever. In 
                         sickness and in health, through good 
                         times and bad. Honey, what do you 
                         think?

               Liz looks at Fisher who is a nuclear wreck, barely coherent.

                                     FISHER
                         Yea... It's great... seems like... I 
                         don't know you've got all the 
                         important stuff in there.

                                     JUDGE TOWER
                         All right then. It's refreshing to 
                         see two young people not afraid of 
                         real commitment. Will you have friends 
                         or family saying words -- singing or 
                         anything?

                                     FISHER
                              (beat)
                         Are we supposed to?

                                     JUDGE TOWER
                         It's not a question of supposed to, 
                         it's an entirely personal decision... 
                         Some do some don't.

                                     LIZ
                         We don't think so. I mean, we just 
                         want the singing when I come out.

                                     JUDGE TOWER
                         Okay great. What will that be?

                                     LIZ
                         We're just going to have the leader 
                         of the band sing alone with his 
                         guitar. Acoustic.

                                     JUDGE TOWER
                         What song?

                                     LIZ
                         "You Send Me."

                                     JUDGE TOWER
                         Oh I know that. How does it go...

                                     LIZ
                         You know,
                              (talks it)
                         Darling you... you send me... Darling 
                         you... You mend me.
                              (to Fisher)
                         Honey, sing it for Judge Tower.

               In lieu of an anxiety attack, Fisher...

                                     FISHER
                              (sings)
                         "Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send 
                         me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, 
                         mend me.

                                     LIZ
                         "At first I thought it was 
                         infatuation... But oh it's lasted so 
                         long..."

                                     FISHER & LIZ
                         "Now I find myself wanting to marry 
                         you, marry you and take you home..."

               Judge Tower joins in and the three squeak out the chorus and 
               it's pretty pathetic.

               MUSIC OVER:

               INT. TUXEDO RENTAL STORE

               The guys are being fitted for their wedding tuxes.

               Lois takes pictures of the five groomsmen.

               Liz closely watches as the TAILOR makes adjustments to 
               Fisher's tux.

               Adam looks sick.

               EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - SUNSET

               Fisher and his dad walk along the pier eating hot dogs. A 
               father and son moment.

                                     MR. FISHER
                         I wanted to just take this final 
                         opportunity to visit with you. You 
                         know, just to be with you, father 
                         and son, before you run off and do 
                         your own husband, daddy thing.
                              (starts to choke-up)
                         I'm just so goddamn proud of you... 
                         God knows I didn't always play it 
                         right with you...

                                     FISHER
                         You did all right dad.

                                     MR. FISHER
                         I could have done it better. I'm a 
                         fucking ball-buster I am.

                                     FISHER
                         You never walked away dad. You could 
                         have walked away.

                                     MR. FISHER
                         I'm just so scared of that song. 
                         That fucking, "My son just arrived 
                         the other day... he says thanks for 
                         the ball, come on let's play. I got 
                         lots of bills come again next day. 
                         He's grown up just like me... My boy 
                         is just like me." Gordon fucking 
                         Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, 
                         that song just fucking kills me.

                         Just kills me...

                                     FISHER
                         I love you dad.

                                     MR. FISHER
                         I love you so much it hurts. Me and 
                         your mother marvel at what you have 
                         become. You're going to have a 
                         wonderful journey with this girl. I 
                         feel it deep inside. A wonderful, 
                         magical journey.
                              (cries again)
                         And I'm, like I said, just so proud 
                         of how you turned out. (hugs Fisher) 
                         You go out and knock 'em dead Keith. 
                         Knock 'em dead!

               Off Fisher we...

                         Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. 
                         They're on to us.

                                     MICHAEL
                         They're not on to us. I'm gonna call 
                         Boyd.

               Michael picks up the phone.

               EXT. SOMEBODY'S YARD

               TIGHT ON BOYD talking into cell phone.

                                     BOYD
                         Oh that's just nothing. That's just 
                         a missing persons thing, that's all.

                                     MICHAEL
                         You said nobody would miss her.

                                     BOYD
                         No. I said nobody knew she was coming 
                         to the hotel.

                                     ADAM
                              (grabs phone)
                         Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming 
                         down!

                                     BOYD
                         What does that mean?

                                     ADAM
                         You got us into this mess.

                                     BOYD
                         Oh I did? I think it was your little 
                         rat fuck brother who decided to play 
                         Hamburger Helper with the hooker's 
                         head.

                                     ADAM
                              (freaks)
                         Would you, shush?! These phones aren't 
                         secure!

                                     BOYD
                         Lighten up Adam. Show some character.

                                     ADAM
                         Don't talk to me about character.

                                     BOYD
                         Watch the tone fella.

               Fisher realizes he's not breathing.

                                     ADAM
                         Fuck you Boyd!

                                     BOYD
                         Any time fat boy!

               Boyd hangs up the phone, looks at his picture on the realty 
               sign he just pounded into someone's yard. Behind the bizarre 
               sincere smile we now see the eyes of a maniac. Boyd picks up 
               the sledge hammer and swings wildly, destroying his sign, 
               splintering it into kindling.

               INT. BAKERY

               Fisher and Liz taste different samples of cake and compare 
               different cake designs with a BAKER.

               INT. FLORIST

               Surrounded by hundreds of different floral arrangements, Liz 
               shows a zombied Fisher the flowers she's picked for the 
               wedding.

               INT. LIZ AND FISHER'S NEW HOME

               A beautiful country style beach house in Santa Monica. Liz, 
               Fisher and the realtor, MAGGIE, walk into the charming 
               kitchen. Fisher seems stresses by the price tag.

                                     LIZ
                         I love it. I just love, love, love, 
                         love it.

                                     MAGGIE
                         Are you guys gonna fill this place 
                         with kids? You sure got room for 
                         them.

                                     LIZ
                         We're in no hurry. I think we'll 
                         take some time to enjoy each other, 
                         enjoy our freedom before we surrender 
                         ourselves to kids.

                                     MAGGIE
                         Take your time. I wish I had.

                                     LIZ
                              (hugs Fisher)
                         We will.

                                     MAGGIE
                         So where to on the honeymoon?

                                     FISHER
                         This is our honeymoon.

                                     LIZ
                         After the wedding, which we're paying 
                         for ourselves, and this house...

                                     MAGGIE
                         Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big 
                         picture, take your time. I wish I 
                         had.

                                     LIZ
                         That's our plan.

                                     MAGGIE
                         Well, I just need your signature on 
                         these contracts and a deposit check 
                         so I can get the ball rolling.

               Liz looks at Fisher. She really wants the house. He takes 
               out his checkbook. Liz throws her arms around Fisher, kisses 
               him.

                                     FISHER
                         How much?

                                     MAGGIE
                         Five percent should be fine for now, 
                         which is, let's see, twenty thousand 
                         dollars. Of course I'll be splitting 
                         my commission with your friend.
                              (beat)
                         He is a very sweet man.

               Liz stares at Fisher. His hand shakes as he writes the check.

               EXT. GAS STATION MINI-MART

               Adam, Lois and the kids pull into the mini-mart, up to the 
               gas pump.

               INT. ADAM'S MINI-VAN

               Adam, ghost white, fumbles for a credit card as the kids go 
               nuts in the back seat.

                                     KIDS
                              (singing)
                         "Do your balls hang low, do they 
                         wobble to and fro, can you tie 'em 
                         in a knot, can you tie 'em in a bow?"

                                     ADAM
                              (snapping)
                         Knock it off!

                                     LOIS
                         Don't snap at them!

                                     ADAM
                         They're driving me nuts!

                                     LOIS
                         They're singing.

               A black sedan, looking like an unmarked police car, pulls up 
               nose-to-nose with them at the pump. TWO MEN in dark suits in 
               the front look like cops. Adam can't help but notice.

                                     ADAM
                              (getting out)
                         It's a disgusting song.

               EXT. CAR

               Adam slides his card through at the pump and starts filling 
               his tank as one of the "suits" gets out of the black sedan 
               and does the same.

               Adam and the "suit" make eye-contact.

                                     SUIT
                         How ya doing?

                                     ADAM
                              (nervous mumble)
                         What?

                                     SUIT
                         What's that?

                                     ADAM
                         What did you say?

                                     SUIT
                         I said how's it going?

                                     ADAM
                         I didn't hear you.

                                     SUIT
                         Well that's what I said.

               Adam nods, eyeing his gas pump, willing it to pump faster. 
               His heart starts to pound, he looks away, sees...

               An LAPD police car pull into the station, stops in front of 
               the mini-mart. TWO COPS inside.

               ON adam, eye-balling the cop car. He slowly turns to steal a 
               glance at the "suit."

                                     SUIT
                         How do you like that mini-van?

               Adam's tank is almost filled. He wants nothing more than to 
               get out of there...

               Lois rolls down the window.

                                     LOIS
                         Honey, go in there and get some 
                         Starbursts.

                                     ADAM
                         What?

                                     LOIS
                         They're screaming for Starbursts.

                                     ADAM
                         Later.

                                     LOIS
                         They're screaming like monsters and 
                         it's giving me a headache. Go get 
                         some fucking Starbursts.

               Adam looks from the suit to the cop car...

                                     ADAM
                         Fine.

               TRACK with Adam as he walks from the pumping across the 
               parking lot, past the cop car, his HEART POUNDING...

               INT. MINI-MART

               Adam quickly searches the candy section for Starburst. He 
               looks out the window...

               ADAM'S POV

               The "suit" has finished with the gas but he's not leaving... 
               He's taking a close look at Adam's van. He seems to be 
               checking the license plate...

                                     ADAM
                         Oh my God.

               Adam is blocking the aisle. He doesn't notice a YOUNG  
               UNIFORMED COP trying to get past.

                                     COP (O.S.)
                         Excuse me.

               Adam turns, panics, stumbles back, into the candy display 
               and topples to the ground. ADAM lies flat on his back in a 
               monster mess of candy.

                                     COP
                         You okay?

               Adam scrambles to his feet, trying frantically to fix the 
               major mess -- only making it worse. The IRANIAN STORE CLERK 
               approaches, pissed.

                                     CLERK
                         Just leave it!

                                     ADAM
                              (determined)
                         It's okay.

                                     CLERK
                         Leave it!

               Startled by his tone, Adam staggers back, into a Gatorade 
               display, slips and topples to the ground.

                                     CLERK
                         GET OUT!

                                     ADAM
                              (on his back)
                         I'm sorry.

               They young cop gives Adam a hand up. Adam stare at the cop.

                                     ADAM
                              (tears in his eyes)
                         I'm sorry.

                                     CLERK
                         GET OUT!

               Adam scurries out of the Mini-Mart, the Cop watches in 
               confusion.

               EXT. MINI-MART

               As Adam races back to his car, the "Suit" moves in on him.

                                     SUIT
                         The wife's begging me for one. How's 
                         the mileage.

               Adam jumps in the van, quickly starts it up.

                                     LOIS
                         Where's the candy?

                                     ADAM
                         There is no candy!

                                     LOIS
                         What do you mean? It's it's a goddamn 
                         Mini-Mart?!

                                     KIDS
                         Dad?!

               Adam, in a cold sweat, hauls out of the Gas Station, pulls 
               into traffic, nearly gets hit, slams on the brakes, Lois 
               rockets FACE-FORWARD into the dashboard.

               FISHER & LIZ'S REHEARSAL DINNER - COCKTAIL RECEPTION

               SERIES OF SHOTS:

               Fisher and Liz greet their guests.

               Moore smokes alone at the bar.

               Boyd and Michael charm a group of OLD LADIES.

               Adam arrives with his family, Adam Jr., Timmy and...

               Lois sporting a nose cast and two very black eyes.

               Boyd and Adam check each other out; hostile and suspicious.

               Adam takes Fisher aside.

                                     ADAM
                         Have you thought about what I said?

                                     FISHER
                         Jesus Adam, can we not get into this 
                         now please?

                                     ADAM
                         I got a migraine like a little monkey 
                         kicking in the side of my skull, 
                         Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge 
                         hammer trying to crack...

                                     FISHER
                              (cuts him off)
                         I got you.

                                     ADAM
                              (dazed)
                         Where's the bathroom?

               INT. REHEARSAL DINNER - NIGHT

               A large dining room in a Westside restaurant has been taken 
               over by the wedding party. Seventy-five guests, dressed up, 
               are into the desserts. The toasts are about halfway over.

               MR. FISHER stands in the middle of the room with the large 
               blown-up pictures of Keith at different stages of his life.

                                     MR. FISHER
                              (holding picture of 
                              Keith, age 4, on a 
                              mule)
                         And this is Keith at age four and 
                         his best friend "Bunker the Mule." 
                         Evidently, when they were in camp, 
                         Keith and Boyd got into some serious 
                         arguments over exactly who was Keith's 
                         best friend -- Boyd or the mule.

               Mr. Fisher holds up a photo of a young Fisher and young Boyd, 
               both scrappy and bloodied from a fist fight.

               Boyd sits with Moore at a table.

                                     BOYD
                         Fisher had a less than normal 
                         relationship with that Donkey.

                                     FISHER
                              (seated next to Liz)
                         You always were a jealous man.

               Mr. Fisher holds up a picture of Keith, Boyd, Moore and 
               Michael all in a Peewee Football uniforms.

                                     MR. FISHER
                         After camp came football, and for 
                         those of you not following the sports 
                         pages back in 1977, you might not 
                         remember the Peewee Powerhouse 
                         Oklahoma, who, under the brilliant 
                         leadership of your's truly, rolled 
                         to an auspicious league record of 0-
                         12 scoring exactly zero touchdowns.

               TIGHT ON Adam, looking extremely uncomfortable, surrounded 
               by his family.

                                     MICHAEL
                         The problem was coaching. Poor 
                         leadership.

               As the room LAUGHS, Adam becomes visibly upset. Not keeping 
               it together.

                                     BOYD
                         The problem was our quarterback had 
                         trouble remembering his right from 
                         left...

                                     FISHER
                         No, the problem, as I recall, was 
                         the lack of blocking...

               As the guys debate, in front of the room, who's fault 
               Oklahoma's 0-12 season really was.

               TIGHT ON Adam. He's had enough, excuses himself from the 
               table.

               TIGHT ON Fisher, seeing Adam, he quietly excuses himself.

               EXT. BEACH RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               Adam stands by his car trying to compose himself. Fisher 
               approaches.

                                     FISHER
                         You all right?

                                     ADAM
                         I can't fucking breathe. I'm sorry.

               Boyd, followed by Michael exits the restaurant.

                                     BOYD
                              (approaching)
                         OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely 
                         inappropriate behavior here.

                                     FISHER
                         Shut up Boyd.

                                     BOYD
                         Negative. This is not what we have 
                         worked out in terms of presented 
                         behavior.

                                     FISHER
                         He's having a problem here.

                                     MICHAEL
                         What's the problem Adam?

               Moore joins the group.

                                     MOORE
                         What's the problem?

               All eyes on Adam, who's eyes are starting to tear up.

                                     BOYD
                         What is your problem?

                                     ADAM
                         I can't do this.

               PAUSE.

                                     MOORE
                         Can't do what?

                                     ADAM
                         We're gonna get caught. I know we're 
                         gonna get caught. They were eyeballing 
                         my car.

                                     BOYD
                         What?

                                     ADAM
                         At the seven-eleven.

                                     BOYD
                         Who? What are you talking about?

                                     ADAM
                         They're on me. They're smoking me 
                         out!

                                     BOYD
                              (shouts)
                         Nobody's smoking anybody out.

                                     FISHER
                         Shut up.

                                     MOORE
                         Quiet.

               Liz is at the door of the restaurant.

                                     LIZ
                         Keith? Is everything okay, honey?

               Fisher bolts over to Liz.

                                     FISHER
                         Yeah baby. Everything's great.

                                     LIZ
                         Well, can you come back inside?

                                     FISHER
                              (not moving)
                         Yeah. Sure.

                                     LIZ
                         Now?

                                     FISHER
                         Yeah. Look honey, I'll be right in. 
                         I just... we're just taking care of 
                         some Groomsmen last minute business.

               Mr. Fisher approaches.

                                     MR. FISHER
                         Everything okay?

                                     FISHER
                         Yeah, Dad. It's great.

                                     MR. FISHER
                         Well, I'm in the middle of my goddamn 
                         toast here.

                                     FISHER
                         OK, OK. You guys just go back in. 
                         Dad, keep going with the toast, we'll 
                         be right in. Go on.

               Fisher ushers his father and Liz back inside, then turns, to 
               quickly head back to the parking lot where things are 
               escalating.

               PARKING LOT

                                     BOYD
                              (on Adam)
                         You got some mighty fucking fine bad 
                         timing Adam. We got a rehearsal 
                         situation here.

                                     ADAM
                         I don't give a damn.

                                     MICHAEL
                         About anybody but yourself. You never 
                         have.

                                     ADAM
                         And you're a little fucking reject.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Eat my ass!

               MICHAEL KICKS ADAM'S MINIVAN

                                     ADAM
                         Hey!

               Michael kicks it again, harder. Adam shoves him.

                                     ADAM
                         If you ever touch my minivan again, 
                         I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.

                                     MICHAEL
                         You're a loser.

                                     ADAM
                         You're the loser! A big black hole 
                         sucking up everything you touch! YOU 
                         MURDERED THAT GIRL! MURDERER! 
                         MURDERER!

                                     MICHAEL
                         You're the loser! You think your 
                         shit's so fucking righteous! FUCK 
                         YOU! You were there with us, boy! 
                         Right there! SIDE BY FUCKING SIDE!!!

                                     FISHER
                         Shut up!

                                     BOYD
                         Shut your fucking mouths!!!

               Boyd and Fisher separate the brothers.

                                     ADAM
                              (freaking)
                         I didn't do anything! I'll turn your 
                         pathetic ass in!

                                     BOYD
                         Adam! Calm down.

                                     ADAM
                         I won't calm down. I can't do this. 
                         We can't do this. It won't work. It 
                         will not work.

                                     BOYD
                         It has worked.

                                     ADAM
                         I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber 
                         optics, search parties, they got 
                         infrared scanners, FBI scientists. 
                         They figure this shit out. They always 
                         figure it out.

                                     BOYD
                         They won't figure it out.

                                     ADAM
                         I got children. I've got a life.

                                     MICHAEL
                         You got a retarded kid and a fat pig 
                         wife.

                                     ADAM
                         You fucking bastard!

               Adam attacks Michael, slashing, biting, mauling, the brother's 
               go down hard, slugging it out on the ground.

               EXT RESTAURANT

               Liz is back at the restaurant door.

                                     LIZ
                         Keith?!

               Fisher bolts over to Liz.

                                     FISHER
                         Everything's OK. Just some more 
                         preparations.

                                     LIZ
                         Are they fighting?

                                     FISHER
                         No baby. We'll all be right in.

               Fisher pushes her inside and charges back to the...

               PARKING LOT

               Fisher helps break the fight. Adam and Michael try to contain 
               their rage.

                                     BOYD
                         This is going to stop right now. 
                         Right now!

                                     MICHAEL
                              (seething)
                         You will not screw this up.

                                     ADAM
                         Don't you threaten me you little rat 
                         fuck.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Don't you fucking threaten me -- 
                         I'll fucking kill you.

                                     ADAM
                         Go home!

                                     MICHAEL
                         You go home!

               Boyd pulls Michael to his car.

                                     BOYD
                         Why don't you just cool out. Go home 
                         and go to sleep.

               Boyd opens Michael's car door, puts him in.

                                     BOYD
                         Just go home, chill the fuck out. 
                         Okay?

               Michael starts his car. Boyd shuts the car door.

                                     BOYD
                         Just go home.

               MICHAEL, eyeballs Adam. Adam eyeballs him right back. Michael 
               hits the gas and screeches away.

                                     BOYD
                         All right. Let's all go back in. 
                         Adam? You're cool right?

                                     ADAM
                         No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at 
                         all.

               Reluctantly, they start back in.

               A hundred or so feet away, Michael's car comes to an abrupt 
               stop. They all turn. Michael turns his car around, idles for 
               a moment.

               INT. MICHAEL'S CAR

               Michael in a trance, staring at the guys watching him.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Mr. Fucking Minivan...

               He hits the gas.

               EXT PARKING LOT

               Wheels spin, rubber burns. The guys watch as Michael speeds 
               full throttle, like a battering ram, right at Adam's beloved 
               minivan.

                                     ADAM
                         NOOOO!!!!

               Adam jumps between the minivan and Michael's car.

               INT. MICHAEL'S CAR

               Michael's expression turns to horror. He slams on the brakes, 
               but it's too late.

               EXT. PARKING LOT

               Michael's car crushes Adam like a sandwich meat between his 
               car and the minivan. Metal, flesh, severed limbs, Adam 
               explodes like a gnat.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE HORRIFIED EXPRESSIONS OF BOYD, MOORE AND FISHER

               INT. UCLA EMERGENCY - WAITING ROOM

               Chaos. The room is filled with people from the Rehearsal 
               Dinner.

               Black-eyed, nose broken, LOIS sobs, surrounded by her kids 
               and Liz.

               Boyd and Fisher talk to the POLICE.

                                     BOYD
                         It was just a crazy freak accident. 
                         He thought the car was in reverse... 
                         He didn't realize.

               The COP takes notes.

               MICHAEL sits in a corner by himself. Ghost white. Trembling.

                                     COP
                         Was there some sort of an argument?

                                     FISHER
                         No. Nothing like that.

                                     COP
                         We heard there was some arguing going 
                         on. Some loud talk.

                                     BOYD
                         No. No. We were just all outside 
                         just talking.

                                     COP
                         What were you talking about?

                                     BOYD
                         The wedding. We were talking bout 
                         how it was going to be one of the 
                         last times for us to all be together 
                         with Fisher not being married...

                                     COP
                         A lot of people seem to think there 
                         was some hostility out there.

                                     BOYD
                              (getting righteous)
                         Well I can't really comment on what 
                         "a lot of people" thought. I can 
                         only tell you that we had a horrible 
                         accident here and were all feeling 
                         extremely traumatized and your 
                         questions are a bit poorly timed. 
                         We're in full on grieving mode right 
                         now thank you very much Officer... 
                         Randone.

                                     FISHER
                         Easy Boyd.

                                     BOYD
                         No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in 
                         there in pieces. How about a little 
                         sensitivity?

               Boyd storms off, goes and sits with Michael. Fisher stays 
               with the cop.

                                     COP
                         That's all I wanted to know.

               A DOCTOR appears in the doorway.

                                     DOCTOR
                         His situation is critical. He's asking 
                         to speak to his wife.

               SHOTS of the guys eyeing each other nervously as Lois slowly 
               gets up and follows the Doctor into a treatment room.

               The guys move to the door, where they can see Lois, leaning 
               over the hospital bed, talking to Adam.

               POV GUYS

               Adam hooked up to dozens of wires, etc...

               Lois leans over to kiss him. Adam appears to be whispering 
               something to her.

               ON THE GUYS

               Watching Adam speak to Lois... Nervous.

               POV GUYS

               Lois has her ear to Adam's mouth. He is clearly speaking to 
               her. Lois is sobbing when... ALARMS GO OFF IN ADAM'S ROOM.

               A MEDICAL TEAM rushes into the room. Adam is a v-tach -- 
               Heart's not beating. The team injects medicine, defribulates. 
               Lois watches in horror as her husband dies in front of her... 
               Finally a DOCTOR calls time of death.

               Lois collapses on the floor.

               WAITING ROOM

               The guys have witnessed Adam's death. Michael turns in horror. 
               Boyd, Fisher and Moore stare. Liz rushes to Fisher, throws 
               her arms around him, overcome with grief.

               INT. DENNY'S - LATE NIGHT

               Fisher, Boyd, Moore and Michael eat eggs.

                                     BOYD
                         The need to know is clear. What did 
                         Adam tell Lois? That's the name of 
                         the game. What did Adam tell Lois? 
                         What does Lois know?

                                     MICHAEL
                         Ball park sausages.

                                     BOYD
                         You want some breakfast meat, Michael. 
                         Is that what you want?

                                     MICHAEL
                              (clearly starting to 
                              crack)
                         Franco Harris has a flare for the 
                         dramatic. The former Pittsburgh 
                         Steeler running back, beat known for 
                         "The Immaculate Reception," his 
                         improbable sixty yard Ricochet 
                         Reception. I say Ricochet Reception 
                         has made a bold move on corporate 
                         America.
                              (inappropriately loud)
                         Harris has lead a group of investors 
                         in the purchase of the Park Sausage 
                         Company. By taking on the challenge 
                         of resurrecting Park's, Harris is 
                         engaged in the equivalent of a sudden 
                         death overtime.

                                     BOYD
                         Easy Michael.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (on a roll)
                         He must take an open-field run to 
                         profitability through excessive debt 
                         large competitors and dwindling market 
                         share. Before the clock runs out.

               CUSTOMERS are starting to pay notice.

                                     MOORE
                         Shut up Michael.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (screams)
                         I KILLED MY BROTHER!

               All eyes on Michael. Boyd is immediately up trying to get 
               Michael out of the booth. Casually, sweetly...

                                     BOYD
                         Okay. Time to fly.

               Fisher helps Boyd lift Michael, who is becoming more and 
               more frenzied.

                                     MICHAEL
                         I ran down my brother in cold blood. 
                         Shame on me! Shame! Shame! Shame!

               WAITRESSES, COOKS and LATE NIGHT DINNERS stare, confused as 
               the HOWLING Michael is carried to the door.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (struggling)
                         Time to pay the man. "For if we 
                         confess our sins he is faithful and 
                         just, to forgive us our sins, and to 
                         cleanse us from all unrighteousness."

               Fisher and Boyd struggle with Michael.

                                     FISHER
                              (tipping Waitress)
                         Thank you.

               She watches them haul Michael outside.

               POV WAITRESS

               Michael thrashes wildly in the parking lot.

               EXT PARKING LOT

                                     MICHAEL
                         "Kill one man and you are a murderer! 
                         Kill millions and you are a conqueror -- 
                         Kill all and you are a God!"

               Michael breaks free, starts running away. Boyd, Moore and 
               Fisher give chase. Moore dives on Michael's back. Fisher 
               helps Moore hold Michael down while Boyd gets the car.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (calming down)
                         "The memory of the just is blessed 
                         but the name of the wicked shall 
                         rot."

               Boyd is there with the car. They load Michael into the back 
               seat, climb in and disappear into the night.

               INT. CAR - DRIVING

               Boyd drives, Fisher rides shotgun, Moore's in the back trying 
               to contain Michael.

                                     BOYD
                         You will get yourself together here 
                         mister. Are you hearing me?

               Michael, now catatonic, stares out the window.

                                     FISHER
                         He's cracked up.

                                     BOYD
                         He is not cracking up.

                                     FISHER
                         Boyd... What have we done?

                                     BOYD
                         What did you ask me?

                                     FISHER
                         What?

                                     BOYD
                         What is the question you asked me?

                                     FISHER
                         I said, what have we done?

                                     BOYD
                         Yes, you did. Now that is the 
                         question! That is exactly the question 
                         we should be asking ourselves. You 
                         tell me Fisher. What have we done?

                                     FISHER
                         I don't know! I just want to get 
                         married.

                                     BOYD
                         Say it again.

                                     FISHER
                         What?

                                     BOYD
                         What you just said. Say it again.

                                     FISHER
                         I just want to get married.

                                     BOYD
                         Exactly! Exactly my point.

                                     MOORE
                         What's your fucking point?

                                     BOYD
                         I'm not talking to you?

                                     FISHER
                         What's your point?

                                     BOYD
                         You want to know what you are doing 
                         here?! You are love pumping. You are 
                         protecting all that is sacred and 
                         beautiful and in sync with poetry 
                         and sunsets and little newborn babies. 
                         You are walking the walk. This is it 
                         Fisher, the real stuff. You love 
                         this woman. Love is second to nothing. 
                         I love you. I love Moore. I love 
                         Michael. This car is full of love, 
                         and nothing -- absolutely nothing -- 
                         supersedes love, man. Nothing. We 
                         will do what it takes. Whatever it 
                         takes.

               Boyd takes Fisher's head in his hands and kisses him deeply 
               on the mouth.

                                     BOYD
                         Love does not lose.

               TIGHT ON Fisher, speechless.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN ON:

               ADAM'S FUNERAL - GRAVE SITE

               A Jewish ceremony. A hundred or so guests. A RABBI conducts 
               the service. Lois sits in shock flanked by her boys.

               Michael, Fisher, Boyd and Moore stand in positions of honor 
               up front. They're all eyeing each other.

               Michael starts emitting deep, uncontrollable, highly 
               inappropriate MOANS.

                                     BOYD
                         Easy Michael.

               Michael can't control himself as his body starts to seize 
               and tremble. Moore and Boys attempt to stabilize Michael who 
               breaks away, charges over to Lois and buries his head in her 
               lap sobbing deeply. Everyone is stunned but the Rabbi 
               Continues.

               INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Liz and Fisher.

                         Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of 
                         your fucking mind?!

                                     FISHER
                         Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking 
                         about modifying.

                                     LIZ
                         No way.

                                     FISHER
                         Can we just talk this out?

                                     LIZ
                         Talk what out? We are locked and 
                         loaded here. We are non-refundable. 
                         I've got relatives on the airport 
                         right now! I've got...

               The phone RINGS. Fisher freezes.

                                     LIZ
                         Answer it!

               Fisher picks up the phone.

                                     FISHER
                         Hello?

               INT. LOIS' HOUSE

               Lois on the phone, near hysteria.

                                     LOIS
                         Keith. It's Lois. I just found a 
                         note up in Adam's study. It's some 
                         kind of crazy confession about killing 
                         a stripper and cutting up bodies 
                         and...

               INT. CANTERS COFFEE SHOP

               TIGHT ON FISHER

                                     FISHER
                              (explaining)
                         ...burying them outside of Vegas, 
                         about Boyd being the ring leader... 
                         She wants to know what the hell is 
                         going on and I'm starting to freak 
                         out here.

               Boyd, Moore and Michael, looking particularly traumatized, 
               are seated at a booth with Fisher.

                                     MICHAEL
                         We're goosed.

                                     BOYD
                         We're not goosed.

                                     MOORE
                         What's goosed?

                                     BOYD
                         What is her disposition?

                                     FISHER
                         Regarding what?

                                     BOYD
                         Does she sound pissed, scared, 
                         hostile? Did she mention the police?

                                     FISHER
                         No, but she's definitely pissed and 
                         hostile. And she's clearly starting 
                         to think that's something's not right.

               Michael starts sobbing uncontrollably.

                                     MICHAEL
                         We're goosed! Goosed by God!

                                     BOYD
                         Michael get a grip.
                              (to Fisher)
                         What did you tell her?

                                     FISHER
                         I told her that I have no idea what 
                         Adam was talking about in that letter.

                                     MOORE
                         Did she believe you?

                                     FISHER
                         I have no idea.

                                     MOORE
                         You can tell when people believe 
                         you. It's obvious.

                                     FISHER
                         Well I don't have that skill and if 
                         I had to guess I would say that in 
                         no way did she believe me.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (screaming)
                         Goosed!

                                     BOYD
                         Stop it!

                                     MICHAEL
                         Goosed!

               People are staring.

                                     BOYD
                         Stop.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Goosed!

                                     BOYD
                              (to Moore)
                         Give me the Valium.

                                     MOORE
                         He just had two.

                                     BOYD
                         Give me two more.

               Moore counts out two Valium, hands them to Boyd as michael 
               continues to freak.

                                     BOYD
                              (to Michael)
                         Open sesame.

               Michael complies like a puppy.

                                     FISHER
                         Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.

                                     BOYD
                         Suck my ass.

               INT. LOIS' KITCHEN

               TIGHT ON Lois, busted nose, eyes black.

                                     LOIS
                         I never liked you Boyd. You're a 
                         snaky little fuck. Always have been.

               WIDE ON the guys, seated around a little breakfast table. 
               Michael's in a Valium stupor.

                                     BOYD
                         What are you talking about?

                                     LOIS
                         Don't sweet lip me.

                                     BOYD
                         I don't understand where this personal 
                         attack is coming from...

                                     LOIS
                         You're a liar. I want to know what 
                         happened in Vegas.

                                     BOYD
                         Nothing happened in Vegas.

                                     LOIS
                         I don't want to hear it from the 
                         liar. Stick a plug in it Boyd. Fisher? 
                         What happened in Vegas?

                                     FISHER
                              (beat)
                         Nothing happened in Vegas.

                                     LOIS
                              (not buying it)
                         Moore?

                                     MOORE
                              (sheepish)
                         Nothing happened.

               Michael starts back in with the power sobbing. All eyes are 
               on him. Guilty, uncomfortable silence. Michael's coming 
               unglued.

                                     LOIS
                         Michael? Do you have something to 
                         tell me?

                                     BOYD
                         Michael. Tell Lois that nothing...

                                     LOIS
                         Shut up Boyd! Michael?

               All eyes on Michael.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (quiet)
                         Goosed.

               Fisher struggles to breathe. Boyd tenses up.

                                     LOIS
                         What?

                                     MICHAEL
                         Lois we were bad, we were very, very 
                         bad.

                                     BOYD
                         He's upset about Adam. We're all 
                         upset.

                                     LOIS
                         I will call the police right now if 
                         I don't start getting some answers.

                                     BOYD
                         Lois please.

               She heads for the phone.

                                     LOIS
                         Fuck you Boyd.

               The guys are freaking as she picks up the phone. Boyd looks 
               at the kitchen knives. Fisher sees him, intervenes quickly...

                                     FISHER
                         Okay. Lois... here's the deal.
                              (beat)
                         Adam was with a prostitute in Las 
                         Vegas.

               Lois freezes, puts down the phone. Boyd and Moore look stunned 
               at Fisher -- good lie.

                                     LOIS
                         What?

                                     FISHER
                         I'm sorry he was unfaithful to you.

                                     BOYD
                         And it wasn't the first time... He 
                         had a thing about prostitutes.

               Fisher gives Boyd a look. Lois starts to choke up.

                                     LOIS
                              (crushed)
                         My Adam?

               Lois crumbles before their eyes.

                                     BOYD
                         We're sorry.

               Lois starts sobbing. Michael joins in. Adam Jr. and Timmy 
               appear in the door, in their pajamas, awakened by the noise. 
               Seeing their mother in tears, they start to sob. The room is 
               filled with anguished tears. Boyd give Lois a glass of water 
               and a Valium.

               EXT. LOIS' HOUSE

               Fisher and Moore load Michael into the car. Boyd leans into 
               the back window. Adam Jr. and Timmy are in the backseat, 
               still in their P.J.'s.

                                     BOYD
                         Mommy just needs a little time out. 
                         Everything's gonna be okay. Okay?
                              (the boys don't answer)
                         Okay.

               Fisher starts to get in the car, Boyd pulls him aside, very 
               wound up.

                                     BOYD
                         After you drop the kids off, take 
                         Michael home. Put a few drinks in 
                         him so he'll sleep.

                                     FISHER
                         I don't think that's such a good 
                         idea.

                                     BOYD
                         Just do it.

                                     FISHER
                         What are you going to do?

                                     BOYD
                         Take care of business.

                                     FISHER
                              (accusing)
                         What does that mean?

                                     BOYD
                         And what does that mean?
                              (off no response)
                         Are you insane?!
                              (whispers)
                         You think I would hurt Lois?! She's 
                         the mother of those kids! What is 
                         wrong with you?

                                     FISHER
                         I don't know...

                                     BOYD
                         You got a nasty side to your thought 
                         process.

                                                               TIME CUT TO:

               INT. FISHER AND LIZ'S HOUSE

               TIGHT ON Fisher.

                                     FISHER
                         I'm sorry. Honey... it's just for 
                         tonight.

               Liz is in her robe, none too pleased. Adam Jr. and Timmy sit 
               in the b.g. at the kitchen table eating cookies and milk.

                                     FISHER
                         Lois is a mess and Michael's really 
                         upset. Everyone's upset.

                                     LIZ
                         We're not canceling.

                                     FISHER
                         I know.

                                     LIZ
                         I won't even discuss it.

                                     FISHER
                         No one's discussing it. I'm just 
                         gonna run Michael home. I'll be right 
                         back.

                                     LIZ
                         I need you to pick up the cake 
                         tomorrow.

                                     FISHER
                         Don't we already have someone to do 
                         that for us?

                                     LIZ
                         Yeah. You.

                                     FISHER
                         Okay. Okay.

               Fisher kisses Liz and goes.

               INT. BAR

               Dark, smoky, MUSIC. Michael, Fisher and Moore sit in a corner 
               booth.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (finger in his ear)
                         Do you hear buzzing fish?

                                     FISHER
                         Buzzing?

                                     MICHAEL
                         Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. 
                         Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just 
                         chipping away in the back of my skull.

                                     FISHER
                         I don't hear it.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.

                                     FISHER
                         Have another drink.

               INT. ADAM AND LOIS' HOUSE - NIGHT

               TRACKING SHOT down hallway into bedroom where Lois sleeps 
               peacefully.

               INT. BAR - NIGHT

               Fisher and Michael. Moore, drinking, just listening.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Dad used to bring home these sparklers 
                         to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 
                         'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 
                         'em up to the sky and watch the 
                         explosions of light. Sparks. And dad 
                         would be all... "Get ready"... "watch 
                         for it"... "here it comes," here 
                         comes the "wahoo"

                                     FISHER
                         The wahoo?

                                     MICHAEL
                         The sparkler would burn hot, then 
                         hotter, then even hotter... and there 
                         would be one moment of pure burn 
                         when that little fucker would cook 
                         just perfect. Perfect. It would only 
                         last a second, but that second was 
                         it. It was it. That's what dad had 
                         us looking for... You get me?

                                     FISHER
                         The wahoo moment?

                                     MICHAEL
                         That's my point! You see Man... 
                         burning at his absolute. To see all 
                         the forces just come together, just 
                         right, you know, just in perfect 
                         harmony. That's what I'm driving at. 
                         You get me?

                                     FISHER
                         I think so.

                                     MICHAEL
                         I've been looking for that flash and 
                         I look and I look and I can't find 
                         it. And what if I already had it? 
                         You know. My moment? What if it's 
                         gone? And I never saw it?
                              (finishes drink)
                         You're getting married, man. That's 
                         a fucking beautiful thing. Just a 
                         beautiful thing. I just can't stop 
                         breaking beautiful things.

               INT. LOIS' HOUSE - NIGHT

               Lois' bedroom. As Lois sleeps, Boyd softly enters the room. 
               Moving in on the sleeping Lois, another couple of steps, he 
               looms over her, reaches his hand to her throat when, suddenly, 
               Lois' eyes snap open. Boyd is startled. Lois grabs mace from 
               her night stand and sprays Boyd in the face. He MOANS, 
               stumbles back. Lois leaps on him like a shark slamming a 
               side of beef.

               They go down hard on the floor and start fighting like wild 
               animals.

                                     LOIS
                         You picked the wrong woman mother-
                         fucker!

               As Lois sinks her teeth into Boyd's balls.

               BACK AT THE BAR

                                     MICHAEL
                         You see for me it's over. Over baby. 
                         I'm gonna turn myself in. After the 
                         wedding of course. After the wedding. 
                         Out of respect.

                                     MOORE
                         I don't think that's a good idea.

                                     MICHAEL
                         I said out of respect. Respect for 
                         you Fisher. For you and your wedding 
                         and your beautiful bride. There will 
                         be no more rain. You see where I am 
                         here?

                                     FISHER
                         I appreciate it. I do, but... maybe 
                         you ought to just ease up on yourself 
                         a bit.

                                     MICHAEL
                         No. No. No. This is my doing. You 
                         see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark 
                         for my own. For Lois and the kids, 
                         for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna 
                         turn myself in. I am all that. I'm 
                         gonna do it for sweet Lois.

               LOIS' BEDROOM

               Boyd and Lois are choking the living shit out of each other. 
               Boyd pulls back, swings with a left, Lois ducks, she swings, 
               a right cross to Boyds eye. He goes down. She jumps on him. 
               Choking him like a mad dog. As Boyd struggles for air...

               THE BAR

               Fisher checks his watch as Michael fumbles with his eighth 
               shot of Yukon Jack.

                                     MICHAEL
                         If I was to think... If I were to 
                         think... No I mean I have thinked it 
                         over... I have. And without putting 
                         a lot of pressure on you I just... 
                         Well I just...

                                     FISHER
                         What is it?

                                     MICHAEL
                              (drunk-slow)
                         Well if you do think about names... 
                         Michael's a pretty good one... It's 
                         done me all right.

               Michael's eyes bore into Fisher, like he knows something 
               Fisher doesn't. Fisher's cell phone RINGS.

                                     FISHER
                              (answers)
                         Yeah.

               INT. LOIS' BEDROOM

               TIGHT ON Boyd, eye swelling, scratch marks, hair a crazy 
               mess.

                                     BOYD
                              (into the phone)
                         Okay. Here's the deal and it's a 
                         good one. Lois is cool. It's a 
                         pacified situation.

               INTERCUT BOYD AND FISHER

                                     FISHER
                         What does that mean?

               Michael stares at Fisher.

                                     BOYD
                         I'm talking about Lois having relaxed 
                         her anxiety. Only deal is... you 
                         still got Michael there?

                                     FISHER
                         Yeah.

                                     BOYD
                         Good deal. Lois just wants to hear 
                         it from Michael.

                                     FISHER
                         Hear what?

                                     BOYD
                         That it was all an accident. She 
                         wants to here it from Michael's mouth.

                                     FISHER
                         Now?

               Michael drunkenly nods his head as if can hear the 
               conversation.

                                     BOYD
                         That's right.

                                     FISHER
                         Isn't it a little late?

                                     BOYD
                         Hold on a sec.
                              (turns)
                         Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather 
                         do this in the morning?

               PAN OVER to see Lois, half hanging off the bed, strangled to 
               death. Boyd won.

                                     BOYD
                              (back into phone)
                         She says now's the time.
                              (quietly)
                         I got a peace treaty thing happening 
                         over here... let's get this over 
                         with.

               EXT. LOIS' HOUSE

               Fisher's car pulls up. Boyd is waiting outside. He opens the 
               back door. Michael is drunk in the back. Fisher and Moore 
               are up front.

                                     BOYD
                         Okay Michael, let's go.
                              (helps him out)
                         Upsy daisy big guy.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (hammered)
                         How about my Fatburger?

                                     BOYD
                         Come on tough guy. Listen to me.
                              (takes Michaels face 
                              in his hands)
                         You are going to tell Lois that it 
                         was all an accident. Okay cowboy? 
                         You got me?

                                     MICHAEL
                         I love you.

                                     MOORE
                         He's too drunk.

                                     BOYD
                         He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go.
                              (to Fisher and Moore)
                         You guys stay here.

               Boyd leads Michael into the house.

               INT. CAR

               Fisher and Moore wait in silence...

                                     MOORE
                              (beat)
                         I'm thinking about maybe making a 
                         move.

                                     FISHER
                         A move?

                                     MOORE
                         Greenpeace.

                                     FISHER
                         Greenpeace?

                                     MOORE
                         Maybe go up to the North Pole, the 
                         Arctic. Tag polar bears with dart 
                         guns. I've always had a pretty good 
                         aim...

               A "POP" resounds from within the house. Moore and Fisher 
               lock eyes, frozen.

               Boyd comes jogging out the front door, hops in the back seat. 
               Fisher and Moore turn, eyes wide.

                                     BOYD
                         Michael was having an affair with 
                         Lois. That's what Michael and Adam 
                         were arguing about in the parking 
                         lot. Michael killed Adam in a jealous 
                         rage. Lois broke it off with Michael, 
                         he strangled her to death and then 
                         shot himself in the head.
                              (beat)
                         Happens all the time.

               Boyd touches the painful scratches on his face.

                                     BOYD
                         That Lois fought like a fucking 
                         Comanche.

               ON Fisher and Moore in stunned horror...

               INT. LAW FIRM

               TIGHT ON BARRY MORRIS, mid-40's, attorney.

                                     BARRY MORRIS
                         I don't see how this could have been 
                         kept from you. The facts are quite 
                         simple; last month Adam and Lois 
                         changed their will. They requested 
                         that you two, as a married couple, 
                         be the Custodians of Record for their 
                         estate including all properties, 
                         cash holdings, security holdings 
                         and... children. You are legal 
                         custodians of the Brenn Trust.

               ANGLE ON

               Liz and Fisher, flanked by Adam Jr. and Timmy, eyes wide, 
               they sit across from the attorney, totally bazooka'd. They 
               stare in horror at Morris.

                                     LIZ
                         My god.

                                     BARRY MORRIS
                         There's more.

                                     FISHER
                         More?

                                     BARRY MORRIS
                         Adam and Lois were not terribly 
                         prudent in terms of providing for 
                         the possibility of the unforeseen.

                                     FISHER
                         What are you talking about?

                                     BARRY MORRIS
                         I'm talking about Life insurance. 
                         I'm talking about money.

                                     LIZ
                         Money?

                                     BARRY MORRIS
                         Yes money. Adam had a five hundred 
                         thousand dollar Term Life Insurance 
                         Policy.

               PAUSE.

                                     LIZ
                         What does that mean?

                                     FISHER
                         That means we get five hundred 
                         thousand to help raise the kids.

                                     LIZ
                              (amazed)
                         No.

                                     FISHER
                         Yes.

                                     BARRY MORRIS
                         Actually, no. Adam was switching to 
                         a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled 
                         his medical exam... and failed to 
                         make his last payment... so his Term 
                         Life lapsed. So it's value is null 
                         and void.
                              (off Liz's horror)
                         Now he did have a pension account, 
                         worth another 150 thousand.

                                     LIZ
                              (relieved)
                         Well, oh...

                                     BARRY MORRIS
                         And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.

                                     LIZ
                         So where's that leave us?

                                     FISHER
                         150 plus 350... we still get 500 
                         thousand.

                                     BARRY MORRIS
                              (beat)
                         No. Not even close. With property 
                         values down, the house is worth 
                         100,000 less than 450 he paid for 
                         it. With three credit cards, the 
                         minivan payments, and other 
                         outstanding debts... Plus the Income 
                         and Estate Taxes assessed on his 
                         IRA...
                              (punches his calculator)
                         You'll get, oh... in the neighborhood 
                         of, ah... 14,223 dollars.

               Adam Jr. suddenly slips off his chair, lands flat on his 
               back, starts struggling to get up. Fisher tries to help Little 
               Adam up.

                                     LITTLE ADAM
                         Get away from me!

                                     FISHER
                         I'm just trying to help...

                                     LITTLE ADAM
                         I don't want your help!

                                     FISHER
                         Stop kicking. Stop kicking!

               Fisher manages to get Adam Jr. back up in his chair. Liz 
               looks rather horrified.

                                     BARRY MORRIS
                              (breaking the tension)
                         So. When is the wedding.

                                     LIZ
                         Tomorrow
                              (at Fisher)
                         We are getting married tomorrow.

               INT. CAR

               Fisher drives, Liz up front, Adam jr. and Timmy in the back. 
               Everyone is shocked in silence. Fisher looks deathly ill, 
               like he's about to vomit. He pulls the car over and gets 
               out.

               EXT. FISHER'S CAR

               Fisher leans on the trunk, puking. Liz gets out to help him, 
               he starts crying. Liz is gentle and loving.

                                     LIZ
                         It's okay... It's okay baby. Cry for 
                         Mama. Cry for Mama.

                                     FISHER
                         No it's not okay. It's not.

               The kids watch from the rear view window but can't hear.

                                     LIZ
                         Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay.

                                     FISHER
                              (sobbing)
                         Liz we've got to cancel, we have to 
                         put it off.

                                     LIZ
                              (ice)
                         Don't even.

                                     FISHER
                         Do you love me?

                                     LIZ
                         What?

                                     FISHER
                         Do you love me?

                                     LIZ
                         What kind of stupid question is that?

                                     FISHER
                              (breaking down)
                         Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a 
                         woman. We...

                                     LIZ
                         What are you talking about?

                                     FISHER
                              (completely hysterical)
                         Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Michael 
                         crushed her skull. She was dead. 
                         There was nothing else to do. It was 
                         an accident.

                                     LIZ
                         Who's dead?

                                     FISHER
                         The prostitute.

                                     LIZ
                         You fucked a prostitute?

                                     FISHER
                         No Michael did. It was an accident.

                                     LIZ
                         You killed a prostitute.

                                     FISHER
                         Michael, by accident.

                                     LIZ
                         Call the police.

                                     FISHER
                         It's too late.

                                     LIZ
                         My God. You've got to call the police, 
                         tell them it was an accident. Where 
                         is she?

                                     FISHER
                         She's in the desert. She's out in 
                         the desert.

                                     LIZ
                         You left a dead prostitute out in 
                         the desert? Alone?

                                     FISHER
                         She's not alone... She's... Boyd... 
                         Oh God... He's gone nuts... He killed 
                         Lois and Michael... it's all...

                                     LIZ
                         Stop! You stop right here. I don't 
                         want to know anymore. I told you not 
                         to do this Bachelor Party thing. You 
                         were warned.

                                     FISHER
                         But...

                                     LIZ
                         No buts. I told you your friends 
                         were Jackasses.

                                     FISHER
                         But...

                                     LIZ
                         No buts. I've waited twenty-seven 
                         years, twenty-seven years I have 
                         focused and prepared to walk down 
                         that aisle. I will not be derailed! 
                         I will not be embarrassed! I will 
                         not be denied! I am walking down 
                         that aisle tomorrow come hell or 
                         high fucking water!

               Liz marches back to the car, gets in and slams the door. 
               Fisher just stares in shock.

               EXT./INT. CHURCH - FISHER AND LIZ'S WEDDING

               It's pouring rain outside.

               Shots of guests dashing from their cars to the church.

               Fisher's parents with Adam Jr. and Timmy, looking overwhelmed.

               Upstairs: Liz and her Bridesmaids help Liz get dressed. 
               Everyone looks depressed.

               INT. CHURCH BASEMENT

               Fisher and Moore in tuxedos. Boyd enters, shuts the door. 
               Fisher looks ill.

                                     BOYD
                         Okay, we're about two minutes out. 
                         Moore, better take your position.

               Moore looks at Fisher.

                                     BOYD
                         Chop chop.

               Moore goes. A long tense BEAT between Fisher and Boyd.

                                     BOYD
                         This is a situation that defies 
                         judgement. We have acted and showed 
                         courage that is not of a kind known 
                         by most.

                                     FISHER
                         I'm getting really tired of your 
                         bullshit.

                                     BOYD
                         My what?

                                     FISHER
                         You've got a warped thought process. 
                         Your brain doesn't function properly.

                                     BOYD
                         You care to add a little specification 
                         to that slanderous accusation?

                                     FISHER
                              (snaps)
                         I'm talking about some bad, bad, 
                         very bad things. Bad things! Those 
                         are bad fucking things!

                                     BOYD
                         Okay fine.

                                     FISHER
                         Fine? Fine what?

                                     BOYD
                         Whatever you say Kojak.

                                     FISHER
                         I'm serious.

                                     BOYD
                         I'm serious. I'm the serious one 
                         here. I'm the one making the play. 
                         I'm the Indian Runner. And I want my 
                         money.

               INT. CHURCH

               The organ is playing. The guests are seated. Liz and her 
               father are waiting in the front hall.

                                     LIZ
                         I told Boyd two fucking minutes!

               INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - CONT'D

                                     FISHER
                         What money?

                                     BOYD
                         Blood money. Insurance dollars that 
                         you have thus fucking far decided 
                         not to tell me about at all. In no 
                         way have you mentioned that money. 
                         And I find that to be very very 
                         offensive.

                                     FISHER
                         You're sick.

                                     BOYD
                              (veins pulsing)
                         And if you think you can fuck me, 
                         don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated 
                         Fisher. Protected. Backed up on 
                         floppy. Do you get me? I want my 
                         fucking money!

                                     FISHER
                         Not a prayer.

                                     BOYD
                         I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up 
                         all night in the rain, in stormy 
                         gale force wind, tornado and fucking 
                         earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I 
                         stay lit. I don't go dark. I never 
                         go dark!

                                     FISHER
                         You need help.

               Fisher turns away. BOYD combusts. He leaps on Fisher with a 
               wild cry.

                                     BOYD
                         I want that money!

               Boyd and fisher fight like animals; choking, pounding, 
               mauling, a fight to the death. Fisher is losing, Boyd is 
               choking the life out of him, killing him. Fisher is going 
               down, eyes rolling back, he's dying, until...

               CRASH. Boyd's head is caved in from behind. REVEAL Liz 
               wielding a big, heavy crucifix. Boyd slumps to the ground. 
               Fisher gasps for air. Boyd stirs. Liz beats him repeatedly 
               with the crucifix until he's dead as a door knob. Fisher is 
               stunned. Liz tosses the cross. Miraculously, only one perfect 
               droplet of blood has gotten on her wedding dress. She flicks 
               it off with her finger.

                                     LIZ
                              (composing herself)
                         Here comes the bride.

               Liz gathers up her train and marches out. Fisher looks at 
               Boyd, a bloody dead mess.

               THE WEDDING

               Fisher joins Moore at the alter. JUDGE TOWER smiles warmly 
               at Fisher.

                                     MOORE
                         Where's Boyd?

                                     FISHER
                              (whispers)
                         Downstairs in the closet.

               Before Moore can ask, the ORGAN begins playing the WEDDING 
               MARCH. Liz starts down the aisle, escorted by her father, 
               She smiles radiantly.

               Liz's father kisses her and gives her to Fisher. They stand 
               before the Judge who starts talking. TIGHT ON Fisher. His 
               head pounding. He hears none of what the Judge says until...

                                     JUDGE TOWER
                         May we have the rings please?

                                     FISHER
                         What?

                                     JUDGE TOWER
                         The rings?

               Fisher looks at Moore.

               INT. CHURCH BASEMENT

               Moore opens the closet. Boyd falls out.

               INT. CHURCH

               Everyone waits patiently. Fisher is sweating. He looks at 
               Liz who stares straight ahead.

               INT. CHURCH BASEMENT

               Moore rolls Boyd over, checks every pocket, trying not to 
               get blood on himself.

               INT. CHURCH

               Moore returns.

                                     MOORE
                         Got 'em.

               He hands the rings to the Judge, at which time, he, she, 
               Fisher and Liz all see blood on his white shirt cuff. The 
               Judge looks at Moore. He pulls his jacket sleeve down.

                                     JUDGE TOWER
                              (continues)
                         These rings represent the commitment 
                         Fisher and Liz make to each other on 
                         the day. Fisher do you take Liz to 
                         be your beloved wife, to respect, 
                         honor and cherish till death do you 
                         part?

                                     FISHER
                         I do.

               Liz slides the ring on Fisher's finger.

                                     JUDGE TOWER
                         Liz do you take Fisher to be your 
                         beloved husband, to respect, honor 
                         and cherish him till death do you 
                         part?

                                     LIZ
                         I do.

               Fisher slides the ring on Liz's finger.

                                     JUDGE TOWER
                         I now pronounce you husband and wife.

               Fisher kisses Liz. They turn to face their guests who applaud. 
               Liz cries tears of joy.

               WEDDING RECEPTION - TENT NEXT TO CHURCH

               Liz drinks champagne and talks with her guests.

               EXT. CHURCH - REAR

               Fisher and Moore load Boyd's body in the trunk of Fisher's 
               car.

                                     MOORE
                         He came to me early today, was talking 
                         about money, insurance money. Said 
                         he was gonna get what was his.

                                     FISHER
                         My God...

                                     MOORE
                         He said he was the Brain Trust. Said 
                         he was smarter than all of us. He 
                         started reading "Atlas Shrugged," 
                         staring at himself in the mirror.

                                     FISHER
                         Did he try to kiss you?

                                     MOORE
                         All week long.

               Fisher slams the trunk closed.

               WEDDING RECEPTION - MUCH LATER

               Only a few guests remain. Fisher's parents watch the boys. 
               The caterers are cleaning up. Fisher and Liz sit alone.

                                     FISHER
                         He kept saying he was protected.

                                     LIZ
                         What does that mean?

                                     FISHER
                         Like if something happened to him, 
                         he could still get us.

                                     LIZ
                         Like how?

                                     FISHER
                         I don't know. He could have told 
                         someone. He could have, like in the 
                         event of his death, somehow let 
                         someone know where those bodies are 
                         buried.

                         The only proof is those bodies.

                                     FISHER
                         So what do we do?

                                     LIZ
                         Move the bodies.

                                     FISHER
                         Move the bodies?

                                     OLD MAN (O.S.)
                         Excuse us?

               Fisher and Liz look up at a sweet OLD COUPLE, who talk at 
               the same time, oblivious to each other.

                         OLD MAN
                 We just wanted to say 
                 congratulations and 
                 wish you great 
                 happiness. Mazeltov. I 
                 just did. I said 
                 Malzeltov. You never 
                 listen to me.

                                                       OLD WOMAN
                                               We're your Uncle Henry's 
                                               parents. Opal and Earl. 
                                               Tell them from both of us. 
                                               Malzeltov. Wish them luck. 
                                               The secret to a good 
                                               marriage is to listen.

                                     LIZ
                              (cheerleader smile)
                         Thank you. Thank you. We will. Bye 
                         bye.

               The Old Couple shuffles away. Fisher watches them go, he 
               suddenly breaks down, crying...

                                     FISHER
                         I... Liz... all I ever wanted, was 
                         for you to be happy. I just wanted 
                         to give you the wedding, the life 
                         you always dreamed of...
                              (sobs)
                         ...I just love you so much... So 
                         much...

                                     LIZ
                              (beat; unmoved)
                         You and Moore move the bodies and 
                         bury Boyd with them. In fact, put 
                         Moore in the ground too.

                                     FISHER
                         What?

                                     LIZ
                         If you don't tie up all the lose 
                         ends it'll never be over.

                                     FISHER
                              (horrified)
                         No...

                                     LIZ
                         You put him down or don't bother 
                         coming back.

                                     FISHER
                         But...

                                     LIZ
                         Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?!

               OFF Fisher...

               EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               Fisher's car blasts past a road sign reading, "Las Vegas, 
               358 miles."

               INT. FISHER'S CAR

               Fisher drives, Moore's in the passenger seat. They're still 
               in their tuxedos. Extreme silence. Fisher, almost in a trance.

                                     MOORE
                         You alright?

                                     FISHER
                         Yeah. I'm thinking about Michael's 
                         Franco Harris fixation. You know how 
                         Michael was always harping "Immaculate 
                         Reception?" I've seen that play. A 
                         lot of times... and I have to say 
                         this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, 
                         right place, right time. That's it. 
                         He was where the ball bounced. You 
                         get me?

                                     MOORE
                         I guess.

                                     FISHER
                         I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You 
                         work your entire life, all the 
                         training, focus, all the dedication, 
                         all irrelevant. Where does the ball 
                         bounce? My father spent his whole 
                         life trying to start a company, 
                         practiced every day, worked like a 
                         dog, finally got enough money. He's 
                         paid the dues, he's ready, does all 
                         the market research, picks his shot -- 
                         "Pup Corn."

                                     MOORE
                         Pup corn?

                                     FISHER
                         That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie 
                         treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's 
                         figured it out. There is a hole in 
                         the market and he's going to fill 
                         it. Spends all out money, works 
                         himself into not two but three heart 
                         attacks getting this shit up. After 
                         fifteen months, the big day arrives, 
                         the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off 
                         the belt. He comes running home with 
                         that box, pulls us out of school. We 
                         all pile into the living room, must 
                         be fifty of us, and in comes 
                         "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here 
                         Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got 
                         that little fucking pup corn in his 
                         hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat 
                         anything, she eats rocks, anything. 
                         She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks 
                         down at the little pellet, licks it 
                         once, turns around, walks out of the 
                         room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." 
                         Fifteen months of my dad's life, 
                         right there. Not one dog ate Pup 
                         Corn. Not one. Three months later, 
                         "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. 
                         My father never got over it. Never.

               SILENCE hangs again.

               EXT. DESERT - LATER

               Fisher and Moore search for the graves of Tina and Ralph 
               with flashlights and shovels.

                                     FISHER
                         I think it was over here.

               They move into a new area and start poking around. Nothing.

                                     MOORE
                         It was over by those rocks.

               Again they search, prodding into earth with their shovels. 
               Nothing.

               Fisher stops digging, tired, he pauses, shines his light 
               around until...

                                     FISHER
                         There.

                                     MOORE
                         Where?

               Fisher moves to a new spot.

                                     FISHER
                         There. This rock is where I stood 
                         when I said the prayer.

               He starts digging in front of the rock. The earth is soft.

                                     FISHER
                         Bingo.

               Moore and Fisher quickly start to dig, until, finally, Moore's 
               shovel makes contact.

                                     MOORE
                         Got it.

               And they dig some more.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               MOORE

               in the hole, passing the suitcases up to Fisher.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               FISHER

               loads the cases into the car.

               EXT. NEW BURIAL SITE

               The suitcases are unloaded. Fisher and Moore dig a new grave. 
               Moore's back is to Fisher as he digs.

                                     MOORE
                         I've been thinking about what you 
                         said that day. The prayer. About 
                         using this whole mess to bring out 
                         the good in me...

               Fisher is directly above Moore, holding the shovel, looking 
               down at the back of Moore's head.

                                     FISHER
                         Yeah?

                                     MOORE
                         I think there's a lot of truth in 
                         that. I'm gonna pursue some options. 
                         I want to join that Big Brother thing.

                                     FISHER
                              (slowly raises the 
                              shovel over his head)
                         That's a good one.

                                     MOORE
                         I want a black one. A little black 
                         brother. That's a big problem it 
                         seems to me. Lack of racial 
                         integration. That's a big one. You 
                         think?

               Moore looks up to...

               FISHER, tears running down his face, the shovel high above 
               his head, ready to bring it down hard onto Moore's skull.

               MOORE confused and then realization... CUT between Fisher 
               above, poised to strike, Moore below, still and vulnerable. 
               Their eyes locked for several beats. Finally...

                                     MOORE
                         What do you think?

               Slowly, Fisher lowers his shovel.

                                     FISHER
                         I think you'd make an excellent Big 
                         Brother.

                                     MOORE
                              (back to work)
                         That's what I'm thinking.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               Moore re-fill the grave with dirt we...

               INT. FISHER'S CAR - HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               Fisher drives, Moore rides shotgun, both mean are dirty, 
               sweaty and tired.

                                     MOORE
                         Well that ought to be about the end 
                         of that.

                                     FISHER
                         Yup.

               TIGHT ON Fisher, staring deep into the road, a faint smile 
               creeps on to his face...

               jockey shorts, Tonka trucks, mess everywhere.

               O.S. we hear voices outside. Liz gets up off her knees, 
               brushes a piece of hair from her sweaty face and peers out 
               the bathroom window.

               TIGHT ON FISHER

               EXT. BACK YARD

                                     FISHER
                         Okay let's try it again.

               Adam Jr. and Timmy, in ill-fitted Cub Scout uniforms, recite 
               the "Scout Laws."

                         TIMMY
                 A scout is thrifty, 
                 saves for the future. 
                 A scout is clean, he 
                 keeps his body...

                                                       ADAM JR.
                                               A scout is brave. A scout 
                                               can face danger, even if 
                                               he's afraid...

                                     FISHER
                         Let's see the salutes!

               Timmy snaps out a fine salute. Adam balances on one crutch 
               to salute but looses balance and falls flat on his face. He 
               starts SCREAMING.

               REVEAL Fisher, in a wheelchair, both legs amputated above 
               the knee. He leans over, trying to help Adam Jr. up and his 
               wheel chair tips over. Fisher falls on top of Adam Jr. who 
               SCREAMS even louder, flailing arms and legs like a turtle on 
               its back.

               REVEAL Moore, in an electric wheel chair he operated with a 
               mouthpiece. As he is paralyzed from the neck down, he's no 
               help at all. Timmy suddenly snaps.

                                     TIMMY
                              (to Adam Jr.)
                         Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

                                     FISHER
                         It's okay, it's okay.

               THE BATHROOM WINDOW

               Liz watches the pathetic chaos that is her life with the 
               dull lifeless eyes of a concentration camp prisoner.

                                     FISHER (O.S.)
                         Timmy SHUT UP! Help your brother! 
                         ADAM! Let him help you!

               TIGHT ON Liz as her mouth slowly opens in an anguished SILENT 
               SCREAM.

               OUT THE WINDOW - DOWN IN THE BACK YARD

               Adam Jr. gets back on his feet, with the begrudging help of 
               Timmy. As Fisher struggles to hoist himself up, back in his 
               wheelchair...

                                     FISHER
                         Remember a scout is helpful! A scout 
                         doesn't scream in the face of 
                         adversity.

               Suddenly, O.S. from the bathroom, Liz WAILS. Fisher looks up 
               at the window... LONG BEAT...

                                     FISHER
                              (to the boys)
                         Okay, let's skip to the Scout's 
                         Oath...

                                     ADAM JR. & TIMMY
                         On my honor, I will do my best...

               The boys recite the "Scout's Oath" as Liz's deep, heaving, 
               wailing SOBS grow in intensity O.C.

                                     ADAM JR. & TIMMY
                         ...to do my duty to God and my 
                         country... To obey the Scout Law, to 
                         help other people at all times...

               SLOWLY PULL OFF Fisher, Moore and the kids...

                                     ADAM JR. & TIMMY
                         To keep myself physically strong, 
                         mentally awake, and morally straight.

               CRANE UP, past Liz at the window, out of the yard, over the 
               house, WIDER to reveal the surrounding track-like homes, 
               housing track-like families, with track-like nightmares as 
               Liz's plaintiff wails echo the communal despair of the human 
               village.

                                                              CUT TO BLACK:

FADE IN:

A CARD, WHITE ON THE BLACK SCREEN, READS:

            Why does a dog wag its tail?

BENEATH IT, THE NEXT LINE FADES IN:

            Because a dog is smarter than its tail.

CROSS-FADE TO THE NEXT CARD, WHICH READS:

            If the tail were smarter, the tail would wag the dog.

FADE IN:

EXT THE WHITE HOUSE NIGHT

A VAN FULL OF PEOPLE STOPS AT A SIDE ENTRANCE.

ANGLE INT THE WHITE HOUSE

AT THE SIDE, UTILITY ENTRANCE, WE SEE THE DISGORGING WORKING-CLASS MEN AND
WOMEN, THEY PASS THROUGH SECURITY SCREENING IN THE B.G., THROUGH METAL
DETECTORS, AND PAST SEVERAL GUARDS WHO CHECK THE PHOTO-I.D.'S AROUND THEIR
NECKS.

AMES AND CAIN HAVE STOPPED AT THE END OF THE HALL.  BEYOND THEM WE SEE THE
CLEANING PEOPLE COMING IN FROM THE VAN, AND BEING CLEARED THROUGH A METAL
DETECTOR INTO A HOLDING AREA, AND HANDED CLEANING MATERIALS, MOPS, VACUUMS, ET
CETERA, BY A TYPE HOLDING A CLIPBOARD.  PART OF THE GROUP, A MAN IN HIS
FORTIES, IN A RATTY JACKET, OPEN COLLARED SHIRT, PASSES THROUGH THE GROUP,
AND IS STOPPED BY A SECRET SERVICEMAN WHO APPEARS NEXT TO AMES.  IN THE B.G.
WE SEE A TV IN AN ADJACENT ROOM, SHOWING A POLITICAL COMMERCIAL.

                    (TO SECRET SERVICEMAN)
            ...That's him.

AMES MOVES OUT OF THE SHOT.  LEAVING US ON THE POLITICAL COMMERCIAL.

WE SEE TWO BUSINESS PEOPLE ON THE PLANE, A MAN AND A WOMAN.

            Well, all I know, you don't change horses in the middle
            of the stream.

                          BUSINESSWOMAN
            "Don't change Horses," well, there's a lot of truth in
            that.

WALK HURRIEDLY.  AMES FINISHES ONE CIGARETTE AND USES THE BUTT TO LIGHT A

SHAKE HANDS WITH ONE OF A LINE OF GIRLSCOUTS.  AMES GLANCES UP AT THE
PHOTOGRAPH AND SHAKES HIS HEAD DEJECTEDLY.

HE STOPS TALKING AS A WHITE HOUSE WAITER ENTERS WITH A TRAY WITH COFFEE THINGS
ON IT, FOLLOWED BY TWO YOUNG AIDES, SLEEPY AND DISHEVELLED, WHO ENTER QUICKLY,
AND APOLOGIES UNUTTERED, SIT AND MAKE THEMSELVES SMALL.

BREAN MAKES A LITTLE GESTURE AT THE WAITER, WHO IS SETTING OUT THE COFFEE,
AND AT THE STENOGRAPHER, MEANING "GET THEM OUT OF HERE."

            When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean.

            What's the thing?  You people get ahead, you sure get
            nervous.

AN AIDE ENTERS, WITH SEVERAL TYPED SHEETS, WHICH SHE HANDS TO CAIN. CAIN

            please...

                          BREAN
            Okay, look, who's takin' the press conference today?

                          CAIN
            Is there a press conference today?

                          BREAN
            What do you think?  What I need from you:  I need a
            base of operations.  Some place in the District.  I
            need some clean money ...

                          LEVY
            How much...?

AMES GESTURES HIM TO BE QUIET.

                          BREAN
            And, to hold it together, I need two days.  There is no
            B-2 Bomber:  here's what you do ahout that:  whoever is
            leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip,
            "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program..."
            "What B-2 Program, and why should it screw it up?"  "If
            the president moves to deploy the B-2 before it is
            fully tested."  "Deploy the B-2, Why?"  "In the
            Crisis."

                          AMES
            What crisis?

                          BREAN
            I'm working on it.  Same time, you call Billy Scott at
            Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane right now to
            Seattle, y'got that...?  All flustered and worried. To
            talk to the Boeing people.

                          AMES
                    (TO LEVY)
            Do it...

LEVY MOVES TO A TELEPHONE.

                          BREAN
                    (TO CAIN)
            And you?

                          CAIN
            But there isn't a B-2 bomber.

                          BREAN
            Where'd you go to school, Kid.  Wellesly?

                          CAIN
            Dartmouth

                          BREAN
            Then show a little spunk.  There Is no B-2 Bomber,
            General Scott, the best of your knowledge, is not in
            Seattle to talk with Boeing...

                          AMES
            It won't hold.

                          BREAN
            One day, Two days?  Course it's gonna hhhh....

                          BREAN
            We don't need it to prove out.  We need it to distract
            them for two weeks til the election.

                          AMES
            What would do that...?

HOLD, ON BREAN THINKING.

                          BREAN
            I'm working on it.

HE TURNS AROUND AND STARES AT THE WALL.

BREAN WALKS TO THE COUNTER WHERE THE COFFEE AND ROLLS ARE STEAMING.  ON THE
WALL ARE HUNG TWO WIPE-OFF SLATES.  ONE READS "DAYS TO ELECTION 12," THE OTHER
READS "% IN FAVOR 63" BREAN PICKS UP A ROLL, DOWNS A COFFEE, AND STARTS OUT OF
THE DOOR.

            It's the rough-cut, the other side's new commercial.

THE PICTURE COMES ON, IT SHOWS THE PRESIDENT DOING SEVERAL PRESIDENTIAL
THINGS.  THE COMMERCIAL WE SAW EARLIER.

                          BREAN
            That's our commercial.
                    (PAUSE)

                          BREAN
            We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the
            "appearance" of a war.

                          AMES
            I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of
            a war.

            world slept, expecting news from the President on Trade
            and his visit to China, another sort of news, however,
            has emerged from the Presidential Quarter.  Chris

            I'm sure that's the worst of it.
                    (BEAT)

                          WOMAN

                          BREAN
            Well, it ain't over til it's over...

AMES SITS IN THE SEAT NEXT TO BREAN.

                          BREAN
            How's he doing?

AMES SHUSHES BREAN, TAKES OUT THE AIRPHONE, AND STARTS DIALING.

THE TWO POOL ATTENDANTS STRAIGHTEN, AND PUT ON THEIR BEST SMILES, AND LOOK AT AN
ARRIVING MAN.

                          POOL ATTENDANT
            Morning, Mr. Moss.

STANLEY MOSS, A SUCCESSFUL LOOKING FELLOW AROUND SIXTY, COMES THROUGH THE
TURNSTILE, ONE OF THE ATTENDANTS BUSTLES AROUND, HANDING HIM TOWELS.  WE HOLD
ON THE SECOND ATTENDANT, WHO SCURRIES UP THE STEPS.

                          SECOND ATTENDANT
            ...I'll be right back with your juice...

MOSS CALLS AFTER HIM

                          MOSS
            ...with a carrot in it...

AS HE CLEARS THE FRAME, WE SEE, BELOW HIM, MOSS AND THE FIRST ATTENDANT, WHO
IS GESTURING DOWN TOWARD THE POOL AREA, THEY TURN THEIR HEADS.

ANGLE
DOWN AT THE DESERTED POOL AREA.  ONE NANNY TYPE, WITH A YOUNG KID IN
WATERWINGS, FROLICKING IN THE WATER, AND BREAN, AND AMES, WHO ARE SITTING IN
POOL CHAIRS.  BREAN RISES, AND WALKS TO GREET MOSS, LEAVING AMES IN THE B.G.
TALKING ON A CELL PHONE.

ANGLE
ON MOSS AND BREAN, AS MOSS APPROACHES A BIT TENTATIVELY.

                          MOSS
            Do I know you?

                          BREAN
            We have some mutual friends in Washington.

INT POOL CABANA, BEV. HILLS HOTEL, DAY.  A CURTAIN IS SWEPT ASIDE, AS MOSS
AND BREAN AND AMES ENTER, IN THE B.G. WE SEE THE NANNY AND THE LITTLE KID IN
THE POOL.  MOSS AND BREAN ARE TALKING AS THEY ENTER.

                          MOSS
            And is it true?

                          AMES
            Waal, Mr. Moss, I wouldn't....

MOSS STARTS STRIPPING OFF HIS CLOTHES, AND CHANGING INTO A SWIMSUIT.

                          MOSS
            You wouldn't be here if it wasn't true.  It's true,
            right?

HE SWITCHES ON THE TELEVISION IN THE CABANA.  WE SEE A FEMALE TALKING HEAD.

                          FEMALE TALKING HEAD
            Sexual relations with a girl thirteen years old.

THE SCREEN GOES TO THE PHOTO OF THE PRESIDENT WITH THE GIRLSCOUTS.

MOSS TURNS DOWN THE VOLUME.  AS HE AND BREAN TALK THE TV SHOWS IMAGES OF THE
PRESIDENT WITH GIRLSCOUTS, AND WITH OTHER YOUTH GROUPS.

                          MOSS
            And you're here why...?

                          BREAN
            I'm here, Mr. Moss, because you've shown yourself a
            great supporter of the Party.

                          MOSS
            Party's gonna need more than a couple bucks now.

THE POOL ATTENDANT ENTERS WITH A TRAY ON WHICH IS A GLASS WITH LIQUID AND A
CARROT STICK IN IT, AND A GLASS FULL OF CELERY STICKS.

                          MOSS
            Back where I come from they call this Romeo in Joliet.
                    (HE SHAKES HIS HEAD, REACHES ONTO A
                    SMALL TABLE BEHIND HIM, AND PICKS UP A
                    BOOK.)
            I, I, and y'know, I like the guy... he signed his
            book to me....

HE HOLDS THE BOOK TO BREAN, THE CAMERA SEES THE PHOTO OF THE PRESIDENT ON THE
BACK COVER, THE FRONT COVER READS.

            ".... FOR TWO GENERATIONS TO AGREE."

MOSS LOOKS DOWN AT THE BOOK, AND QUOTES

                          MOSS
            "For Progress to occur, it is necessary for Two
            Generations to Agree...."

HE LOOKS AT THE TELEVISION SCREEN, WHICH SHOWS THE PRESIDENT WITH A YOUNG GIBL
ON HIS LAP.

                          MOSS
            Oh, jeez, this guy is fucked.

                          BREAN
            What one has to do, Mr. Moss.  Is to fight a holding
            action.

                          MOSS
            ...holding action.  THEY'RE GOING TO TEAR THIS GUY TO
            Shreds.

                          BREAN
            If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til
            the election, we...

                          MOSS
            Yeah, hut you can't hold the dam.  How the hell,
            n'nu'n', I don't get what you want me to ...

THE SCREEN CHANGES, WE SEE THE SEAL OF THE PRESIDENT, AND WE ARE IN THE
NEWSROOM OF THE WHITE HOUSE.  A SHOT OF THE RESTIVE REPORTERS, IN THE B.G.
OF THE CABANA WE SEE THE POOL ATTENDANT TAKING HIS LEAVE, HURRYING BACK TO
THE OTHER TELEVISION AT THE POOL DESK.

                          ANNOUNCER
                    (VO)
            Allegations that the president had sexual... Ah...
            here is the deputy ... assistant under secretary...

WE SEE LEVY TAKE THE PODIUM, ARRANGE HIS NOTES, AND CLEAR HIS THROAT.

BREAN LEANS FORWARD, ANXIOUS, IN HIS SEAT.

                          MOSS
            I don't ... they're gonna tear this guy to shreds...

                          LEVY
                    (ON TV)
            ...the illness of the President, which we are assured,
            is not serious.  I repeat, it is not serious, the
            doctors suspect it's a stomach flu, but have advised
            him not to fly.  He will remain, on the ground, in
            China for, they estimate, one or two days, I stress
            that, during this time he will, of...

                          MOSS
            ...he's gotta come back sometime, what the hell is two
            days gonna buy him.

            Any questions....Mr. Sklansky, Yes...

                          MOSS

            ... twelve year old girl...  Breir Rabbit couldh t gut
            outta this...

ANGLE, ON BREAN AS HE LOOKS AT MOSS, LEANING INTO THE TV.  HE THEN
SWITCHES HIS GLANCE TOWARD THE POOL DESK, ANGLE HIS POV.  AT THE POOL DESK
WE SEE THE TWO ATTENDANTS, THE NANNY, THE KID AND SEVERAL NEWLY ARRIVED
BATHERS CLUSTERED, RAPT, AROUND THE TELEVISION.

                          LEVY
                    (C)  (VO)
            Yes...?

            Mr. Levy...

                          LEVY
                    (VO)
            Yes

                          SKLANSKY
            Would you comment on the rumors... on the rumors that
            the President's trip, that the President's delay... is
            due to the situation in Albania?

ANGLE
ON THE TELEVISION WE SEE SKLANSKY, AND SEE THAT HE IS THE CHAP IN THE
BATHROBE WHOM BREAN GAVE THE ENVELOPE TO.

                          LEVY
            There, uh, I'm not aware of the situation to which you
            refer.

                          SKLANSKY
            Sir:  the heads of the Albanian Desks at C.I.A., and at
            the National Security agency have been recalled on
            Special Alert, and there are rumors that the B-2
            Bomber...

                          LEVY
            Mr. Sklansky, Mr. Sklansky, I am I am unaware of any,
            um, "situation..."  The B-2 Bomber?
                    (PAUSE)
            The B-2 Bomber...?  There is no B-2 Bomber.  Mrs.
            Rose...

A WOMAN REPORTER STANDS.

                          MRS. ROSE
            Mr. Levy, early this morning Major General William
            Scott flew to Seattle.  Is his trip connected with the
            B-2 Bomber?

                          LEVY
            Uh...Mrs. Rose, there, to the best of my knowledge,
            there is no...

                          REPORTER
            Mr. Levy:  is the situation in Albania in any way
            connected with recent Muslim Fundamentalist, anti-
            American...

BEAT.  MOSS LOOKS AT BREAN.

                          MOSS
            How close are you to this thing?

BREAN PICKS UP A CELLPHONE FROM THE TABLE, AND DIALS

                          BREAN
                    (TO MOSS)
            What do you want the kid to say?

MOSS LOOKS AT BREAN APPRAISINGLY.

                          MOSS
            Have him say, 'I know we're all concerned for the
            President, there will he an update at 5:45.'

AS MOSS SPEAKS BREAN NODS TO AMES, SPEAKS INTO THE TELEPHONE.

                          AMES
                    (INTO PHONE)
            Have the kid say I know we're all concerned for the
            President.  There will he an update on his
            condition at 5:45.

THEY BOTH TURN TO WATCH THE SCREEN.

                          LEVY
                    (ON TV)
            ...no information whatever on Fundamentalist...
                    (HE HOLDS HIS HAND TO HIS EARPHONE)
            I.  I just want to say I know we're all conceroed for
            the President, there will be an update on his
            condition at five forty-five...

MOSS LEANS OVER AND TURNS DOWN THE VOLUME ON THE TV.
BEAT.

                          MOSS
            Well.  You bought yourself one day.  Maybe two.

                          BREAN
            String a few together.  All I need's eleven,

                          MOSS
            How you going to stretch it?
                    (HE GESTURES AT THE TV)
            This won't hold for eleven days.  Guy fucked a twelve-
            year-old...whadday're gonna do to hold that off?

                          BREAN
            What do you think would hold it off?

                          MOSS
            Uh, nothing, oh, nothing ... uh... a War, uh...
                    (HE PAUSES, THEN LOOKS AT BREAN WITH
                    COMPREHENSION.)
            You're kidding.

BREAN SHAKES HIS HEAD NO.

                          MOSS
            I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?

                          BREAN
            I'm gonna tell you why...

BREAN LEANS CONSPIRATORIALLY, OVER TOWARD MOSS.

                          BREAN
            Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight.
            What does that mean?

                          MOSS
            Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh...

                          BREAN
            Remember the Maine...

                          MOSS
            That's from the ... it's got to be from the...

                          BREAN
            Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!

                          MOSS
            ...uh ... No, that's...

                          BREAN
            We remember the slogans, we can't even remember the
            fucking wars.  Y'know why.  Cause it's show business.
            That's why I'm here.  Naked girl, covered in Napalm.
            Five marines Raising the Flag, Mount Suribachi.
            Churchill, V for Victory, Y'remember the Picture, fifty
            years from now, they'll have forgotten  the war.  Gulf
            War?  Smart Bomb, falling through the roof.  2500
            missions a day, 100 days, One Shot of One Bomb.  The
            American people bought that war. M'I getting through
            to you?  War in the Balkans, don't mean nothing, till
            some G.I. flyer, went down, Eating Snakes for Ten days.
            N'then It's show business, Mister Moss.  That's why
            I'm here.

ANGLE
AT THE POOL DESK. THE ATTENDANTS AND THE GUESTS ARE WATCHING THE TELEVISION.
ON WHICH WE SEE COMIONTATOR TALKING ABOUT A MAP OF ALBANIA.

THE SCENE SHIFTS TO THE SHOTS OF THE PRESIDENT BEING PRESIENTIAL, AND WE
HEAR, "THANK HEAVEN, FOR LITTLE GIRLS..."
AMES WINCES, WE SEE THE POOL ATTENDANTS LAUGH.

                          BREAN
            It's like being a producer, Mr. Moss.  The Things in
            Trouble.  Somebody's got to wade in, save the thing.
                    (PAUSE)
            You get the Actors get up there, and strut and
            Posture.  But somebody, knows what's what, got to jump
            in and Save the Thing.
                    (PAUSE)

THEY LISTEN TO THANK HEAVEN, FOR LITTLE GIRLS, AND THEY LOOK AT MOSS.

PAUSE

                          MOSS
            Why Albania?

                          BREAN
            Why not?

MOSS NODS DECISIVELY.  AS IF TO SAY, "BY GOLLY, NOW YOU'RE TALKING..."

                          MOSS
            Pat? Pat?

ONE OF THE ATTENDANTS RAISES HIS HEAD FROM THE TV AND SPRINTS OVER TO THE
CABANA, WHERE WE SEE MOSS AND BREAN DEEP IN CONFAB.  MOSS GESTURES TO THE
TRAY WITH THE JUICE AND THE CELERY.

                          MOSS
            ...throw this shit out.  Gemme a pot of coffee and a
            packet of Camels.

INT MOSS'S HOME, AFTERNOON.

A GREENE AND GREENE BUNGALOW IN THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS, AMERICAN ART POTTERY
ALL AROUND.  MOSS IN BLUEJEANS AND A HAWAIIAN HAT, PACING BACK AND FORTH,
SMOKING LIKE A CHIMNEY.

                          MOSS
            But at some point they gotta know.

                          BREAN
            Who?

                          MOSS
            The...
                    (HE GESTURES OUT OF HIS WINDOW,
                    MEANING, "THE PUBLIC")

                          BREAN
            "They Got To Know?"  Stan...?  Get with it.  Who Killed
            Kennedy...?  I read the first draft of the Warren
            Report, said he was killed by a Drunk Driver.  You
            watched the Gulf War.  What did you see?  Day after
            day, the one "Smart Bomb" falling into a building.
            The truth, I was in the building when they shot that
            shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia,
            1/10th scale model of a building.

                          MOSS
            Is that true?

                          BREAN
            How the fuck do we know.  You take my point?

                          MOSS
                    (SHAKING HIS HEAD)
            ...going to War...

                          BREAN
            It's not "war."  It is a Pageant.  It's a Pageant...
            Like the Oscars... why we came to you...

                          MOSS
            I never won an Oscar.

                          BREAN

BREAN GLANCES AT A FOODSTORE, WHERE WE SEE A LONG LINE OF PEOPLE WAITING TO BE
ADMITTED, AND A VAST LINE INSIDE, AT THE CHECK OUT COUNTER, THEIR CARTS PILED
HIGH, THE SHELVES BEHIND THEM DENUDED.

THEY PASS BY A SHOESTORE, CLOSED, A PLYWOOD SCREEN IN FRONT, COVERED BY A
SIGN:  SOON TO REOPEN UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT.  BREAN FOLLOWS AMES, INTO THE
STORE.

INT SHOESTORE NIGHT.  MANY YOUNG STAFFERS.  A VAST SIGN READS:  DAYS TIL
ELECTION 8. % IN FAVOR?

THE STAFFERS STAND IMMOBILE, AS BREAN, AMES, AND THE SECRET SERVICE TYPES
ENTER.  ON A TELEVISION, UNWATCHED BEHIND THEM.  A FOREST SCENE, A SQUAD OF
SERVICEMEN IN WOODLAND CAMO, LOOKING DOWN AT A RIVER, THEIR LEADER SPEAKING
SOFTLY INTO A MICROPHONE.

                          LEADER
            ...scared.  Sure we're scared.  But th'fella said the
            trick is not minding that it hurts.  N'Ill tell you one
            thing:  They might get into the U.S.A., but they'll
            have to get in over Mrs. Kelly's son...
                    (HE TAPS HIMSELF ON THE CEEST)

THE SCREEN GOES TO A SCENE OF SUPERMARKET LOOTING IN AN INNER CITY.  A STAND-

            ...dead and fifteen wounded in these first hours of the
            War.  They are not, they are not The Enemy, they are
            people, like You and Me, a different kind of Victim of
            Albanian Aggression, but Victims Nonetheless...

SEE A SOB-SISTER TYPE

                          SOB SISTER REPORTER TYPE
            ...fighting, yes, but fighting for what?

THE SCREEN IS FILLED WITH THE PHOTO OF THE YOUNG ALBANIAN WOMAN, WHO IS NOW
HOLDING TWO CATS.

                          SOB SISTER REPORTER TYPE
            For this.  For this.  For Freedom, for safety -- yes,

BREAN HEARS A WHOOSH, AND TURNS TO LOOK BACK AT THE SCREEN OF THE JETS TAKING

            you entertain an offer of marriage for your son Saul,
            from Princess Margaret of Great Britain.  Well, they
            think, she isn't Jewish, but she's well to-do, a nice
            old family.  Alright, yes, they say.  We would
            consider such an offer.  Wonderful, matchmaker says,

            ...just having heard her family shot.  For the crime of
            non-cooperation with Albanian Authorities.  Apparently,
            they had a family connection in Canada, along the US
            border and refused to exploit it to aid the Terrorists
            to infiltrate this country.
                    (BEAT)
            They paid with their lives.

            of a splash you want to make, how long you want them to
            Go Away for.

            Oh, MiGod.

BEAT, MR. YOUNG SHAKES HIS HEAD SADLY.

                          MR. YOUNG
            Guess who I am.

                          AMES
            I'd like to mention a few names, who...

                          MR. YOUNG
                    (LOOKING AT NOTES HE IS HANDED BY
                    YALIE)
            I know who you are, Mr. Ames.

                          AMES
            I was acting as a Private Citizen.  Nothing that I've
            done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or
            intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to
            believe I am connected with.
                    (PAUSE)
            Or in whose employ...

                          MR. YOUNG
            Quite touching.

                          AMES
            And I take this opportunity to suggest that, equally,
            I admit to nothing, and that I would like my lawyer
            present.

MR. YOUNG NODS.

                          MR. YOUNG
            Guess what?  We show, and N.S.A. confirms, there are no
            nuclear devices on the Canadian border.
                    (PAUSE)
            There are no nuclear devices in Albania.  Z'at put us
            in something of a pickle?
                    (PAUSE)
            Albania has no nuclear capacity.  Our spy satellites
            show "no secret terrorist camps" in The Albanian
            Hinterland.  The F.B.I. and the Border Patrol, And the
            R.C.M.P. report no repeat no untoward activity along
            our picturesque Canadian Border.  The Albanian
            Government is screaming its innocence, the world is
            listening.

                    BRIDGE)
            Course there's a war.  I'm watching it on Television.

                          MR. YOUNG
            N'who might you be, when all's said and done?

                          BREAN
            My name is Ronald Brean.

                          MR. YOUNG
            Who're you working for?

                          BREAN
            Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I
            promise you.

                          MR. YOUNG
            S'all very well, but when the Fit hits the Shan,
            somebody's going to have to Stay After School, and who
            do you 'spose that might be.

                          BREAN
            S'only got to hold for another few days.

                          MR. YOUNG
            Well, I'm not interested in how long its "got to hold
            for."

                          BREAN
            What are you interested in?

                          MR. YOUNG
            I'm interested in the Security of My Country, Mr.
            Brean.

                          AMES
            As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to
            suggest that the Security of the country would be ill-
            served by any, any...any...

PAUSE.  THEY LOOK AT HIM.

                          AMES
                    (CONT.)
            Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...

                          MR. YOUNG
            And I think that the Security of the Country would be
            best-served by its citizens obeying its laws.
                    (OVER HIS SHOULDER, TO AN AIDE)
            Gemme a Federal Judge, gemme search-warrants, all
            premises controlled by our friends, and bench-warrants

                          BREAN
                    (SIMULTANEOUSLY, WITH THE ABOVE SPEECH)
            Well, I'm sure that speaks very well of you and for
            your parents.  But if forced to choose between the
            security of the country and the security of your Job,
            which would you pick.  And, while you hesitate, permit
            me to suggest that they are one and the same.  Your
            country and your job.

                          MR. YOUNG
            I'm doing my job, Mr. Brean.  That's what you see me
            doing here.  What is it you thought you were doing?

                          AMES
            And I'd like to point out that I've been on
            prescription medication, the side-effects of which...

                          BREAN
            I'm doing my job, Too.
                    (OF THE AIDE)
            Would you give me a... do you think you could call off
            your Dogs for a minute.

PAUSE.  MR. YOUNG LOOKS AT THE AIDE, WHO IS EXITING, AND NODS.  THE AIDE STAYS
BEHIND.

                          BREAN
                    (CONT.)
            Thank you.

                          MR. YOUNG
            What's on your mind?

                          BREAN
            I have a question for you.

                          MR. YOUNG
            Ask it.

                          BREAN
            Why do people go to war?

                          MR. YOUNG
            Why do people go to war?

                          MR. YOUNG
            I'll play your silly game.

                          BREAN
            Why do they go to War?

                          MR. YOUNG
            To preserve their Way of Life.

                          BREAN
            Would you go to War to do that?
                    (PAUSE)

                          MR. YOUNG
            I have.

                          BREAN
            Well, I have, too.  Would you do it again...?  In't
            that why you're here?  I guess so.  N'if you go to war
            again, who is it going to be against?  Your "ability to
            fight a Two-ocean War" against who?  Sweden and Togo?
            Who you sitting here to Go To War Against?  That time
            has passed.  It's passed.  It's over.  The War of the
            Future is Nuclear Terrorism.  It is and it will be
            against a Small Group of Dissidents who, unbeknownst,
            perhaps, to their own governments, have blah blah blah.
            And to go to that war, you've got to be prepared.  You
            have to be alert, and the public has to be alert.
            Cause that is the war of the future, and if you're not
            gearing up, to fight that war, eventually the axe will
            fall.  N'you're gonna be out in the street.
                    (PAUSE)
            And you can call this a "drill," or you can call it
            "job security," or you can call it anything you like.
            But I got one for you:  you said, "Go to War to protect
            your Way of Life,"  well, Chuck, this
                    (HE GESTURES AROUND THE ROOM)
            is your way of life.  Innit?  And if there ain't no
            war, you can punch out, go home, and take up Oil
            Painting.  And there ain't no war but ours.

            face the charges, the heinous charges brought against
            him.  You know, folks, there is nothing in life as

IN THE B.G. AIRFORCE ONE IS ROLLING TO A STOP.  WE SEE THE RAMP COME DOWN AND
THE PRESIDENT COME OUT IN THE RAIN AND HURRY TOWARD A WAITING HELICOPTER.

HE SEES SOMETHING OFF TO THE SIDE AND STOPS, HIS AIDES TRY TO DISSUADE HIM,
BUT HE PULLS AWAY.  THE NEWS CAMERA HUNTS AND FINDS A SMALL ALBANIAN GIRL,
CARRYING A SHEAF OF WHEAT IN HER HANDS, AN OLD WOMAN BEHIND HER, BOTH STANDING
IN THE RAIN.  THE PRESIDENT ADVANCES, AND MOVES TO LET HIS AIDES LET THE CHILD
COME FORWARD.  WE SEE THE PRESIDENT, MOVED AT THE SIGHT OF THE LITTLE GIRL,
OFFERING HIM THE SHEAF OF WHEAT, WE HEAR A REPORTER, V.O.

            to speak English, but my Grandmother...

THE CAMERA MOVES ONTO THE GRANDMOTHER, STANDING, NODDING, BEHIND THE LITTLE
GIRL, AND THE PRESIDENT, REALIZING FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THE OLD WOMAN IS
STANDING IN THE RAIN, MOVES TO HER, REMOVES HIS SUITCOAT, AND PLACES IT OVER
HER HEAD.  SHE CLASPS HIM TO HER BOSOM.  SHE SPEAKS TO HIM IN ALBANIAN.

                          TRANSLATOR

 BREAN             What about it?

 AIDE             For Schumann.

 BREAN             Inaugural Speech, press corp's gonna be jealous of
            giving up that one...

 MOSS             Hey, lemme close out the thing in style.

 MOSS             I've come to feel It's my thing.
 (PAUSE)             You know, you take a job... You take a job, and, many
            times, it's just a job.  And then...

AS THEY CONCLUDE, THE BASKETHALL PLAYERS TAKE OFF THEIR SHOES, AND FLING THEM INTO THE STANDS, WHICH CHEER. 
ANGLE BREAN, MOSS, AND AMES, IN A SKYHOX, WATCHING THE SPECTACLE. BREAN SHAKES HIS HEAD IN SATISFACTION. 
 MOSS             No business like it.

THEY WALK OUT OF THE BOX.

ANGLE MOSS AND BREAN LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW. 
ANGLE, THEIR POV. EVERY TREE AND LAMPPOST HAS A PAIR OF OLD SHOES HANGING IN IT. 
ANGLE INT THE LIMO. BREAN, MOSS, AND AMES, BREAN NODDING, DEEP IN THOUGHT. THE RADIO IN THE LIMO IS PLAYING AN AUDIO VERSION OF THE "DON'T SWITCH HORSES," COMMERCIAL.

 MOSS             Fucking amateurs.  Pity of it is, two more days, we
            bring it all back home...

 MOSS             And who's gonna know?
 (PAUSE)             Who's gonna know what we did.
 (PAUSE)             Who's gonna know...?

 BREAN (SHRUGS)             Pride of a job-well-done...

 AMES             It's the Pride of a Job Well Done, Stanley, yes, but
            it's more than that.

 MOSS (DISTRACTED)             ...mmm?

 AMES             It's the gratitude of your party, and of your
            President...

 MOSS             Izzat the thing...

 AMES             Indeed it is.

MOSS LOOKS OUT OF THE WINDOW. 
ANGLE, OUT OF HIS WINDOW. AN L.A. VIADUCT, IN THE POURING RAIN, SPRAY PAINTED, WITH A HUGE MURAL OF SCHUMANN, AND THE WORDS, "COURAGE, MOM..." 
 BREAN (ON HIS PHONE)             Dean City, Oklahoma...

MOSS LOOKS OUT OF THE WINDOW, AT THE MURAL. LOOKS OVER IN ADMIRATION AT BREAN. 
 MOSS             I'll bet you're good at Chess.

 BREAN             I would be, I could remember how all the pieces move...

INT CORPORATE JET NIGHT.

 CO-PILOT             Little rough weather.

 AMES (AS THE PHONE COMES BACK ON)             To wait on the Congressional Medal for Schumann.  Moss
            and Brean think, and I agree, why spend it til you need
            it.

CAMERA TRAVELS UP THE CABIN AGAIN, WITH THE CO-PILOT. 
 CO-PILOT             We're seeing some difficult weather out of Oklahoma --
            but the captain thinks that we'll be fine.

 BREAN (TALKING ON THE TELEPHONE)             Against...who could be aggressor....Help me out
            here...Units of 303, the Defense Department confirms,
            early this morning, Albanian Time, stormed a mountain

            no casualties.  His condition is reported as Guarded,
            and his route to the US has not been disclosed, but a
            high White House source confirms he is expected in
            Washington tomorrow morning...no, that's for the wire
            service.  Moss's working on Big Bird's Inaugural.
 (PAUSE)             Nine A.M...?
 (TO MOSS)             Nine?  Miss the commuters, but...

            Lookit:  it's like a girl with her virginity,

MOSS NODS ALONG. 
 BREAN (CONT)             Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he might, but why
            take a chance?  Hold out til after you're married.
            That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann,
            make em vote for hhhh.... psychologically, they will
            understand that that's the bargain.  Make them pay for

            Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is
            flying home, he's here, he's there... f'there the
            election, TA DA, here he is.

            hour.  If you help ... if you help, a hundred bucks an
            hour.

 MOSS             Hey, lcokit:  any business...

 BREAN             Ain't that the truth.
 (PAUSE) 
 MOSS             Whattaya gonna do when this is all over?

 BREAN             What am I gonna do?  I'm gonna "Fade Away."

 MOSS (LAUGHS)             Well, I'll be damned if I know ... you know... doing

            Language?  It's ïretirement."  What the hell was I

BREAN NUDGES HIM, TO LOOK AT THE TV. 
THEY SETTLE BACK, LOOK AT THE TV. 
ANGLE, ON A TV, A COUNTRY MUSIC SPECTACULAR. WILLIE NELSON IS CALLED TO THE STAGE, SITS ON HIS STOOL, PLAYS A FEW BARS FOR NOTHING, AND THEN A RENDITION OF "COURAGE, MOM."

 WILLIE NELSON             "What have you got at the end of the day?  How do you
            keep those fears at bay?  What do you say, when there's
            nothin' to say?  Courage, Mom..."
 (ET CETERA)

 MOSS (TO HIMSELF)             ...the Albanian Campaign.  This... this is history...

AMES COMES UP FROM THE BACK OF THE PLANE. 
 AMES             ...The Albanian Campaign...

 MOSS             ...like the sound of it, eh...

 AMES             We've got to put that, into the Inaugural.  "I have
            here, a ribbon.  You haven't seen it before, and you
            will not see it too often now.  For it is the Proud
            Possession of a few, a very few Men and Women... it is
            the Ribbon of the Albanian Campaign...."

THE OTHER TWO LOOK AT HIM ADMIRINGLY. 
 MOSS             Wilfred, that's not bad.

 BREAN             That's not bad at all.

 AMES             Well, you know, "The Whole Thing's Theatre..."

THE OTHER TWO MEN LAUGH WITH HIM. 
 BREAN             Napoleon said, fellow won't sell you his life, but he
            will trade it to you for a little piece of ribbon.

 MOSS             ...the Albanian Campaign.
 (PAUSE)             And we won't even be a footnote...

 BREAN             We were the Albanian campaign, John -- We Were There.

HE CLEARS HIS THROAT. HE LOOKS OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW. WE SEE A MILITARY CONVOY APPROACHING. THE DOOR TO THE COCKPIT OPENS, THE PILOT GOES OUT. 
 PILOT             Gentlemen, little problematical weather.

 BREAN             Well, c'n we get him back home?

 PILOT             Could if we had to.  Rather not.  Rough weather.

BREAN AND MOSS GET UP, MOVE TOWARD THE FRONT OF THE PLANE, MOSS LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW. 
 MOSS             Well, they're protecting him well enough.

 BREAN             They should be.  Most valuable animal since Sea
            Biscuit.  Isn't he...

 MOSS             Bigger than that.  For want of a nail a Kingdom was
            lost...

 BREAN             You've got something, there...

 AMES (WRITING)             Napoleon said -- A man will not sell you his
            life...

 AMES             Uh...Didn't we do this?

 BREAN             Never quit a winner.

 MOSS             I thought they weren't meeting him at the airport...

 BREAN             They insist they wanna go with meeting him at the
            airport.  I told'em they're wrong, I can't convince'em.
            They're concerned that the last kid had the Wheat.
            Variations include, the kid is a boy, the kid is twins,
            it's a little dog ... they rub meat on Schumann's cuff,
            the dog runs to him...

 MOSS (OF SCHUMANN)             Uh...

 BREAN             ...how ya doing?

MOSS TAKES THE CLIPBOARD, AND READS, WHILE AMES SITS STUNNED. 
 SCHUMANN             Fine.

MOSS HOLDS UP THE MILITARY DIRECTORY.

 MOSS             I think we asked for "special programs" and they gave
            us "special prisons."

 BREAN             Yeah, well -- it's only one word difference.

AMES DRAWS MOSS ASIDE.

 AMES             What happens if he doesn't have his medication?

 MOSS             He's not fine.

ANGLE THE PLANE, IN A VIOLENT RAINSTORM, BUCKING WILDLY. AMES, ON HIS KNEES, GATHERING UP THE PILLS, REPLACES THEM IN THE VIAL, SHAKES OUT TWO, AND GIVES THEM TO SCHUMANN. WHO TAKES THEM. MOSS THEN STRAPS HIMSELF BACK IN AND BREAN CONTINUES TALKING ON THE TELEPHONE. 
THE THREE STRAPPED IN, THE PLANE TOSSING WILDLY. BREAN ON THE PHONE. 
 SCHUMANN             You gonna git me back tomorrow?
 (PAUSE)             Cause they havin beans tomorrow...

 BREAN (ON THE PHONE) (HE PICKS UP A BOTTLE OF SCOTCH AND STARTS DRINKING FROM IT.)             A slight, a slight, well, no, we're gonna deal with it,
            we just, I need a little readjustment...we need to
            rethink...

 MOSS             Yes, William, Uh, we have this thing we're doing...

 SCHUMANN             Long's you git me back for the beans...

 MOSS             ...for the beans, yes...

 BREAN (ON THE PHONE)             We're gonna, just, may have to call off the...

HE GESTURES AT THE SILENT TELEVISION, WHERE WE SEE THE SIGNS OF THE SCAFFOLDING, SIGNS READING, "WELCOME HOME OLD SHOE," ET CETERA...
            Well, maybe, you know, ah, ah, he's sicker than we
            thought, and rush him under wraps to Walter Reed to do
            a complete...

 SCHUMANN (TO AMES)             R'if y'r gonna keep me out, I'd kinda like the chance,
            t'go to church...
 (HE LEANS TOWARD AMES AND WINKS LASCIVIOUSLY, AND NUDGES HIM IN THE RIBS) 
 AMES             Oh Lord.  What have you done to me?  What have you done
            to me...?

 BREAN             Wilfred.

 AMES             ...what have you done to me...

 BREAN             All Combat takes place at night, in the Rain, and at
            the Junction of four Map Segments...

 AMES             ...what are we going to do...?

 MOSS             He's fine, as long as he gets his medication.

 BREAN             Speaking of that...
 (HE LOOKS AT THE VIAL)             We're gonna need a whole lot more of this....

 AMES             Well, get on the phone, and get it...

 MOSS             You know, I think you people are looking at this All
            Wrong.  If you look at the backstory -- the guy's
            coming back from Combat and Torture.  Of course he is
            gonna be ... uh ... uh ... "fucked up".  Of Course he's
            gonna "need a little help"...
 (GESTURES PUTTING A HYPODERMIC IN HIS ARM) 
 AMES (TO HIMSELF)             Oh, Lord....

ANGLE, ON THE TV, WHERE WE SEE THE PRESIDENT, WEARING AN OLD SHOE BUTTON.

 PRESIDENT             ...a proclamation of a Day of National Rejoining...

THE TELEVISICN GOES ALL FUZZY, THEN CONKS OUT.             ...a day of Humility, a day of Pride...in the Return

 SCHUMANN             N'ybody gotta Beer...?

THE LIGHTS IN THE PLANE FLICKER, AND THEN COME ON, WE SEE THE LIGHTENING FLASHING OUT OF THE WINDOW, THE CO-PILOT COMES BACK INTO THE CABIN... 
 BREAN (ON THE PHONE)             Just....do what I ...look:  get me a ...hello...?
            Hel...?  I'm going to need an ambulance, we take him,
            the last moment, right from the Pl...no, we land, we

            somebody else off that jet...what the fuck do I care?
            Somebody in a Hospital gown.  And we need a
            ......hello?  Hello...?

THE LINE GOES DEAD. 
 BREAN             Cause I don't think this dog is gonna hunt....

 MOSS             He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?

 BREAN             Yeah, well, perhaps...
 (TO PHONE)             Speaking of which:  I have a prescription here, I'm
            going to give you the number, I need you standing by
            with a crate of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?

 MOSS             An anti-psychotic...

 BREAN (TO TELEPHONE)             It's an anti-psychotic, the num...  the
            number...hello...hello...

BEAT. THE BUFFETING STOPS. THE CO-PILOT ENTERS. 
 CO-PILOT             We have been experiencing some buffeting, but I think
            from here on out, it's going to be fine.

HE RETURNS TO THE COCKPIT. BREAN TRIES TO REDIAL THE TELEPHONE. 
 SCHUMANN             Long's I git back for my Beans.

 MOSS             This is nothing,  Wait'll you've worked with a movie
            star, one time, this is nothing, we keep him shot-up
            and happy -- the Old Days, I used to think I was a
            pharmacist, the kind of stuff I had to do.  One time...

 SCHUMANN             Cause the beans, y'know, y'can tell if they're puttin
            stuff in it.

 BREAN             Uh huh...

 SCHUMANN             So you don't have to fear it.

 BREAN             Uh huh...

 MOSS             Mmm.

 BREAN             What kind of stuff?
 (TO PHONE)             Hello...?

 SCHUMANN (PAUSE. SCHUMANN LOOKS AT THEM WARILY)             What do you mean, "What kind of stuff?"

 AMES             No, no, he didn't mean anything at all...

 BREAN (TO MOSS)             Give'em another pill...

 AMES             No.  No.  He didn't mean anything by it at all...

 BREAN (TO PHONE)             Hello?   No, operator...

MOSS ADMINISTERS A PILL TO SCHUMANN. 
 SCHUMANN             What the fuck did you mean, "What kind of stuff?"?

 MOSS (TO BREAN)             ...this is nothing.  This is nothing. D'you ever shoot
            in Italy?  Try three Italian starlets on Benzedrine,
            this is a walk in the park...

 SCHUMANN (AS IF COMING TO)             ...who are you?
 (PAUSE)             Who are you sonofabitches...
 (HE LOOKS AROUND WILDLY) 
 AMES             We're just, actually, we're friends of... can we get
            another pill into him...

 SCHUMANN             Where are you taking me...?

 BREAN (TO PHONE)             Hello...?

A HUGE FLASH OF LIGHTENING, THE PLANE IS PLUNGED INTO DARKNESS, THE ENGINES STOP: 
INT THE DARK CABIN. THE WIND WHISTLING. 
 AMES (SOFTLY)             Oh, Heck.

DISSOLVE 
EXT A FIELD IN MONTANA. THE WRECKED CORPORATE JET. 
ANGLE A BEATEN-UP BREAN STRUGGLES FROM THE PLANE, FINISHING A BOTTLE OF SCOTCH, HE FLINGS IT FROM HIM, REACHES IN HIS BACK POCKET, OPENS ANOTHER, AND, AS HE DOES SO, HE SINGS DRUNKENLY. 
 BREAN             "Hush little baby, don't say a Word...Pappa's gonna buy
            you a Mockingbird, if that Mocking bird don't sing,
            Poppa's gonna buy you a diamond ring..."

AMES, SIMILARLY BRUISED, STUMBLES FROM THE PLANE BEHIND HIM. 
 BREAN             ...kid complains, kid cries, gets more junk, junk don't

 (HE REACHES BACK INTO THE PLANE, AND BRINGS OUT A SMALL TELEVISION SET) 
ANGLE, AS HE LEANS INTO THE PLANE. WE SEE MOSS, LYING IN A HEAP, MOSS COMES TO. 
 MOSS             ...what happened...?

 BREAN             I think we were experiencing a Little Technical
            Difficulty.

 MOSS             How's our friend?

BREAN SETS UP THE TELEVISION. TURNS IT ON. HE SITS, AND TAKES THE BOTTLE FROM BREAN, AND DRINKS. 
 MOSS             ..."Courage.  Mom"...

BREAN HAS KICKED THE TELEVISION INTO LIFE, WE SEE A MAN AND WOMAN ANCHOR, SPEAKING LUGUBRIOUSLY, INTO THE CAMERA. 
 BREAN             News.  Like a Wedding Cake.  Tons and tons of sticky
            sugar, Barbie and Ken on top...
 (HE HITS THE TV)             Can't ya Talk, you sonofabitches...?

 MOSS             What the hell do we care?

 BREAN             Eh?  I'm like the Rest of America.  I don't care -- I'm
            just addicted to it...

A PHOTO OF SCHUMANN COMES ON THE TELEVISION. BREAN STUMBLES BACK INTO THE PLANE, AND HAULS THE DAZED SCHUMANN OUT, AND PROPS HIM AGAINST THE PLANE. 
 BREAN (TO SCHUMANN)             N'just when everything was going so well...

HE SIGHS. HE LOOKS AT THE TELEVISION SCREEN. 
ANGLE THE CROWDS AT ANDREW'S AIRKORCE BASE, THE "OLD SHOE" BANNERS, THE "COURAGE, MOM," BANNERS. THE STILL BAND. A SHOT OF THE BANDMASTER, SURREPTITIOUSLY, GLANCING AT HIS WATCH. 
 MOSS             How's our friend?  What is he, "dead?"

 BREAN             Wake up.

 MOSS             Is he dead?

 AMES             Is he dead?
 (PAUSE)             Is he dead?  ARE YOU DEAD?  WAKE UP.  You stupid, nun-
            raping sonofoabitch.... wake up...  WAKE UP.  Do you
            want to spend the rest of your life in JAIL?  WAKE UP!
            Do You Know Who I AM???  I'm talking to you...

SCHUMANN BEGINS TO ROUSE BIMSELF. 
 SCHUMANN             Z'it time for Exercise?
 (PAUSE)             Cause it's my Day on the Yard.

 BREAN             Courage, Mom.

 MOSS (PAUSE)             This is nothing. ...piece of cake.  Y'know, producing
            is being a Samurai Warrior.  They pay you, day in, day
            out, for Years, so that, ONE DAY, when called upon,
            you can respond, your training At Its Peak, and save
            the day.

ANGLE BREAN, SHAKING HIS HEAD. IN THE B.G., MOSS, DRINKING. THE TV COMES TO LIFE. 
 COMMENTATOR             ...long overdue, its absence unexplained.

THE NEXT SHOT IS SENATOR BUD NOLE, SPEAKING EARNESTLY AT THE CAMERA. 
 NOLE             ...this...regrettable absence... this ...tardy absence
            of the flight.  Must give us pause.  And, in that pause
            we should take time to examine ourselves, our plans,
            and our future.  There has been an ...interregnum -- if
            you will, of reason, while we've watched unfold this
            drama..... on the world scale...

 AMES (TO HIMSELF)             ...I hate this cocksucker...

 NOLE             And, now, end how it will, this drama is done...

ANGLE MOSS, AS HE WANDERS BACK TO STARE AT THE SCREEN. THE VAST FIELDS STRETCHING AWAY IN THE DISTANCE 
 NOLE (C)             The drama is done, and we must pause to consider.
 (HE HOLDS UP A PHOTO OF THE PRESIDENT)             And we must consider this man.  This man...who, you
            will remember, was discovered, scant days ago, in a
            situation which must debar him from Public Office...
 (HE HOLDS UP A SHOT OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE GIRLSCOUTS)             And I say, when we take time to reflect, there're going
            to be a lot of apartments for rent in Washington,
            Election Day.  Two days from now, Folks...Don't forget
            to vote.

 MOSS             No, I didn't think so.

AMES KICKS IN THE THLEVISION. HE MOVES TO SCHUMANN AND LIFTS HIM TO HIS FEET. 
 BREAN (DRUNKENLY)             Leav't alone.  Wha'd television ever do to you?  Ate
            your life, ruin'd your Culture, but...

AMES FINISHES DESTROYING THE TV. 
 AMES             IT DESTROYED THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.        

HE FINISHES RAGING AT THE TELEVISION SET. PAUSE. 
 MOSS             Come on.

 AMES             ...where?

 MOSS             Come on.

MOSS MOVES SCHUMANN INTO A STANDING POSITION. 
 BREAN             Y'know what else bothers me?  "Shh lil baby, don' saya
            word, papa's gon buy you a mocking bird..."
 (PAUSE)             The baby don'say a word, WHAT THE FUCK IS THE
 MOTHERFUCKING MOCKING BIRD GONE SAY? (PAUSE)             You follow me...?

 MOSS             Get on your feet, boy.

 BREAN             Uh huh...why?

 MOSS             We're going home.  We're going home together...

 BREAN             We have no home.  We're vagrants.  N'each man's hand's
            against us.  We killed Old Shoe...
 (HE BEGINS TO WEEP)             We killed the Schuster...spend our life in a
            packingcrate...Where are you going...?

MOSS STARTS CODDLING SCHUMANN. 
 MOSS             Come on, Pal, come on Willie, come on, Old Shoe...

 SCHUMANN             Just want to take a nap.

 MOSS             He's not dead, Ronnie.  He's just a little
            understandab1y, fatigued.
 (PAUSE)             Let's get him to some help...

 SCHUMANN             ...gimme some help...

 MOSS             That's right, we'll take a nap.  We'll get you to
            Washington, we'll get you Back to your Buddies, and...

 SCHUMANN             ...just want to Get Back to the Beans...

MOSS WALKS TO BREAN, AND STARTS KICKING HIM. 
 MOSS             Come on, you fucking sissy, you think this is tough?
            Try show-business.  1970-1990, n'ybody I worked with,
            y'could of bottled their piss n'sold it in the

 (TO SCHUMANN)             Come on, Pal...

 BREAN             I'm tired.

 MOSS             Finish Strong!  Are you nuts?
 (HE STARTS SHEPHERDING THE TWO ACROSS THE VAST WHEATFIELD)             Are you nuts?  This's Pennies from Heaven... on his
            triumphal return home, Old Shoe, his Plane Forced
            Down...AND YET...

 BREAN             He's supposed to be flying in from Europe.

 MOSS             We'll deal with that when we come to it.  This is
            producing.  This is what they pay off on...come on,
            Pal, Boots and Saddles...

 AMES             ...his Triumphal Plane.  Shot Down.

 MOSS             Shot down, Forced down...

 BREAN             And what the fuck story are you gonna tell?  The guy is
            a nutcase.

 MOSS             You would be, two, if you'd gone through what he went
            through.

 BREAN             He raped a Nun...

 AMES             But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?

 MOSS             How do we explain that?  Ah, well, you see, Wilfred,
            this is where you've never been at a pitch.  You see?
            His records say he was in prison ... as they must, as

 FIRST MEDIA GUY             Yes, you could say that, Joyce, but it wouldn't be
            true.

 JOYCE             What would be true, then.

 SECOND MEDIA GUY             Well, you  said it yourself, earlier, and if I may
            rephrase, that the success of the President, in the
            Polls...

 JOYCE             ...as of today, 89% favorable.

 SECOND MEDIA GUY             Eighty-nine percent favorable, is based not on
            events...
 BREAN             ...events.

 SECOND MEDIA GUY             Which, of course, we cannoy control....

 SECOND MEDIA GUY             By the  media, by, yes, by, in this case, our
            organization.

 JOYCE             Well, there's a lot to be said for that.  And I'm
            going to show a clip.
 (TO THE AUDIENCE)             You've seen it before, you've seen it many times...
 (ALL SMILE)             But I'm going to ask you to look at it once more.  With

            The American "people"?

                          AMES
            Yes

                          BREAN
            Who's gonna tell'em.

                          AMES
            ...but...

                          BREAN
            What did they find out about the Gulf War?  One shot:
            one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been
            made of Legos.

HE ROLLS OVER AGAIN.

                          AMES
                    (AS IF REHEARSING IT TO HIMSELF)
            ...you want us to go to War...

BREAN ROUSES HIMSELF, SHRUGS, TAKES OUT A NOTEBOOK, AND BEGINS TO WRITE.

                          BREAN
            ...that's the general idea.

                          AMES
            Why?

                          BREAN
            Why not, what've they ever done for us...?  Also:  they
            sound... Ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize
            the B-2 Bomber...

                          AMES
            ...they sound what?

                          BREAN
            Shifty.  Who knows anything about em...

                          AMES
            Hold on, hold on, hold on:

                          BREAN
            Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this
            election, you better change the subject.  You wanna
            change this subject, you better have a War.  What do
            you need?  It's gotta be quick, it's gotta be dramatic,
            you got to have an enemy.  Okay?  What do you need in
            an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear?
            Som'b'y you don't know.

                          AMES
            Who?

                          BREAN
            Well, I'm working on it....

HE ROLLS OVER.

EXT, O'HARE AIRPORT.  BUSINESS TERMINAL.

A BEAUTIFUL PRAIRIE DAWN.

THE SMALL PLANE FINISHES TAXIING, BREAN AND AMES EMERGE, A UNIFORMED
OBSEQUIOUS AIRLINE ATTENDANT COMES UP, AND HANDS THEM TICKETS.

ANGLE, ON BREAN AND AMES, AS THEY WALK ACROSS THE TARMAC.

                          AMES
            Albania...

                          BREAN
            Yes.

                          AMES
            Why?

                          BREAN
            What do you know about them?

                          AMES
            ...nothing...

                          BREAN
            Precisely.

                          AMES
            What did Albania ever do to us?

                          BREAN
            What did they ever do for us...?
                    (PAUSE)
            You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2
            Bomber.

                          AMES
                     (TO HIMSELF)
            ...you want us to go to War with Albania.

                          BREAN
            Here's what you got to do:

            Get your Press Office, Right now.  To deny;  There is
            no report of Albanian Activity.  They have to deny it.

INT AIRLINE WAITING AREA.  DAY.

EARLY MORNING BUSINESSMEN AND WOMEN, HOLDING COFFEE CUPS.

ONE WEARS A CAMPAIGN BUTTON SHOWING THE PHOTO OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE GIRL
SCOUT.  HE BRUSHES PAST BREAN WHO IS SITTING BY A MINDLESS TELEVISION WEATHER
PRESENTATION ON A HUGE TV.  HE LOOKS DOWN AT HIS WATCH.

THE BUSINESS TYPES BEGIN TO QUEUE UP IN A SLEEPY LINE.  BREAN LEANS CLOSER TO
THE TELEVISION, AS IT CHANGES TO A NEWS LOGO, AND A TALKING HEAD APPEARS.

                          TALKING HEAD
            Good morning:  With the election eleven days away the
            world slept, expecting news from the President on Trade
            and his visit to China, another sort of news, however,
            has emerged from the Presidential Quarter.  Chris
            Andrews, station KCRT, Santa Fe Reports:

BREAN LEANS BACK FROM THE TELEVISION, AND PUTS HIS ATTENTION ON THE BUSINESS
PEOPLE ABOUT TO FILE ONTO THE PLANE.  AS HE WATCHES THEY MOVE FIRST ONE AT A
TIME, AND THEN, IN A GROUP, DRAWN TO THE TELEVISIONS.

ANGLE:
BREAN, LOOKING AT THE BUSINESS PEOPLE, CLUSTERING UP.  BEYOND HIM, WE SEE THE
TALKING HEAD FROM SANTA FE, THE SHOT OF THE PRESIDENT WITH THE GIRLSCOUTS,
WHICH WE SAW PREVIOUSLY ON THE WHITE HOUSE WALL, AND ON THE CAMPAIGN BUTTONS.

BREAN TAKES OUT A NOTEPAD AND STARTS MAKING NOTES.  AMES WANDERS INTO THE
SHOT, WITH A CUP OF DUNKIN' DONUTS COFFEE, AND THE CELLPHONE INTO WHICH HE IS
TALKING.

                          AMES
            Top people.  Albanian Desk.  Well, I don't know either,
            but we probably have one.  Albanian Dusk, C.I.A.,

                    (CONT.)
            And you tell the staff, anyone leaks anything on this
            situation, his or her job is going to be...

THE TWO ARE IN THE QUEUE THROUGH THE JETWAY.  THEY COME TO THE DOOR OF THE
AIRLINER.

                          AMES
                    (CONT.)
            ...General Scott in Seattle...?  No, I don't think his
            trip has got anything to do with the B-2 Bomber.
            Now...

THE STEWARDESS INTERVENES, AS THEY COME UP TO THE DOOR OF THE AIRLINER

                          STEWARDESS
            I'm sorry, Sir, I'll have to ask you to...

SHE GESTURES AT THE CELLPHONE.
AMES LAGS BEHIND IN THE JETWAY, AS BREAN WALKS INTO THE PLANE, CAMERA TRACKS
WITH HIM.

BREAN AND THE CAMERA NOTICE A SMALL MINI TV IN THE GALLEY AREA, WHERE THE
STEWARDESS IS SNEAKING A PEEK AT THE SCREEN, SHOWING THE PRESIDENT, GREETING
THE GIRLSCOUT.

                          STEWARDESS
                    (CONT.)
                    (TO BREAN)
            Did you hear?

                          BREAN
            Well, I don't know, a lot of these early reports are
            inflated.

                          STEWARDESS
            ... could, could, could he have done it?

                          BREAN
            ...who understands Human Nature?

ANGLE
BACK AT HIS SEAT, THE WOMAN IN THE SEAT ACROSS THE AISLE TO HIM IS TALKING IN
AN AIRFONE.

                          WOMAN
                    (INTO PHONE)
            What did she say that the President Actually did....
            Well, who said it.  Her mother, or Her?
                    (PAUSE)
            He did...?
                    (PAUSE)
            ...and they said that on TV...?
                    (PAUSE)
            They used that word...?

BREAN EASES INTO HIS SEAT, AND TAKES OUT HIS NOTEBOOK.

                          WOMAN
                    (INTO PHONE)
            ...what time?  Two Eastern?  Alright, I'll.... Alright.

                    (SHE HANGS UP THE AIRFONE.)

BEAT.  SHE TURNS TO BREAN.  WE SEE SHE IS WEARING THE BUTTON WHICH SHOWS THE
PRESIDENT AND THE GIRLSCOUTS.  SHE LOOKS DOWN AND FINGERS THE BUTTON.

                          WOMAN
                     (OF THE BUTTON)
            ...what do you think...?

                          BREAN
            ...how can any of us know?

                          WOMAN
                    (OF THE BUTTON)
            Makes you feel kind of foolish, doesn't it...?

                          BREAN
            I'm sure that's the worst of it.
                    (BEAT)

                          WOMAN
                    (MEDITATIVELY, SHAKING HER HEAD, AS
                    SHE LOOKS AT THE BUTTON)
            ...a twelve year-old girl.
                    (PAUSE)
            ...and I was going to vote, for him.

                          BREAN
            Well, it ain't over til it's over...

AMES SITS IN THE SEAT NEXT TO BREAN.

                          BREAN
            How's he doing?

AMES SHUSHES BREAN, TAKES OUT THE AIRPHONE, AND STARTS DIALING.

THE TWO POOL ATTENDANTS STRAIGHTEN, AND PUT ON THEIR BEST SMILES, AND LOOK AT AN
ARRIVING MAN.

                          POOL ATTENDANT
            Morning, Mr. Moss.

STANLEY MOSS, A SUCCESSFUL LOOKING FELLOW AROUND SIXTY, COMES THROUGH THE
TURNSTILE, ONE OF THE ATTENDANTS BUSTLES AROUND, HANDING HIM TOWELS.  WE HOLD
ON THE SECOND ATTENDANT, WHO SCURRIES UP THE STEPS.

                          SECOND ATTENDANT
            ...I'll be right back with your juice...

MOSS CALLS AFTER HIM

                          MOSS
            ...with a carrot in it...

AS HE CLEARS THE FRAME, WE SEE, BELOW HIM, MOSS AND THE FIRST ATTENDANT, WHO
IS GESTURING DOWN TOWARD THE POOL AREA, THEY TURN THEIR HEADS.

ANGLE
DOWN AT THE DESERTED POOL AREA.  ONE NANNY TYPE, WITH A YOUNG KID IN
WATERWINGS, FROLICKING IN THE WATER, AND BREAN, AND AMES, WHO ARE SITTING IN
POOL CHAIRS.  BREAN RISES, AND WALKS TO GREET MOSS, LEAVING AMES IN THE B.G.
TALKING ON A CELL PHONE.

ANGLE
ON MOSS AND BREAN, AS MOSS APPROACHES A BIT TENTATIVELY.

                          MOSS
            Do I know you?

                          BREAN
            We have some mutual friends in Washington.

INT POOL CABANA, BEV. HILLS HOTEL, DAY.  A CURTAIN IS SWEPT ASIDE, AS MOSS
AND BREAN AND AMES ENTER, IN THE B.G. WE SEE THE NANNY AND THE LITTLE KID IN
THE POOL.  MOSS AND BREAN ARE TALKING AS THEY ENTER.

                          MOSS
            And is it true?

                          AMES
            Waal, Mr. Moss, I wouldn't....

MOSS STARTS STRIPPING OFF HIS CLOTHES, AND CHANGING INTO A SWIMSUIT.

                          MOSS
            You wouldn't be here if it wasn't true.  It's true,
            right?

HE SWITCHES ON THE TELEVISION IN THE CABANA.  WE SEE A FEMALE TALKING HEAD.

                          FEMALE TALKING HEAD
            Sexual relations with a girl thirteen years old.

THE SCREEN GOES TO THE PHOTO OF THE PRESIDENT WITH THE GIRLSCOUTS.

MOSS TURNS DOWN THE VOLUME.  AS HE AND BREAN TALK THE TV SHOWS IMAGES OF THE
PRESIDENT WITH GIRLSCOUTS, AND WITH OTHER YOUTH GROUPS.

                          MOSS
            And you're here why...?

                          BREAN
            I'm here, Mr. Moss, because you've shown yourself a
            great supporter of the Party.

                          MOSS
            Party's gonna need more than a couple bucks now.

THE POOL ATTENDANT ENTERS WITH A TRAY ON WHICH IS A GLASS WITH LIQUID AND A
CARROT STICK IN IT, AND A GLASS FULL OF CELERY STICKS.

                          MOSS
            Back where I come from they call this Romeo in Joliet.
                    (HE SHAKES HIS HEAD, REACHES ONTO A
                    SMALL TABLE BEHIND HIM, AND PICKS UP A
                    BOOK.)
            I, I, and y'know, I like the guy... he signed his
            book to me....

HE HOLDS THE BOOK TO BREAN, THE CAMERA SEES THE PHOTO OF THE PRESIDENT ON THE
BACK COVER, THE FRONT COVER READS.

            ".... FOR TWO GENERATIONS TO AGREE."

MOSS LOOKS DOWN AT THE BOOK, AND QUOTES

                          MOSS
            "For Progress to occur, it is necessary for Two
            Generations to Agree...."

HE LOOKS AT THE TELEVISION SCREEN, WHICH SHOWS THE PRESIDENT WITH A YOUNG GIBL
ON HIS LAP.

                          MOSS
            Oh, jeez, this guy is fucked.

                          BREAN
            What one has to do, Mr. Moss.  Is to fight a holding
            action.

                          MOSS
            ...holding action.  THEY'RE GOING TO TEAR THIS GUY TO
            Shreds.

                          BREAN
            If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til
            the election, we...

                          MOSS
            Yeah, hut you can't hold the dam.  How the hell,
            n'nu'n', I don't get what you want me to ...

THE SCREEN CHANGES, WE SEE THE SEAL OF THE PRESIDENT, AND WE ARE IN THE

            I don't ... they're gonna tear this guy to shreds...

            him not to fly.  He will remain, on the ground, in
            China for, they estimate, one or two days, I stress
            that, during this time he will, of...

ANGLE, ON BREAN AS HE LOOKS AT MOSS, LEANING INTO THE TV.  HE THEN
SWITCHES HIS GLANCE TOWARD THE POOL DESK, ANGLE HIS POV.  AT THE POOL DESK
WE SEE THE TWO ATTENDANTS, THE NANNY, THE KID AND SEVERAL NEWLY ARRIVED
BATHERS CLUSTERED, RAPT, AROUND THE TELEVISION.

            Would you comment on the rumors... on the rumors that
            the President's trip, that the President's delay... is
            due to the situation in Albania?

ANGLE
ON THE TELEVISION WE SEE SKLANSKY, AND SEE THAT HE IS THE CHAP IN THE
BATHROBE WHOM BREAN GAVE THE ENVELOPE TO.

            There, uh, I'm not aware of the situation to which you

            Sir:  the heads of the Albanian Desks at C.I.A., and at

A WOMAN REPORTER STANDS.

            Mr. Levy, early this morning Major General William
            Scott flew to Seattle.  Is his trip connected with the
            B-2 Bomber?

                          LEVY
            Uh...Mrs. Rose, there, to the best of my knowledge,
            there is no...

MOSS LOOKS AT BREAN APPRAISINGLY.

                          MOSS
            Have him say, 'I know we're all concerned for the
            President, there will he an update at 5:45.'

            I'm here.

ON WHICH WE SEE COMIONTATOR TALKING ABOUT A MAP OF ALBANIA.

THE SCENE SHIFTS TO THE SHOTS OF THE PRESIDENT BEING PRESIENTIAL, AND WE
HEAR, "THANK HEAVEN, FOR LITTLE GIRLS..."
AMES WINCES, WE SEE THE POOL ATTENDANTS LAUGH.

                          BREAN

ONE OF THE ATTENDANTS RAISES HIS HEAD FROM THE TV AND SPRINTS OVER TO THE

            watched the Gulf War.  What did you see?  Day after
            day, the one "Smart Bomb" falling into a building.
            The truth, I was in the building when they shot that
            shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia,
            1/10th scale model of a building.

                          MOSS
            Is that true?

            Well, we paid for it, we got the guys on a retainer.

            They got the guys on a retainer, it's cheaper, pay'em,
            but don't lettem touch it... Let'em leave us alone.

            They're torturing her family, because they have
            connections in Canada, which would permit the

THEY ARE WALKED OVER TO AN AREA IN WHICH WE FIND THE PET WRANGLER, SURROUNDED
BY SEVERAL ANIMAL CASES WITH DOGS IN THEM.
MOSS, AS HE SPEAKS, IS SURVEYING THE DOGS.

            Eh, Trudy, could I talk to you for a moment...?  You

                    (PAUSE)

HE TAKES OUT A SHEET OF PAPER FROM HIS POCKET.
THEIR WALK HAS BROUGHT THEM AND THE CAMERA BACK TO MOSS AND THE ASSISTANT, AND
THE DIRECTOR.

            think, she isn't Jewish, but she's well to-do, a nice
            old family.  Alright, yes, they say.  We would
            consider such an offer.  Wonderful, matchmaker says,

            I have a question for you.

                          MR. YOUNG
            Ask it.

                          BREAN
            Why do people go to war?

                          MR. YOUNG

            I'll play your silly game.

                          BREAN
            Why do they go to War?

                          MR. YOUNG
            To preserve their Way of Life.

                          BREAN

            Well, I have, too.  Would you do it again...?  In't
            that why you're here?  I guess so.  N'if you go to war
            again, who is it going to be against?  Your "ability to
            fight a Two-ocean War" against who?  Sweden and Togo?
            Who you sitting here to Go To War Against?  That time
            has passed.  It's passed.  It's over.  The War of the
            Future is Nuclear Terrorism.  It is and it will be
            against a Small Group of Dissidents who, unbeknownst,
            perhaps, to their own governments, have blah blah blah.
            And to go to that war, you've got to be prepared.  You
            have to be alert, and the public has to be alert.
            Cause that is the war of the future, and if you're not
            gearing up, to fight that war, eventually the axe will
            fall.  N'you're gonna be out in the street.

            your Way of Life,"  well, Chuck, this
                    (HE GESTURES AROUND THE ROOM)

            ...she's running, it's some sacred... some ancestral
            land, cloven by the Brook named.... give it to Moss,

                    (INTO THE PHONE)

            ...they just hadn't thought it through...

THE YALIE SHAKES BREAN'S HAND, AND GESTURES FOR A DOOR TO BE OPENED.  BEYOND
THE DOOR WE SEE A HELIPAD, AND THE ROTORS OF A HELICOPTER JUST BEGINNING TO
TURN, BREAN WAVES, AND TROTS OUT TO THE HELICOPTER.

            pervades, awaiting the return of...

THE AIRCREWMAN SNAPS TO ATTENTION AS BREAN COMES INTO THE AIRCRAFT, BUCKLES
HIMSELF INTO A WEBSEAT, AND FALLS ASLEEP.  HE ROUSES HIMSELF, TAKES OUT HIS
NOTEBOOK, AND STARTS TO WRITE IN IT.

EXT PARKING LOT, NASHVILLE DAWN.

A SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT, A HUGE COWBOY HAT ADORNS A STORE CALLED "KELLEY'S
WESTERN WEAR."  AT THE SUPERMARKET, SHOPPERS, PUSHING CARTS PILED HIGH -- THE
WIFE PUSHING, THE HUSBAND GUARDING THE CART WITH A RIFLE.  A FISTFIGHT BREAKS
OUT.  NO ONE NOTICES THE HELICOPTER.
BREAN IS GETTING INTO A JEEP, ITS TOP OFF, DRIVEN BY A FELLOW IN WESTERN
GETUP, ON THE SIDE IS PAINTED A GUITAR.  IN THE B.G. WE SEE THE HELICOPTER
LIFTING OFF.  IN THE JEEP ARE THE FAD KING AND MOSS.

PARKING LOT.

                          COWBOY
            It ain't hoarding.  It's stockpiling.

                          BREAN
            Uh huh.

                          COWBOY

HE HANDS IT TO MOSS.

                          MOSS
            What is it?

            hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we...

                          BREAN
            No, no, no, no, no after the airport.

THEY TURN AROUND, LOOKING FOR AMES, WHO IS HANGING BACK, LOOKING AT A TV.  THEY
RETRACE THEIR STEPS.  CAMERA TAKES THEM TO AMES, WHO IS WATCHING SENATOR NOLE
ON TV.

            ...gotten word that the situation in Albania is
            resolved.  That it is resolved.  My military sources
            confirm that our troops, along the Canadian Border, And
            overseas are standing down, and I must take this
            opportunity to call upon our President to stand and
            face the charges, the heinous charges brought against
            him.  You know, folks, there is nothing in life as
            precious as the Innocence of a Child.
                    (PAUSE)
            Nothing.  Now, I do not say these charges are true, I do
            not see how they could be.  Accusations of, of sexual
            misconduct in anyone, must be investigated.  In the
            case of a Sitting President, of one whose term, and I
            do not hesitate to mention it, ends, in, effectively,
            in a matter of days... I call upon the President...

                          AMES
            What does he mean The Situation has Been Resolved?

 (PAUSE)             You know what the worst word is, in the English
            Language?  It's ïretirement."  What the hell was I
            thinking of?  Hell, I used to...

BREAN NUDGES HIM, TO LOOK AT THE TV. 
THEY SETTLE BACK, LOOK AT THE TV. 
ANGLE, ON A TV, A COUNTRY MUSIC SPECTACULAR. WILLIE NELSON IS CALLED TO THE STAGE, SITS ON HIS STOOL, PLAYS A FEW BARS FOR NOTHING, AND THEN A RENDITION OF "COURAGE, MOM."

ANGLE, IN THE AUDIENCE, PAN OVER THE FACES, ONE TEENAGE GIRL IN A 858 SWEATSHIRT, BEARING THE LOGO, AND THE WORD, "VOLO," IS SILENTLY, TEARFULLY, MOUTHING THE WORDS ALONG WITH WILLIE. 
 WILLIE NELSON             "What have you got at the end of the day?  How do you
            keep those fears at bay?  What do you say, when there's
            nothin' to say?  Courage, Mom..."
 (ET CETERA) 
ANGLE MOSS AND BREAN. 
 BREAN             We pick up Schumann.  Sneak him back inside the Beltway.
            And we plan his homecoming.  Zt's gone be Neil
            Armstrong, Dr. Livingston, and Lindy...They're gonna
            forget, they're gonna forget, they're gonna forget that
            there is an election...The Pres's gonna have to say,
            one of his speeches, "Don't forget to Vote..."

 MOSS             I got it in the inaugural.  "Thank you for voting for
            me, but, as importantly:  Thank you for voting...
 (HE GESTUR£S AT A SHEAF OF PAPERS) 
 BREAN (GRINS)             Getting off on the inaugural?
 (MOSS NODS)             Gonna go...

 MOSS             Might, if I was asked...
 (HE SMILES) 
ANGLE THE OKLAHOMA AIRPORT. NIGHT. 
IN THE POURING RAIN, THE PLANE, BEING WAVED TO A PARKING SPACE. IN THE B.G. AN ARMY TRUCK, SURROUNDED BY CHASE CARS, PULLS UP, WE READ, "UNITED STATES ARMY. SPECIAL P..." AND THE REST OF THE WORD OBSCURED. 
ANGLE INT THE PLANE. AS THE TWO UNBUCKLE, AND STRETCH. 
 MOSS             But, you know, this is the meeting, Ron?  You think
            about it.  This is the meeting.  This, here.  Schumann
            and us.  King Kong and the Trainers...this's it... What
            are you working on?

ANGLE ON BREAN, WHO IS DOODLING. 
 BREAN             Medal.  Medal and Ribbon.

 MOSS             Of what?

 BREAN             The Albanian Campaign.

 MOSS (TO HIMSELF)             ...the Albanian Campaign.  This... this is history...

AMES COMES UP FROM THE BACK OF THE PLANE. 
 AMES             ...The Albanian Campaign...

 MOSS             ...like the sound of it, eh...

 AMES             We've got to put that, into the Inaugural.  "I have
            here, a ribbon.  You haven't seen it before, and you
            will not see it too often now.  For it is the Proud
            Possession of a few, a very few Men and Women... it is
            the Ribbon of the Albanian Campaign...."

THE OTHER TWO LOOK AT HIM ADMIRINGLY. 
 MOSS             Wilfred, that's not bad.

 BREAN             That's not bad at all.

 AMES             Well, you know, "The Whole Thing's Theatre..."

THE OTHER TWO MEN LAUGH WITH HIM. 
 BREAN             Napoleon said, fellow won't sell you his life, but he
            will trade it to you for a little piece of ribbon.

 MOSS             ...the Albanian Campaign.
 (PAUSE)             And we won't even be a footnote...

 BREAN             We were the Albanian campaign, John -- We Were There.

HE CLEARS HIS THROAT. HE LOOKS OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW. WE SEE A MILITARY CONVOY APPROACHING. THE DOOR TO THE COCKPIT OPENS, THE PILOT GOES OUT. 
 PILOT             Gentlemen, little problematical weather.

 BREAN             Well, c'n we get him back home?

 PILOT             Could if we had to.  Rather not.  Rough weather.

BREAN AND MOSS GET UP, MOVE TOWARD THE FRONT OF THE PLANE, MOSS LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW. 
 MOSS             Well, they're protecting him well enough.

 BREAN             They should be.  Most valuable animal since Sea
            Biscuit.  Isn't he...

 MOSS             Bigger than that.  For want of a nail a Kingdom was
            lost...

 BREAN             You've got something, there...

 AMES (WRITING)             Napoleon said -- A man will not sell you his
            life...

THEY LOOK OUT THE WINDOW, START STRAIGHTENING UP THEIR CLOTHING, ET CETERA, IN PREPARATION FOR MEETING SCHUMANN. BREAN LOOKS HACK OVER HIS SHOULDER AT THE TELEVISION. 
ANGLE HIS POV. ON THE TV A PICTURE HEADED "ANDREWS AIRFORCE BASE," AND SIGNS OF SCAFFOLDING BEING CONSTRUCTED, AND BUNTING PUT UP. CUTS TO A TALKING HEAD, IN FRONT OF A PHOTO OF SCHUMANN. 
ANGLE MOSS AND BREAN. 
 BREAN             ...a masterpiece...

 MOSS (SHRUGS)             ...givem what they want...But...

THEY MOVE TOWARD THE FRONT OF THE PLANE. THEY RUN INTO THE PILOT. 
 PILOT             Weather's worsening, sir...might be advisable, wait it
            out, on the ground, till..

 BREAN (NODS)             We're due at Andrews.
 (LOOKS AT HIS WATCH) 
 PILOT             Well, I wouldn't go up in it, lest I had to...

 MOSS (TO AMES)             Here he comes...

THEY HEAR THE PLANE DOOR OPENING. THEY ALL STRAIGHTEN UP AND SMILE, AS SCHUMANN, A RAINCOAT OVER HIS SHOULDERS, IS LED ONTO THE PLANE, FLANKED BY 4 M.P.'S, AND AN OFFICER, WITH A CLIPBOARD. 
 MOSS             Sergeant Schumann?  If I may?  Welcome to History...

 AMES             Sergeant Schumann?  My name is Ames.  Welcome.

 OFFICER             S'mby named Brean?  Sign here...

 BREAN (TO THE PILOT)             Captain...  You wanna Take'er up...?

 PILOT             Heavy weather East of here.

 BREAN             Whaddaya think?

 PILOT             Six to five and pick'em...you wanna chance it...

THEY ARE QUIET, AS SOUNDS OF THE TV FILTER IN. AN EXCITED NEWSCASTER. 
 NEWSCASTER (ON TV)             Word that William Schumann, the Old Shoe, is
            expected back, today, and that a glimpse of him...

 MOSS             Let's fly, if it'll fly... People waiting for us...

THE PHONE RINGS. BREAN ANSWERS IT. 
 BREAN (ON PHONE. HE HAS NOT YET REGISTERED SCHUMANN)             ...child at the airport...
 (TO MOSS)             breaks through the ranks, runs to "old shoe" --
            should we have flower or a bear...?

 AMES             Uh...Didn't we do this?

 BREAN             Never quit a winner.

 MOSS             I thought they weren't meeting him at the airport...

 BREAN             They insist they wanna go with meeting him at the
            airport.  I told'em they're wrong, I can't convince'em.
            They're concerned that the last kid had the Wheat.
            Variations include, the kid is a boy, the kid is twins,
            it's a little dog ... they rub meat on Schumann's cuff,
            the dog runs to him...

 MOSS (OF SCHUMANN)             Uh...

IN THE B.G. BREAN FINISHES SIGNING THE CLIPBOARD, THE OFFICER NODS TO THE M.P.'S, AND THEY SALUTE AND DEPART, THE OFFICER HANDS A KEY TO BREAN. 
 AMES (OF KEY)             What's this...?

THE OFFICER TAKES THE RAINCOAT FROM SCHUMANN'S SHOULDERS, REVEALING HE IS IN A PRISON UNIFORM, AND HEAVILY MANACLED. THE MAN, IS SCHUMANN, AN UNMISTAKABLE DERANGED, DROOLING, PSYCHO-NUTTER. HOLD. 
 OFFICER (TAKES A KEY ON A CHAIN FROM AROUND HIS NECK -- HANDS IT TO BREAN)             Key to the manacles...

THE OFFICER SALUTES, STARTS OUT OF THE PLANE. 
ANGLE. AMES LOOKS BACK, AT THE MANACLED SCHUMANN, AND BREAN GLARING, OPEN MOUTHED AT HIM. 
ANGLE EXT THE PLANE, THE OFFICER RETREATING, IN THE RAIN, TO THE TRUCK, AMES, RUNNING AFTER HIM. 
 AMES             Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait...
 (HE CATCHES UP WITH THE OFFICER)             What did he...what...what's the trouble?

 OFFICER             No trouble at all.

 AMES             What did he do...?

THE OFFICER CONSULTS HIS CLIPBOARD. CAMERA PANS TO SHOW THE VAN READS "MILITARY SPECIAL PRISONS." 
ANGLE INT, THE PLANE, BREAN, LOOKING AT SCHUMANN. HOLD. MOSS ENTERS THE PLANE. 
ANGLE ON MOSS, AS HE MOVES TO HIS BRIEFCASE, AND EXTRACTS THE TELEPHONE-LIKE BOOK, HE TURNS TO THE FRONT PAGE, AND WE SEE THE TITLE IS "MILITARY SPECIAL PRISONS." 
ANGLE MOSS AND BREAN. MOSS HANDS BREAN THE BOOK. BREAN LOOKS. TURNS TO MOSS. AND THEN TO SCHUMANN. 
 BREAN             ...how ya doing?

MOSS TAKES THE CLIPBOARD, AND READS, WHILE AMES SITS STUNNED. 
 SCHUMANN             Fine.

MOSS HOLDS UP THE MILITARY DIRECTORY.

 MOSS             I think we asked for "special programs" and they gave
            us "special prisons."

 BREAN             Yeah, well -- it's only one word difference.

AMES DRAWS MOSS ASIDE. 
 AMES (SOTTO)             He, uh, has he been in the "jail" long?

 MOSS             ...twelve years.

BREAN NODS. 
 AMES             Much more...uh, he have much more time to "serve?"

MDSS SHAKES HIS HEAD, SPREADS HIS HANDS APART TO ARM'S LENGTH. PAUSE AMES (BRAVING IT)             What'd he do?

 MOSS             He raped a nun.
 (PAUSE) 
 AMES             Yeeaahhh...  Ohmigod ... ohmigod... ohmigod...

 MOSS (READING FROM THE CLIPBOARD)             ...and...

 AMES             And?  NO.  I don't wanna know.
 (PAUSE)             What do you mean "and..."?

 MOSS (READING)             Look, look, look....
 (HE HOLDS UP A SMALL VIAL, READS.)             He's fine, as long as he has his medication.

 AMES             What happens if he doesn't have his medication?

 MOSS             He's not fine.

BREAN GOES TO THE FRONT OF THE PLANE. 
 BREAN             Yeah, Captain, uh, yeah, Captain, uh, y'better get us
            back to Washington.

BREAN POURS HIMSELF A DRINK. PAUSE. TO SCHUMANN. 
 BREAN             How are'ya...

DISSOLVE 
INT THE PLANE NIGHT. 
INSERT. THE VIAL OF PILLS, LABELLED, "MILITARY SPECIAL PRISONS," SCHUMANN, WILLIAM. A. TWO PILLS EVERY FOUR HOURS. SHOULD THE PATIENT BECOME VIOLENT THE DOSAGE CAN BE INCREASED TO... THE PILLS SPILL OUT OF THE FRAME. 
ANGLE THE PLANE, IN A VIOLENT RAINSTORM, BUCKING WILDLY. AMES, ON HIS KNEES, GATHERING UP THE PILLS, REPLACES THEM IN THE VIAL, SHAKES OUT TWO, AND GIVES THEM TO SCHUMANN. WHO TAKES THEM. MOSS THEN STRAPS HIMSELF BACK IN AND BREAN CONTINUES TALKING ON THE TELEPHONE. 
THE THREE STRAPPED IN, THE PLANE TOSSING WILDLY. BREAN ON THE PHONE. 
 SCHUMANN             You gonna git me back tomorrow?
 (PAUSE)             Cause they havin beans tomorrow...

 BREAN (ON THE PHONE) (HE PICKS UP A BOTTLE OF SCOTCH AND STARTS DRINKING FROM IT.)             A slight, a slight, well, no, we're gonna deal with it,
            we just, I need a little readjustment...we need to
            rethink...

 MOSS             Yes, William, Uh, we have this thing we're doing...

 SCHUMANN             Long's you git me back for the beans...

 MOSS             ...for the beans, yes...

 BREAN (ON THE PHONE)             We're gonna, just, may have to call off the...

HE GESTURES AT THE SILENT TELEVISION, WHERE WE SEE THE SIGNS OF THE SCAFFOLDING, SIGNS READING, "WELCOME HOME OLD SHOE," ET CETERA...
            Well, maybe, you know, ah, ah, he's sicker than we
            thought, and rush him under wraps to Walter Reed to do
            a complete...

 SCHUMANN (TO AMES)             R'if y'r gonna keep me out, I'd kinda like the chance,
            t'go to church...
 (HE LEANS TOWARD AMES AND WINKS LASCIVIOUSLY, AND NUDGES HIM IN THE RIBS) 
 AMES             Oh Lord.  What have you done to me?  What have you done
            to me...?

 BREAN             Wilfred.

 AMES             ...what have you done to me...

 BREAN             All Combat takes place at night, in the Rain, and at
            the Junction of four Map Segments...

 AMES             ...what are we going to do...?

 MOSS             He's fine, as long as he gets his medication.

 BREAN             Speaking of that...
 (HE LOOKS AT THE VIAL)             We're gonna need a whole lot more of this....

 AMES             Well, get on the phone, and get it...

 MOSS             You know, I think you people are looking at this All
            Wrong.  If you look at the backstory -- the guy's
            coming back from Combat and Torture.  Of course he is
            gonna be ... uh ... uh ... "fucked up".  Of Course he's
            gonna "need a little help"...
 (GESTURES PUTTING A HYPODERMIC IN HIS ARM) 
 AMES (TO HIMSELF)             Oh, Lord....

ANGLE, ON THE TV, WHERE WE SEE THE PRESIDENT, WEARING AN OLD SHOE BUTTON.

 PRESIDENT             ...a proclamation of a Day of National Rejoining...

THE TELEVISICN GOES ALL FUZZY, THEN CONKS OUT.             ...a day of Humility, a day of Pride...in the Return
            of...

 SCHUMANN             N'ybody gotta Beer...?

THE LIGHTS IN THE PLANE FLICKER, AND THEN COME ON, WE SEE THE LIGHTENING FLASHING OUT OF THE WINDOW, THE CO-PILOT COMES BACK INTO THE CABIN... 
 BREAN (ON THE PHONE)             Just....do what I ...look:  get me a ...hello...?
            Hel...?  I'm going to need an ambulance, we take him,

            Somebody in a Hospital gown.  And we need a
            ......hello?  Hello...?

THE LINE GOES DEAD. 
 BREAN             Cause I don't think this dog is gonna hunt....

 MOSS             He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?

 BREAN             Yeah, well, perhaps...
 (TO PHONE)             Speaking of which:  I have a prescription here, I'm
            going to give you the number, I need you standing by
            with a crate of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?

 MOSS             An anti-psychotic...

 BREAN (TO TELEPHONE)             It's an anti-psychotic, the num...  the
            number...hello...hello...

BEAT. THE BUFFETING STOPS. THE CO-PILOT ENTERS. 
 CO-PILOT             We have been experiencing some buffeting, but I think
            from here on out, it's going to be fine.

HE RETURNS TO THE COCKPIT. BREAN TRIES TO REDIAL THE TELEPHONE. 
 SCHUMANN             Long's I git back for my Beans.

 MOSS             This is nothing,  Wait'll you've worked with a movie
            star, one time, this is nothing, we keep him shot-up
            and happy -- the Old Days, I used to think I was a
            pharmacist, the kind of stuff I had to do.  One time...

 SCHUMANN             Cause the beans, y'know, y'can tell if they're puttin
            stuff in it.

 BREAN             Uh huh...

 SCHUMANN             So you don't have to fear it.

 BREAN             Uh huh...

 MOSS             Mmm.

 BREAN             What kind of stuff?
 (TO PHONE)             Hello...?

 SCHUMANN (PAUSE. SCHUMANN LOOKS AT THEM WARILY)             What do you mean, "What kind of stuff?"

 AMES             No, no, he didn't mean anything at all...

 BREAN (TO MOSS)             Give'em another pill...

 AMES             No.  No.  He didn't mean anything by it at all...

 BREAN (TO PHONE)             Hello?   No, operator...

MOSS ADMINISTERS A PILL TO SCHUMANN. 
 SCHUMANN             What the fuck did you mean, "What kind of stuff?"?

 MOSS (TO BREAN)             ...this is nothing.  This is nothing. D'you ever shoot
            in Italy?  Try three Italian starlets on Benzedrine,
            this is a walk in the park...

 SCHUMANN (AS IF COMING TO)             ...who are you?
 (PAUSE)             Who are you sonofabitches...
 (HE LOOKS AROUND WILDLY) 
 AMES             We're just, actually, we're friends of... can we get
            another pill into him...

 SCHUMANN             Where are you taking me...?

 BREAN (TO PHONE)             Hello...?

A HUGE FLASH OF LIGHTENING, THE PLANE IS PLUNGED INTO DARKNESS, THE ENGINES STOP: 
INT THE DARK CABIN. THE WIND WHISTLING. 
 AMES (SOFTLY)             Oh, Heck.

DISSOLVE 
EXT A FIELD IN MONTANA. THE WRECKED CORPORATE JET. 
ANGLE A BEATEN-UP BREAN STRUGGLES FROM THE PLANE, FINISHING A BOTTLE OF SCOTCH, HE FLINGS IT FROM HIM, REACHES IN HIS BACK POCKET, OPENS ANOTHER, AND, AS HE DOES SO, HE SINGS DRUNKENLY. 
 BREAN             "Hush little baby, don't say a Word...Pappa's gonna buy
            you a Mockingbird, if that Mocking bird don't sing,
            Poppa's gonna buy you a diamond ring..."

AMES, SIMILARLY BRUISED, STUMBLES FROM THE PLANE BEHIND HIM. 
 BREAN             ...kid complains, kid cries, gets more junk, junk don't
            work, kid cries, gets more junk.  End of the song,
            house full of worthless junk, the kid's still crying.
            Story of America...
 (HE SITS ON THE GROUND AND OPENS THE NEW BOTTLE OF SCOTCH.)             ...Z'at ever bother you...?
 (HE REACHES BACK INTO THE PLANE, AND BRINGS OUT A SMALL TELEVISION SET) 
ANGLE, AS HE LEANS INTO THE PLANE. WE SEE MOSS, LYING IN A HEAP, MOSS COMES TO. 
 MOSS             ...what happened...?

 BREAN             I think we were experiencing a Little Technical
            Difficulty.

 MOSS             How's our friend?

BREAN SETS UP THE TELEVISION. TURNS IT ON. HE SITS, AND TAKES THE BOTTLE FROM BREAN, AND DRINKS. 
 MOSS             ..."Courage.  Mom"...

BREAN HAS KICKED THE TELEVISION INTO LIFE, WE SEE A MAN AND WOMAN ANCHOR, SPEAKING LUGUBRIOUSLY, INTO THE CAMERA. 
 BREAN             News.  Like a Wedding Cake.  Tons and tons of sticky
            sugar, Barbie and Ken on top...
 (HE HITS THE TV)             Can't ya Talk, you sonofabitches...?

 MOSS             What the hell do we care?

 BREAN             Eh?  I'm like the Rest of America.  I don't care -- I'm
            just addicted to it...

A PHOTO OF SCHUMANN COMES ON THE TELEVISION. BREAN STUMBLES BACK INTO THE PLANE, AND HAULS THE DAZED SCHUMANN OUT, AND PROPS HIM AGAINST THE PLANE. 
 BREAN (TO SCHUMANN)             N'just when everything was going so well...

HE SIGHS. HE LOOKS AT THE TELEVISION SCREEN. 
ANGLE THE CROWDS AT ANDREW'S AIRKORCE BASE, THE "OLD SHOE" BANNERS, THE "COURAGE, MOM," BANNERS. THE STILL BAND. A SHOT OF THE BANDMASTER, SURREPTITIOUSLY, GLANCING AT HIS WATCH. 
 MOSS             How's our friend?  What is he, "dead?"

 BREAN             Wake up.

 MOSS             Is he dead?

 AMES             Is he dead?
 (PAUSE)             Is he dead?  ARE YOU DEAD?  WAKE UP.  You stupid, nun-
            raping sonofoabitch.... wake up...  WAKE UP.  Do you
            want to spend the rest of your life in JAIL?  WAKE UP!
            Do You Know Who I AM???  I'm talking to you...

SCHUMANN BEGINS TO ROUSE BIMSELF. 
 SCHUMANN             Z'it time for Exercise?
 (PAUSE)             Cause it's my Day on the Yard.

 BREAN             Courage, Mom.

 MOSS (PAUSE)             This is nothing. ...piece of cake.  Y'know, producing
            is being a Samurai Warrior.  They pay you, day in, day
            out, for Years, so that, ONE DAY, when called upon,
            you can respond, your training At Its Peak, and save
            the day.

ANGLE BREAN, SHAKING HIS HEAD. IN THE B.G., MOSS, DRINKING. THE TV COMES TO LIFE. 
 COMMENTATOR             ...long overdue, its absence unexplained.

THE NEXT SHOT IS SENATOR BUD NOLE, SPEAKING EARNESTLY AT THE CAMERA. 
 NOLE             ...this...regrettable absence... this ...tardy absence
            of the flight.  Must give us pause.  And, in that pause
            we should take time to examine ourselves, our plans,
            and our future.  There has been an ...interregnum -- if
            you will, of reason, while we've watched unfold this
            drama..... on the world scale...

 AMES (TO HIMSELF)             ...I hate this cocksucker...

 NOLE             And, now, end how it will, this drama is done...

ANGLE MOSS, AS HE WANDERS BACK TO STARE AT THE SCREEN. THE VAST FIELDS STRETCHING AWAY IN THE DISTANCE 
 NOLE (C)             The drama is done, and we must pause to consider.
 (HE HOLDS UP A PHOTO OF THE PRESIDENT)             And we must consider this man.  This man...who, you
            will remember, was discovered, scant days ago, in a
            situation which must debar him from Public Office...
 (HE HOLDS UP A SHOT OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE GIRLSCOUTS)             And I say, when we take time to reflect, there're going
            to be a lot of apartments for rent in Washington,
            Election Day.  Two days from now, Folks...Don't forget
            to vote.

 MOSS             No, I didn't think so.

AMES KICKS IN THE THLEVISION. HE MOVES TO SCHUMANN AND LIFTS HIM TO HIS FEET. 
 BREAN (DRUNKENLY)             Leav't alone.  Wha'd television ever do to you?  Ate
            your life, ruin'd your Culture, but...

AMES FINISHES DESTROYING THE TV. 
 AMES             IT DESTROYED THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.        

HE FINISHES RAGING AT THE TELEVISION SET. PAUSE. 
 MOSS             Come on.

 AMES             ...where?

 MOSS             Come on.

MOSS MOVES SCHUMANN INTO A STANDING POSITION.

 BREAN             Uh huh...why?

 MOSS             We're going home.  We're going home together...

 BREAN             We have no home.  We're vagrants.  N'each man's hand's
            against us.  We killed Old Shoe...

MOSS STARTS CODDLING SCHUMANN. 
 MOSS             Come on, Pal, come on Willie, come on, Old Shoe...

 SCHUMANN             Just want to take a nap.

 MOSS             He's not dead, Ronnie.  He's just a little
            understandab1y, fatigued.
 (PAUSE)             Let's get him to some help...

 SCHUMANN             ...gimme some help...

 MOSS             That's right, we'll take a nap.  We'll get you to
            Washington, we'll get you Back to your Buddies, and...

 SCHUMANN             ...just want to Get Back to the Beans...

MOSS WALKS TO BREAN, AND STARTS KICKING HIM. 
 MOSS             Come on, you fucking sissy, you think this is tough?
            Try show-business.  1970-1990, n'ybody I worked with,

 BREAN             I'm tired.

 MOSS             Finish Strong!  Are you nuts?
 (HE STARTS SHEPHERDING THE TWO ACROSS THE VAST WHEATFIELD)             Are you nuts?  This's Pennies from Heaven... on his
            triumphal return home, Old Shoe, his Plane Forced
            Down...AND YET...

 BREAN             He's supposed to be flying in from Europe.

 MOSS             We'll deal with that when we come to it.  This is

 AMES             ...his Triumphal Plane.  Shot Down.

            pay'em.  What did he do?  What did he do?  Printed up

 MOSS             Why not?

 BREAN             Some'b'y'll have you killed.

 BREAN             And what the fuck story are you gonna tell?  The guy is
            a nutcase.

 MOSS             You would be, two, if you'd gone through what he went
            through.

 BREAN             He raped a Nun...

 BREAN             He's doped to the Gills ...

 AMES             ...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.

 MOSS             Fuck the world.  Try a ten A.M. pitch meeting, no
            sleep, coked-to-the-gills, and you haven't even read
            the material.

 AMES             But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?

 MOSS             How do we explain that?  Ah, well, you see, Wilfred,
            this is where you've never been at a pitch.  You see?
            His records say he was in prison ... as they must, as
            all the records of Group 303 have the men and the
            women, carried on their roster, as belonging somewhere

 JOYCE             What would be true, then.

 SECOND MEDIA GUY             Well, you  said it yourself, earlier, and if I may
            rephrase, that the success of the President, in the
            Polls...

 JOYCE             ...as of today, 89% favorable.

 SECOND MEDIA GUY             Eighty-nine percent favorable, is based not on

 MOSS             Prouder of this, than anything I ever did in my life.
            I want to thank you, Ron.
 (PAUSE)             Want to thank you.

THE SCREEN COMES BACK TO THE TALKING HEADS. WKERE WE SEE THE COMMENTATORS INTERVIEWING THE SUBJECTS. 
 JOYCE             And as we said.  The President, a sure-fire winner, and
            the campaign, many said, that put him there...

THE SCREEN CHANGES TO TWO HORSES IN A PADDOCK. A COUPLE OF JOCKEYS WALK UP TO THEM. 
 JOCKEY ONE             Which horse you going to ride tomorrow, Jim?

 JOCKEY TWO             Well, Chuck, my Daddy used to say, and I've lived by
            it:  never change Horses in...

 MOSS (TO HIMSELF)             ...oh no...

THE SCREEN REVERTS TO THE MODERATOR AND THE TWO TYPES. 
 JOYCE             And now, we're going to be taking your calls.  The
            number is...

MOSS RISES. MOSS BEGINS PACING AROUND THE READYROOM. 
 BREAN             What're you doing?

 MOSS             I'm looking for a phone...

 BREAN             No, I don't think you can do that.

 MOSS             Watch me.

 BREAN             No, I don't think you can do that, Stanley...

 MOSS             Watch me.

 BREAN             Stanley.  Stanley... you knew the... Stanley.
 (HE RESTRAINS HIM)             You knew the deal when you signed on.

 MOSS             Deal's changed.

 BREAN             No, the deal isn't changed.  The Deal isn't changed.
            You can't ... what is it?  Money?  Money?  You want
            Money?

 MOSS             Money?  You think I did this for money...?  I did this
            for Credit.  Credit, paalll...

 BREAN             But you always knew you couldn't take the credit....

 MOSS             That's one thing, but I'm not gonna let two dickheads
            from Filmschool take it... are you Nuts?  Are you Nuts?

HE TRIES TO GET OUT OF THE READYROOM. BREAN RESTRAINS HIM. 
ANGLE TIGHT ON THE TWO. 
 BREAN             Stanley, no fooling... no fooling... you're playing
            with your life here...

 MOSS             Fuck my life... Fuck my life.... Z WANT THE CREDIT...
            The Credit.  Do you know what the New York Times said
            about my last picture?  They pissed on me.  They pissed
            on me.  Do you know what that picture Grossed?  And now
            some limp-dick film school pansy...

 JOYCE (ON TV)             That number to call....

MOSS TAKES OUT A PAD AND PENCIL, AND BEGINS TO WRITE IT DOWN. 
 BREAN             Stanley, you can't do this....

AMES CALLS FROM THE FAR ROOM. 
 AMES             Could we have you in here, please...7

                          Andrew Stanton & Pete Docter





          EXT. SPACE
          
          FADE IN:
          
          Stars.
          The upbeat show tune, Put On Your Sunday Clothes, plays.
          
          "Out there, there's a world outside of Yonkers..."
          
          More stars.
          Distant galaxies, constellations, nebulas...
          A single planet.
          Drab and brown.
          Moving towards it.
          Pushing through its polluted atmosphere.
          
          "...Close your eyes and see it glisten..."
          
          
          EXT. PLANET'S SURFACE - CONTINUOUS
          
          A range of mountains takes form in the haze.
          Moving closer.
          The mountains are piles of TRASH.
          The entire surface is nothing but waste.
          
          "...We're gonna find adventure in the evening air..."
          
          A silhouetted city in the distance.
          What looks like skyscrapers turns into trash.
          Thousands of neatly stacked CUBES OF TRASH, stories high.
          Rows and rows of stacked cubes, like city avenues.
          They go on for miles.
          
          
          EXT. AVENUE OF TRASH
          
          "...Beneath your parasol the world is all a smile..."
          
          Something moving on the ground far below.
          A figure at the foot of a trash heap.
          A SMALL SERVICE ROBOT diligently cubing trash.
          Rusted, ancient.
          Cute.
          Every inch of him engineered for trash compacting.
          
          Mini-shovel hands collect junk.
          Scoop it into his open chassis.
          His front plate closes slowly, compressing waste.
          A faded label on his corroded chest plate:
          "Waste Allocation Loader - Earth Class" (WALL-E)
          
          Wall-E spits out a cube of trash.
          Stacks it with the others.
          
                                                                      2.
          
          
          Something catches his eye.
          Tugs on a piece of metal stuck in the stack.
          A hubcap.
          The sun reflects off it.
          Wall-E checks the sky.
          
          ON TRASH HEAP HORIZON
          
          The sun sets through the smoggy haze.
          
          "...And we won't come back until we've kissed a girl --"
          
          He places the hubcap in his compactor.
          Presses a button on his chest.
          The song stops playing.
          The end of a work day.
          
          Wall-E attaches a lunch cooler to his back.
          Whistles for his pet COCKROACH.
          The insect hops on his shoulder.
          They motor down from the top of a GIANT TRASH TOWER.
          
          
          EXT. AVENUES OF TRASH - DUSK
          
          Wall-E travels alone.
          Traverses miles of desolate waste.
          Oblivious to roving storms of toxic weather.
          
          Passes haunting structures buried within the trash.
          Buildings, highways, entire cities...
          Everything branded with the SAME COMPANY LOGO.
          "Buy N Large"
          "BNL" stores, restaurants, banks...transportation!
          The corporation ran every aspect of life.
          There's even a BNL LOGO on Wall-E's chest plate.
          
          CLOSE ON NEWSPAPER Wall-E drives over.
          Headline: "TOO MUCH TRASH!! Earth Covered!!"
          The deck: "BNL CEO Declares Global Emergency!"
          A photo of the BNL CEO giving a weak smile.
          
          Wall-E's old treads are threadbare.
          Practically falling apart.
          Cause a bumpy ride for his cockroach.
          He passes the remains of other RUSTED WALL-E UNITS.
          Fancies one with NEWER TREADS than his own...
          
          
          EXT. DESERTED STREET - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Wall-E now sports the newer treads.
          Rolls past a SERIES OF HOLOGRAPHIC BILLBOARDS.
          The solar-powered ads still activate when he passes them.
          
                                                                      3.
          
          
          
                                     BILLBOARD ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                               (Ad #1: BNL logo over trash)
                        Too much garbage in your face?
                               (Ad #2: starliner in space)
                        There's plenty of space out in space!
                               (Ad #3: starliners take off
                                from Earth)
                        BNL starliners leaving each day.
                               (Ad #4: WALL-E units wave
                                goodbye)
                        We'll clean up the mess while you're
                        away.
          
          
          EXT. EDGE OF THE CITY
          
          Wall-E drives down a deserted overpass.
          Activates an even LARGER HOLOGRAPHIC BILLBOARD.
          
          CLOSE ON BILLBOARD AD
          
          Shows off a CITY-SIZED LUXURY STARLINER.
          Depicts passengers enjoying all its amenities.
          
                                     BILLBOARD ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        The jewel of the BNL fleet: "The Axiom".
                        Spend your five year cruise in style.
                        Waited on 24 hours a day by our fully
                        automated crew, while your Captain and
                        Autopilot chart a course for non-stop
                        entertainment, fine dining. And with our
                        all-access hover chairs, even Grandma can
                        join the fun! There's no need to walk!
                        "The Axiom". Putting the "star" in
                        Executive Starliner.
          
          The BNL CEO appears at the end.
          Waves goodbye as the Axiom takes off.
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                        Because, at BNL, space is the final "fun"-
                        tier.
          
          The holographic billboard powers off.
          Reveals the AXIOM'S DESERTED LAUNCHPAD in the distance.
          The mammoth structure sits across the bay.
          Now empty and dry. A polluted, dead valley.
          
          ON COLLAPSED BRIDGE RAMP
          
          Near its edge rests a WALL-E UNIT TRANSPORT TRUCK.
          A giant child's Tonka Truck left to weather the elements.
          A "Buy N Large" logo on its side.
          Wall-E approaches the rear of the truck.
          
                                                                     4.
          
          
          Pulls on a lever.
          The back lowers.
          Wall-E motors up the ramp.
          
          
          INT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS
          
          Open racks for storing WALL-Es line both walls.
          KNICKKNACKS OF FOUND JUNK littered everywhere.
          The tired robot removes his newfound treads.
          Ahh... Home.
          
          Wall-E motors down the center aisle.
          Flicks on an ancient BETAMAX PLAYER.
          Jury-rigged to an iPod.
          Pushes in a cassette labeled, "Hello Dolly!"
          The image is very poor quality.
          Actors sing and dance to Put On Your Sunday Clothes (POYSC).
          The same song Wall-E worked to.
          
                                        WALL-E
                         [Hums POYSC]
          
          Wall-E opens his cooler.
          Newfound knickknacks.
          Pulls out the hubcap from his chest.
          Looks back at the TV.
          Mimics the dancers on the screen.
          Pretends the hubcap is a hat.
          
          Continues to unpack:
          A spork.
          A Rubik's Cube (unsolved).
          A Zippo Lighter.
          
          He presses a BUTTON by the rack of shelves.
          They rotate until an empty space appears.
          His new items are lovingly added to the shelf.
          The Zippo joins a pre-existing LIGHTER COLLECTION.
          
          A new song, It Only Takes A Moment, plays on the video.
          Wall-E is drawn to it.
          Presses his "Record" button.
          
          ON TV SCREEN
          
          Two lovers sing gently to one another.
          They kiss...hold hands...
          
          Wall-E tilts his head as he watches.
          Curious.
          Holds his own hands.
          
                                                                    5.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. TRUCK - NIGHT
          
          Wall-E motors outside.
          Turns over his Igloo cooler to clean it out.
          Pauses to take in the night sky.
          STARS struggle to be seen through the polluted haze.
          Wall-E presses the "Play" button on his chest.
          The newly sampled It Only Takes A Moment (IOTAM) plays.
          
          The wind picks up.
          A WARNING LIGHT sounds on Wall-E's chest.
          He looks out into the night.
          A RAGING SANDSTORM approaches off the bay...
          
          Unfazed, Wall-E heads back in the truck.
          IOTAM still gently playing.
          
          ...The massive wave of sand roars closer...
          
          Wall-E raises the door.
          Pauses.
          WHISTLES for his cockroach to come inside.
          The door shuts just as the storm hits.
          Obliterates everything in view.
          
          
          INT. TRUCK - SAME
          
          Wall-E alone in the center of his shelter.
          Unwraps a BNL SPONGECAKE (think Twinkie).
          Lays it out for the cockroach to sleep in.
          It happily dives in.
          
          Wall-E collapses himself into a storable cube.
          Backs into an empty shelf space.
          Rocks it like a cradle...
          ...and shuts down for the night.
          Outside the wind howls like the Hounds of Hell.
          
          
          INT. WALL-E'S TRUCK - NEXT MORNING
          
          Wall-E's CHARGE METER flashes "WARNING".
          He wakes. Unboxes.
          Groggy and lifeless.
          Stumbles outside.
          
          
          EXT. ROOF OF WALL-E'S TRUCK
          
          The morning sun.
          Wall-E fully exposed in its light.
          His front panel splayed out like a tanning shield.
          A solar collector.
          
                                                                  6.
          
          
          
          His CHARGE METER chimes full.
          Solar panels fold away into hiding.
          Wall-E, now awake, collects his lunch cooler.
          Heads off to work.
          ...and accidentally runs over the cockroach.
          Horrified, Wall-E reverses.
          
          Reveals the FLATTENED INSECT under his tread.
          The cockroach simply pops back to life.
          No biggie. Ready to go.
          Relieved, Wall-E resumes their commute.
          
          
          EXT. WALL-E'S WORK SITE - THAT MORNING
          
          A SERIES OF "WALL-E AT WORK" MOMENTS:
          
          - CU of Wall-E's hands digging into garbage.
            CU of trash being scooped into his chest compactor.
            A cube lands by the cockroach.
          
          - Wall-E discovers a BRA in the garbage.
            Unsure what it's for.
            Tries placing it over his eyes, like glasses.
            Tosses it in his cooler.
          
          - Wall-E finds a set of CAR KEYS.
            Presses the remote lock.
            Somewhere in the distance a CAR ALARM CHIRPS.
          
          - Plays with a paddle ball.
            The ball keeps smacking him in the face.
            He doesn't like it.
          
          - Wall-E discovers a DIAMOND RING in a JEWEL CASE.
            Throws out the ring. Keeps the case.
            The jewel case drops into the cooler, then...
            ...A RUBBER DUCKY...
            ...A BOBBLE HEAD DOLL...
            ...An OLD BOOT...
            ...A TROPHY...
          
          - Wall-E finds a FIRE EXTINGUISHER.
            Activates it.
            FOAM blasts in his face.
            It's tossed far, far away from his cooler.
          
          - Wall-E's shovel hand strikes something solid.
            Faces a REFRIGERATOR much larger than himself.
            Now what?
          
          - CU on fridge door.
            A WELDING BEAM moves down its center.
            It emits from between Wall-E's SPLIT BINOCULAR EYES.
          
                                                                        7.
          
          
           The door falls apart in two pieces. Reveals...
          
          ...a SMALL PLANT
          
          in its early stage of growth.
          Wall-E is entranced.
          Carefully, he extracts the section of earth around it.
          
          CLOSE ON IGLOO COOLER
          
          Wall-E gently places the plant inside the old boot.
          Dusts dirt off the leaves.
          
          
          EXT. TRUCK - DUSK
          
          Robot and faithful cockroach return home.
          Wall-E stops short of the threshold.
          Stares at the ground.
          Continues staring.
          
          A RED DOT
          
          quivers on the dirt.
          A single laser point of light.
          Wall-E moves to touch it...
          
          ...The dot races along the ground.
          
          Wall-E drops his Igloo.
          Chases after the dot.
          
          
          EXT. EMPTY BAY
          
          The dot leads Wall-E deep into the polluted expanse.
          He is so fixated on it he doesn't notice
          
          MANY LASER POINTS
          
          coming from every direction.
          All racing into the valley over the contour of the terrain.
          Triangulating towards a center.
          
          Wall-E's dot suddenly stops.
          Slowly he reaches for it.
          Can't grab it. Just light.
          ALL THE DOTS converge in front of him.
          The ground shakes.
          Wall-E becomes confused.
          
          Doesn't see above him.
          The SUN growing brighter behind the cloud cover.
          A noise. Building.
          
                                                                  8.
          
          
          Rocket engines.
          Wall-E senses he should look to the sky.
          
          Now THREE SUNS are descending on him.
          
          Wall-E runs for it.
          An enormous COLUMN OF FIRE blocks his path.
          A second column of fire.
          A third.
          Trapped.
          
          Wall-E cubes the ground beneath him.
          Working fast.
          Noise deafening.
          Heat rising.
          Digs in just as a tide of flame carpets the ground...
          
          ...Then suddenly quiet.
          Smoke clears.
          
          CLOSE ON THE SCORCHED EARTH
          
          Wall-E's head rises out of the dirt.
          Glows red hot from the heat.
          Trembles with fright.
          Everything in shadow.
          Something very big looms over him.
          Wall-E climbs out of his hole.
          Bangs his head on metal.
          
          WIDE on a massive SPACESHIP.
          Rests ominously in the empty bay.
          
          A PORTAL on its underside opens.
          Frightened, Wall-E tries to hide.
          Nowhere to go.
          He places a SMALL ROCK on his head. Boxes up.
          
          A DEVICE lowers to the ground on a long stem.
          Scans the surface.
          
          Wall-E creeps closer for a better look.
          The device unfolds.
          Wall-E boxes up again.
          
          A CAPSULE descends from a chute in the stem.
          ROBOT ARMS emerge from the device.
          Place the capsule on the ground. Press buttons.
          The capsule falls away in sections, to reveal...
          
          ...a PROBE ROBOT.
          
          It hovers gracefully above the ground.
          White. Egg-shaped.
          
                                                              9.
          
          
          Blue-lit eyes.
          Female.
          Eve.
          
          Wall-E is transfixed.
          Inches closer.
          Watches Eve from behind the device.
          Tilts his head.
          Time stops.
          She's the most beautiful thing he's ever seen.
          
          Eve hovers over the ground.
          A BLUE RAY emits from her front panel.
          Fans out 180 degrees.
          Scans random objects and areas.
          
          The device rises back into the ship.
          Exposes Wall-E.
          He rushes for cover behind the nearest rock.
          Never takes his eyes off Eve.
          Watches her float away from the ship.
          ...from the ship?
          The ship!
          
          Engines roar back to life.
          Wall-E digging furiously.
          The rocket takes off.
          
          Smoke clears.
          Again, a red hot Wall-E peeks out from the ground.
          Looks for Eve.
          She is watching the ship rise into the clouds.
          Waits until it is completely out of sight...
          
          ...then Eve rises high up into the air.
          
          She flies around the bay.
          Soars like a graceful bird.
          Does loops in the sky.
          Zooms right past Wall-E's rock.
          He is hypnotized.
          
          Eve descends gently to the ground...
          Wall-E sneaks up closer.
          Hides behind another boulder.
          Slips.
          Makes a NOISE.
          Instantly, Eve whips around.
          Her arm converts into a LASER CANNON.
          Blasts Wall-E's boulder to smithereens.
          
          ...Smoke clears...All quiet.
          
          Eve, now cold and dangerous.
          
                                                                   10.
          
          
          Scans the area.
          No sign of life.
          All business again.
          Hovers away to probe more of the planet.
          
          ON OTHER SIDE OF BOULDER CRATER
          
          Wall-E boxed up behind what little remains of the rock.
          Trembles uncontrollably.
          
          
          EXT. AVENUE OF TRASH - DAY
          
          Eve wanders through the pillars of cubed trash.
          Scans random areas.
          Wall-E spies from the shadows.
          Too frightened to approach.
          She moves on. He follows.
          
          
          EXT. TIRE DUMP - DAY
          
          Eve probes a mound of tires.
          Wall-E hiding nearby.
          He flinches at the sight of
          
          HIS COCKROACH
          
          innocently approaching Eve from behind.
          She spins around.
          Blasts the insect.
          Wall-E is gut-punched.
          
          The cockroach climbs out of the smoking crater.
          Unscathed. Still curious.
          
          Eve finds the insect intriguing.
          Lowers her arm.
          The end separates into individual hovering sections...
          
          ...A HAND.
          
          She lets the insect crawl up her arm.
          Wiggles into her workings.
          It tickles.
          
                                       EVE
                          [Giggles]
          
          Wall-E relaxes.
          CHUCKLES privately.
          
          Eve sonically picks up Wall-E's location.
          Locks onto him.
          
                                                                   11.
          
          
          Arm converts to laser cannon.
          Fires rapidly.
          Quick glimpses of Wall-E dodging the blasts.
          Trash piles are systematically obliterated around him.
          
          Wall-E now exposed.
          Nowhere to hide.
          Boxes himself up. Shakes uncontrollably.
          Eve holds her fire.
          
                                     EVE
                               (electronic hums)
                        [Identify yourself.]
          
          She slowly approaches Wall-E's box.
          Keeps her gun trained on him.
          
                                     EVE
                               (electronic hums)
                        [Repeat. Identify yourself.]
          
          Wall-E peeks out from his box.
          Doesn't understand a thing she says.
          Doesn't care.
          Can't believe she's real.
          The cockroach climbs down her gun arm.
          Jumps onto his master.
          
          Eve scans Wall-E.
          A RED LIGHT appears on her chest.
          Buzzes "negative".
          He's not what she's looking for.
          She retracts her gun arm.
          Hovers off.
          Wall-E watches her go. Lovestruck.
          
                                     WALL-E
                        [Sigh.]
          
                                                           DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          INT. ABANDONED BNL SUPERSTORE - NEXT DAY
          
          LOUIS ARMSTRONG'S "LA VIE EN ROSE" PLAYS
          
          Eve scans through the market.
          Wall-E follows from a safe distance.
          A stray puppy-dog.
          
          Eve glances over at him.
          Wall-E panics.
          Bumps into a RACK OF SHOPPING CARTS.
          Creates an avalanche.
          
                                                                      12.
          
          
          They chase him down a flight of stairs.
          Wall-E reaches the exit doors.
          Won't open!
          Carts pig pile on top of him.
          
          
          EXT. BNL REFINERY - NIGHT
          
          Wall-E perched on the roof.
          Patiently watches Eve fly.
          She scans the ground below her, like a searchlight.
          
          Eve comes in for a landing below.
          Shuts down for the night.
          Wall-E waits.
          Quietly sneaks down the refinery fire escape.
          Accidentally trips. Tumbles to the ground.
          Eve doesn't wake.
          Wall-E creeps up to her.
          Opens his arms wide...
          ...and measures her.
          Turns to a pile of trash.
          Splits open his eyes. Begins welding something...
          
                                                              DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          EXT. BNL REFINERY - NEXT MORNING
          
          Eve powers up again.
          Does a double take.
          A TRASH SCULPTURE OF EVE stands in front of her.
          She hovers away, unimpressed.
          Doesn't notice Wall-E hiding behind a PILE OF PIPES.
          Wall-E kicks the pipes in frustration.
          They roll on top of him.
          
          SONG ENDS
          
          MONTAGE OF EVE SEARCHING
          
          - Scans a car engine.
            Negative.
            Slams the hood shut.
          
          - Scans a Port-A-Potty.
            Negative.
            Slams the door shut.
          
          - Scans an Apollo capsule.
            Negative.
            Slams the hatch shut.
          
          - Scans a FREIGHTER HOLD.

           Negative.
           Slams the lid shut.
          
          
          EXT. DERELICT SHIPYARD - DUSK
          
          Eve hovers over the freighter.
          Frustrated.
          Not finding what she's looking for.
          Wall-E eavesdrops from afar.
          
          Eve flies past the ship's CRANE MAGNET.
          Gets stuck.
          Wrestles to free herself.
          Furious, she BLOWS UP THE ENTIRE SHIP.
          The reaction startles Wall-E.
          
          Eve slumps down against a dredged anchor.
          She gives up.
          Concerned, Wall-E cautiously approaches.
          Sits at the other end of the anchor.
          Both robots stare silently at the fiery wreck.
          Then...
          ...slowly, very slowly, Wall-E inches towards her.
          Musters the courage to speak, when --
          She suddenly turns to him:
          
                                      EVE
                               (hums)
                        [So what's your story?]
          
          Wall-E falls backwards with surprise.
          Me?
          Eve scrolls through a variety of languages:
          
                                     EVE

                                     WALL-E
                        [Huh?]
          
                                     EVE

                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Oh, I understand that!]
          
                                                          14.

                        Directive?
          
          Wall-E eagerly turns to some nearby trash.
          Scoops it into his compactor.
          Proudly spits out a cube.
          Points to Eve.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (struggles to speak)
                        Di...rec...t--
          
                                       EVE
                        Directive?
          
          Wall-E nods.
          
                                       EVE
                        Classified.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Oh. Sorry.]
          
          She scans his CHEST LOGO.
          
                                       EVE
                        Name?
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (struggles again)
                        W-wally? ...Wall-E.
          
                                     EVE
                               (smooth; almost perfect)
                        Wwww-aaaa-leee...
          
          Wall-E nearly melts.
          She says his name so beautifully.
          Moves closer.
          
                                       EVE
                        Wall-E.
                                 (giggles)
                        Eve.
          
          Wall-E tries to repeat it:
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Eeee...?
          
                                       EVE
                                 (slower)
                        Eve.
          
                                                                 15.
          
          
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Eeeaaah?
          
                                     EVE
                        Eeeve. Eeeve.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Eee--vah!
          
          She giggles again.
          Wall-E likes making her giggle.
          
                                     WALL-E
                        Eee-vah! Ee --
          
                                       EVE
                        Eve.
          
          The wind kicks up.
          The WARNING LIGHT sounds on Wall-E's chest.
          He moves to grab her.
          
                                     WALL-E
                        (Gasp!) Eee-vah!
          
                                      EVE
                               (hums)
                        [Hey watch it! Don't come any closer!]
          
          She draws her gun on him.
          Doesn't understand the danger.
          The sandstorm rushes up behind her.
          Too late.
          Wall-E collapses into a box.
          The storm hits full force.
          Eve is instantly lost, disoriented.
          
                                     EVE
                        Wall-E? Wall-E?
          
          WALL-E'S HAND appears out of the dust.
          Calmly takes Eve's hand.
          
          
          INT. TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER
          
          The back door lowers.
          A rush of wind and sand.
          Wall-E pulls Eve inside. Closes the door.
          She coughs up dust.
          
          Wall-E hits a switch...
          Strings of CHRISTMAS LIGHTS fill the space.
          His racks of oddities painted in colored light.
          
                                                                   16.
          
          
          An air of enchantment.
          Eve is taken aback.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Come on in.]
          
          She drifts through the sea of knickknacks.
          Becomes spooked by a SINGING BILLY BASS FISH.
          Threatens to shoot it, but Wall-E calms her down.
          He is compelled to show her everything.
          Hands her an eggbeater...
          ...bubble wrap (so infectious to pop)...
          ...a lightbulb (lights when she holds it)...
          ...the Rubik's Cube (she solves it immediately)...
          ...his Hello Dolly tape.
          Curious, she begins unspooling the tape.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (loud beeps)
                        [My tape!!]
          
          He grabs it back. Protective.
          Inserts it carefully into the VCR. Please still work.
          The movie eventually appears on the TV.
          Plays a clip of POYSC.
          Wall-E is relieved.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [What do you think?]
          
          Mimics the dancing for Eve.
          Encourages her to try.
          She clumsily hops up and down.
          Makes dents in the floor. Rattles everything.
          Wall-E politely stops her.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [How `bout we try a different move?]
          
          Spins in a circle. Arms out.
          Eve copies.
          Spins faster, and faster...
          Too fast.
          Accidentally strikes Wall-E. He flies into the shelves.
          
          Eve helps him up from the mess.
          Wall-E's LEFT BINOCULAR EYE falls off.
          Dangles from two wires.
          Eve GASPS with concern.
          Wall-E placates her.
          
                                                                      17.
          
          
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [It's fine.]
          
          Feels his way to the rack of shelves.
          Rotates them until...
          ...SPARE WALL-E PARTS appear.
          Replaces his broken eye with a new one.
          Eve is relieved.
          
          She eyes his LIGHTER COLLECTION.
          Flicks open a Zippo. Ignites a FLAME.
          Wall-E freezes.
          He had no idea it could do that.
          Moves closer to inspect it...
          
          ON WALL-E
          
          It's the closest he's ever been to Eve.
          She remains focused on the lighter.
          Wall-E stares up at her.
          ...The tiny flame flickering between them...
          ...The Hello Dolly video plays IOTAM in the background...
          Suddenly, he is moved to express his love.
          Musters the courage to open his fingers...
          ...Timidly reaches his hand out to hers...
          
          -- Eve turns and looks at him.
          
          Wall-E instantly chokes.
          Pulls his hand back.
          Eve becomes intrigued with the TV.
          Scans the image of the lovers singing IOTAM...
          Wall-E watches her.
          His infatuation still palpable.
          Then he remembers...
          
                                    WALL-E
                        Ee-vah!
          
          He rushes to his shelves.
          Eve watches him rummage through junk.
          A drum falls down on his head.
          She giggles, charmed by it all.
          Something about Wall-E...
          
          She is drawn back to the lovers on TV...
          ...then the lit Zippo lighter in her hand.
          A tap on her shoulder.
          She turns to find Wall-E holding something.
          
          The plant.
          
          Eve immediately locks onto it.
          
                                                                    18.
          
          
          Drops the lighter.
          In a flash...
          ...her chest opens...
          ...a TRACTOR BEAM snatches the plant away...
          ...stores it inside her...
          Then she shuts down completely.
          Only a SINGLE GREEN LIGHT pulsing on her chest.
          
          Wall-E is stunned.
          What'd I do?
          Waves his hand in front of her face.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Ee-vah?
          
          Knocks on her chest plate.
          No response.
          Wall-E panics.
          Gently shakes her.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Ee-vah?
          
          Still no response.
          
                                     WALL-E
                        Ee-vah? ...Ee-vah?!
          
          CAMERA MOVES IN on the blinking green light...
          
                                                            DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          EXT. ROOF OF WALL-E'S TRUCK - DAY
          
          The morning sun.
          Wall-E places Eve in his charging spot.
          Aims her hovering form to face the sun.
          Waits.
          
          MONTAGE OF WALL-E TRYING TO REVIVE EVE:
          
          - Several hot days pass with Wall-E holding vigil in the heat.
          
          - A THUNDERSTORM approaches on the horizon.
            Wall-E holds an UMBRELLA over Eve.
            Gets struck by lightning.
            Holds up another umbrella.
            Gets struck again.
          
          - A SANDSTORM blows through.
            Wall-E pops out of a dune on the truck's roof.
            Lifts up an UPSIDE-DOWN BARREL that protected Eve.
          
                                                               19.
          
          
          
          - Wall-E pries open a panel on Eve's chest.
            Reveals her pulsing BLUE HEART-BATTERY.
            Attaches JUMPER CABLES to his own HEART-BATTERY.
            Tries to connect the other end to hers.
            An automatic defense system blows him off truck.
          
          - Wall-E & cockroach take Eve for a walk.
            Pull her along on a LEASH OF CHRISTMAS LIGHTS.
          
          - Wall-E gives Eve a boat ride on a LAKE OF SLUDGE.
            Uses an industrial tire as a boat.
            Rows like a gondolier with a road sign.
          
          - Wall-E sits by the empty bay with Eve.
            Watches the SUNSET.
            Burns "WALL-E + EVE" on a public trash can.
            Tries to pull out her hand to hold it.
            It snaps back into place, trapping his hand.
          
          END OF MONTAGE
          
          
          EXT. ROOF OF WALL-E'S TRUCK - NIGHT
          
          Wall-E has set up the TV on the roof.
          The blank Eve floating next to him.
          Tries unsuccessfully to play PONG with her.
          Still no response.
          Finally, he gives up.
          
                                        WALL-E
                           [defeated sigh]
          
          
          EXT. TRUCK - NEXT MORNING
          
          Wall-E loads up his cooler.
          Checks on Eve one more time.
          Still nothing...
          Heads off to work, defeated.
          
          
          EXT. WORK SITE - LATER
          
          Wall-E simply going through the motions.
          No spirit in him at all.
          Stops.
          Pulls out the Zippo lighter.
          Flicks it a few times.
          A RUSH OF WIND blows out the flame.
          Distant rumbling.
          Wall-E looks in the direction of his home.
          A BRIGHT GLOW is lowering down through the clouds.
          
                                                             20.
          
          
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Oh no.]

          Wall-E racing as fast as he can.
          The cockroach clings onto him for dear life.
          
          
          EXT. TRUCK - DAY
          
          The RECON SPACESHIP towers over his truck.
          A ROBOT ARM cherry-picks Eve from the roof.
          Lifts her up and into the ship's cargo hold.
          Wall-E racing in the distance.
          
                                     WALL-E
                        EE-VAH!! EE-VAH!!
          
          Reaches the end of the collapsed bridge ramp.
          Forced to watch Eve disappear into the ship.
          The cargo doors slam shut.
          
          The first of the THREE ROCKET ENGINES powers up.
          Wall-E heads down a hill of rubble to the ship.
          Notices his cockroach tagging along behind him.
          Leads it back to the top of the hill.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Stay.]
          
          The insect mopes.
          Droops its little antennae.
          Wall-E motors back down to the rocket...
          
          BASE OF RECON SHIP
          
          The engines blast a WALL OF SMOKE.
          Preparation for launch...
          
          
          INT. RECON SHIP
          
          Eve is secured into a slot.
          Joins a ROW OF OTHER EVE PROBES.
          All dormant.
          Only Eve flashes a GREEN LIGHT.
          The CAMERA DRIFTS BACK out a window...
          
          OUTSIDE THE SHIP
          
                                                                    21.
          
          
          
          ...where Wall-E steadily climbs up the side.
          The ship's engines ignite.
          Wall-E clamps his hands tight to a metal support.
          The rocket takes off into space.
          
          
          EXT. TOP OF HILL
          
          The cockroach watches his master go.
          
          
          EXT. RECON SHIP
          
          The spaceship roars through the sky.
          Wall-E tightens his grip, battling the G's.
          He looks ahead. SCREAMS.
          
          HUNDREDS OF BNL SATELLITES
          
          litter the outer atmosphere.
          The ship bursts through the layer.
          
          
          EXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS
          
          The recon ship breaks free of the planet.
          Its boosters shut down.
          Wall-E takes in the sudden QUIETNESS OF SPACE.
          Looks back at his planet.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Oooh...
          
          Weightlessness takes effect.
          Wall-E almost floats away.
          Grabs hold of the ship.
          Knocks on a WINDOW near Eve.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        E-vah!
          
          No response. She remains shut down.
          Wall-E points out at the stars.
          It is the most spectacular light show possible.
          And Wall-E has a front row seat.
          
          MONTAGE OF CELESTIAL SPECTACLES
          
          - The ship flies past the MOON.
            A BILLBOARD stands next to the abandoned APOLLO MOON ROVER.
            "BNL Outlet Coming Soon."
          
          - The ship passes by the SUN.
            Wall-E pops open his solar panels.
          
                                                                     22.
          
          
           Instantly recharges.
          
          - The ship cruises alongside SATURN'S OUTER RINGS.
            Wall-E runs his hand through the tiny particles of ice.
          
                                                            DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          EXT. RECON SHIP - DAYS LATER
          
          A DUMBBELL NEBULA slowly twists in space.
          Wall-E is mesmerized by it.
          Leads his eye to a LIGHT, growing in the distance ahead.
          A planet?
          No. A starliner.
          Gigantic in size.
          
          The "AXIOM".
          
          The now tiny recon ship heads straight for it.
          
          
          INT. DOCKING BAY
          
          TWO TUG-ROCKETS guide the ship in.
          It locks into GIANT BRACES fixed on the deck.
          The impact knocks Wall-E off.
          He lands in the scaffolding of the front brace.
          
          Suddenly the entire dock comes to life.
          Robotic arms and service robots of all types appear.
          ...Rise from the floor...
          ..Lower from the ceiling...
          It's a cacophony of automation.
          They all attend to the ship.
          
          EVE
          
          and four other probes slide out of the ship's side.
          Suspended in a horizontal rack.
          Wall-E is surprised to find her facing him.
          She remains shut down.
          Just a few feet away with a giant abyss between them.
          
                                       WALL-E
                         Ee-vah... ?
          
          A SQUAD OF CLEANER ROBOTS emerge onto the dock.
          A small roller BRUSH-BOT (M-O) leads.
          
                                      M-O
                                (beeps)
                         [Hold up.]
          
                                                                   23.
          
          
          Waits for the FLOOR LINES to appear.
          Depict their exact path of action.
          
                                     M-O
                               (beeps)
                        [Okay. Go.]
          
          They file out on the line.
          
          A crane-bot lowers Eve from the rack.
          M-O and his cleaning crew stand ready.
          M-O scans Eve.
          
          ON M-O'S DISPLAY POV
          
          Scan reads: "%16 Foreign Contaminant."
          
          M-O is disgusted.
          Revs his brush roller. Moves in for the clean.
          A VACU-BOT follows after him.
          Then a SPRAY-BOT and BUFFER-BOT finish off.
          
          The cleaning crew waits for probe #2.
          Wall-E studies the routine.
          Figures out a way to climb down to Eve.
          When the crane returns, Wall-E poses as probe #3.
          The crane grabs him instead.
          
          M-O turns around to clean the next probe.
          Wall-E is lowered in front of him.
          Boxes up.
          Confused, M-O scans him.
          
          ON M-O'S DISPLAY POV
          
          Scan reads: "%100 Foreign Contaminant."
          M-O is horrified by such filth.
          A RED SIREN LIGHT rises from his head.
          
                                     M-O
                        [Oh, no, no, no. This is all wrong.]
          
          He scrubs Wall-E full force.
          Wall-E's front panel pushes him away.
          Confused, M-O moves to clean him again.
          Wall-E backs away.
          Leaves a DIRT TRAIL.
          M-O curses:
          
                                     M-O
                        [You made the floor all dirty! Stop it!]
          
                                                                    24.
          
          
          M-O furiously scrubs the floor.
          Wall-E peeks out, amused by this neurotic little guy.
          
          ON FAR WALL
          
          Two STEWARD ROBOTS come out of the wall.
          Act like hovering caution signs.
          A small robot (GOPHER) shoots out a PNEUMATIC TUBE.
          He bears epaulet like shoulders and a siren for a face.
          Gopher beeps an ELECTRONIC ORDER for the Stewards to follow.
          
          BACK ON M-O AND WALL-E
          
          M-O just finishes cleaning the floor.
          Wall-E is fascinated.
          Impishly makes another mark.
          M-O compulsively cleans it. Can't resist.
          
                                     M-O
                        [Look, it stays clean. You got that?]
          
          Wall-E wipes the bottom of his tread on M-O's face.
          M-O loses it.
          Scrubs his own face.
          
          Gopher and his steward escort arrive.
          The cleaning crew stand at attention.
          Wall-E boxes back up with the probes.
          
          Gopher begins scanning each probe.
          Moves down the line.
          Scans Wall-E...moves on to the next probe...
          Stops -- Wait a minute.
          Turns back.
          Wall-E is gone.
          Gopher shrugs it off. Proceeds...
          Reaches Eve.
          Doesn't notice Wall-E hidden behind her.
          Gopher scans her BLINKING PLANT LIGHT --
          
          The entire dock goes to "Code Green"!
          
          Alarms sound.
          Green lights flash.
          All automation stops.
          
          In rapid succession...
          ...A HOVER-TRANSPORT glides up to Gopher...
          ...A crane-bot loads Eve...
          ...Curved energy bands lock her down...
          ...Gopher assumes the driver's seat...
          
          It's all moving too fast for Wall-E.
          Suddenly Eve's transport heads for the ELEVATOR.
          
                                                                    25.
          
          
          
                                      WALL-E
                          Ee-vah!
          
          Wall-E chases after them.
          Grabs onto the back of the transport.
          They disappear into the elevator.
          
          The cleaning crew files out.
          Follow their lines back to their hold.
          M-O stops short.
          Notices Wall-E's FILTHY TRACKS crossing his path.
          
          ON M-O'S DISPLAY
          
          Reads: "FOREIGN CONTAMINANT"
          
          The tracks lead to the elevator.
          M-O's neurosis takes over.
          Must clean dirt.
          He makes a radical decision and...
          ...jumps off his line.
          Starts methodically cleaning the dirt trail.
          
          
          INT. ELEVATOR
          
          Gopher waits patiently as the floors pass.
          Wall-E hidden behind the transport.
          Peeks at Eve.
          Pets her blank faceplate.
          
                                       WALL-E
                                 (quiet beeps)
                          [It'll be okay, Eve.]
          
          The ELEVATOR DOORS suddenly open.
          
          
          INT. ROBOT SERVICE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
          
          DOZENS OF ROBOTS speed along a multi-lane passageway.
          All following glowing lines on the floor.
          Wall-E's head whipsaws back and forth.
          Tries to process it all.
          Doesn't notice Gopher's transport merge into traffic...
          ...without him!
          
          Wall-E shrinks from the high-speed traffic.
          Timidly attempts to merge.
          Sticks out one tread...
          -- Instantly causes a ROBOT PILE-UP.
          Wall-E boxes up. Guns it.
          Weaves across all the lines on the floor.
          Bounces off robots like bumper cars.
          
                                                                     26.
          
          
          Barely able to navigate the chaos.
          Takes refuge in the middle of an INTERSECTION.
          Scans for Eve...
          
          ON WALL-E'S POV DISPLAY
          
          ...a PAINT-BOT paints a wall sign...
          ...A GARBAGE-BOT dumps trash into a wall chute...
          ...Down the hall, Eve's transport glides up a ramp...
          
                                     WALL-E
                        EE-VAH!
          
          Wall-E chases after them.
          
          
          INT. UPPER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Wall-E flies up the ramp.
          Nearly collides with a merging HOVER CHAIR.
          It blocks his way.
          Wall-E gains alongside it, and discovers
          
          A HUMAN PASSENGER
          
          sitting, reclined, in the chair.
          He is large, round and soft - like a big baby.
          Wears a red, BNL jumpsuit.
          The chair seems to be steering itself.
          Guided by floor lines, just like the robots.
          Speaker headrests block his peripheral vision.
          A HOLOGRAPHIC SCREEN floats inches in front of his face.
          He converses with a SECOND PASSENGER on screen:
          
                                     PASSENGER #1
                        Well, I've been in my cabin all morning
                        so let's hover over to the driving range
                        and hit a few virtual balls into space.
          
                                     PASSENGER #2 (ON SCREEN)
                        Nah, we did that yesterday. I don't want
                        to do that.
          
                                     PASSENGER #1
                        Well then what do you want to do?
          
          ON WALL-E
          
          He looks over his shoulder.
          Passenger #2 is floating right next to them.
          Isolated in his own hover chair.
          Also in a red jumpsuit. Also a big baby.
          
                                                                       27.
          
          
          
                                     PASSENGER #2
                        I don't know. Something.
          
          Both humans are totally unaware of the other's presence.
          They all exit the hallway. Merge into the...
          
          ECONOMY CLASS COURTYARD
          
          Wall-E is in awe.
          Hundreds of floors of GUEST ROOMS rise on all sides.
          THOUSANDS OF PASSENGERS fill the giant space.
          All reclined and riding on hover chairs.
          MULTIPLE FLOOR LINES guide their chairs in all directions.
          
          Humans have become the most extreme form of couch potatoes.
          Absolutely no reason to ever get up.
          No purpose.
          Every one of them engrossed in their video screens.
          Cocooned in virtual worlds.
          Over-developed fingers tap ARMREST KEYPADS.
          The controls allow them to steer...
          ...order food...
          ...play games...
          ...and most of all...
          
          ...CHAT MINDLESSLY with other passengers:
          
          The CHATTER is deafening.
          No one notices Wall-E at all.
          He drives into the endless human traffic.
          
                                     MISC. FEMALE PASSENGER
                        Bot, over here!
          
          A DRINK-BOT floats over to a passenger.
          Puts a fresh drink in her open hand.
          Wall-E flows with the traffic into a LARGE TUNNEL.
          
                                     MISC. PASSENGERS
                        I can't hear you...I'm in a tunnel.
                        You're breaking up...Oh, okay. You're
                        back. I can hear you now...
          
          They spill out into the BRIGHT LIGHT of the
          
          MAIN CONCOURSE (COACH CLASS)
          
          A city-sized, mall-like environment.
          All under a GIANT DOME.
          The ceiling simulates the sun and sky.
          A BNL LOGO (w/ time & temp) appears on the FACE OF THE SUN.
          
                                                                    28.
          
          
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        Buy N Large. Everything you need to be
                        happy. Your day is very important to us.
          
          Wall-E is gobsmacked.
          A PASSENGER (JOHN) hovers up alongside him.
          Tries to hand off his empty drink cup to Wall-E.
          
                                     JOHN
                        Hey, Drink-bot.
          
          Wall-E shies away.
          John reaches farther out with the cup.
          
                                     JOHN
                        Here, take the cup. Take the cup -- Whoa!
          
          Reaches too far.
          John falls to the floor.
          Flails like an upside down turtle.
          Unable to stand on his baby legs.
          
          Instantly, SIRENS.
          Wall-E watches TWO STEWARDS arrive.
          Block John's accident.
          EMERGENCY LINES appear on the floor.
          Redirect the hover chair traffic.
          John reaches out for assistance.
          Nobody notices. Just drive past.
          
                                     JOHN
                        Stewards? Hello? Uhh, help.
          
                                     STEWARD
                        Please remain stationary. A service-bot
                        will be here to assist you momentarily.
          
          Suddenly John begins to rise.
          
                                     JOHN
                        Uhh...Hey! What's going on?
          
          Wall-E lifting him up from behind.
          Loads him back onto his chair.
          John doesn't know how to react.
          Wall-E waves hello.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Wall-E!
          
                                       JOHN
                        Uhh... John.
          
                                                                       29.
          
          
          
                                          WALL-E
                           Ee-vah?
          
                                          JOHN
                           Uh no, John.
          
          Wall-E scans the concourse.
          Spots Eve's transport about to board a MONORAIL.
          He races after them.
          Abandons the stunned John.
          
                                          WALL-E
                           Ee-vah!
          
                                        JOHN
                                  (small wave)
                           Bye...Wall-E.
          
          ON MONORAIL
          
          It pulls out of the station.
          Wall-E leaps on.
          Barely catches the last car.
          It glides down the concourse.
          
          
          INT. "ALL DAY" CARE CENTER
          
          A NANNY-BOT supervises a group of TODDLERS.
          All wearing matching BNL ONESIES.
          Motionless in their HOVER RINGS.
          They stare at educational programming on their holo-screens.
          
                                        NANNY-BOT

          OUT THE WINDOW
          
          Wall-E's monorail glides past.
          
          ON MONORAIL
          
          Wall-E takes in the overstimulating scenery.
          Dozens of THEMED FOOD RESTAURANTS whizz by.
          Each specialty is served in the same JUMBO PLASTIC CUP.
          
                                        SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                           Mmmmm! Time for lunch in a cup.
          
          Wall-E now notices his fellow passengers.
          They all slurp from similar cups.
          
                                                                    30.
          
          
          Next, the monorail passes a BEAUTY SALON.
          BEAUTICIAN-BOTS primp and style passengers.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        Feel beautiful.

                        ...It's the new you...Oh stunning...You
                        look great...I know honey...Ahh. Men...
          
          They pass through the FASHION DISTRICT.
          ENORMOUS BILLBOARDS hawk the latest color schemes.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        Attention, Axiom shoppers. Try blue! It's
                        the new red!
          
                                    MONORAIL PASSENGERS
                        Oooohh...
          
          Passengers next to Wall-E press their chair buttons.
          Their JUMPSUITS change from RED TO BLUE.
          
                                    WALL-E
                        Whoa.
          
          Their monorail speeds into a glass tunnel.
          
          INSIDE THE TUNNEL
          
          Wall-E looks past a PASSENGER (MARY) next to him.
          Spots Eve on the other side.
          Wall-E tries to sneak behind Mary.
          But her chair moves backwards.
          Smashes Wall-E against the back wall.
          No way getting past her.
          Wall-E politely tries to get Mary's attention.
          She's oblivious.
          Chats incessantly on her holo-screen:
          
                                     MARY
                        Date?! (derisive snort) Don't get me
                        started! Every holo-date I've been on has
                        been a virtual disaster! If I could just
                        meet one who wasn't so superficial. There
                        are no good men out there!...
          
          Wall-E tries to fold back her speaker headrest.
          Accidentally breaks it off.
          
                                     MARY (CONT'D)
                        ...I know! I know `cause I've scrolled
                        through them all -- (Gasp) What the --?
          
                                                                    31.
          
          
          
          Mary's chair shorts out.
          ...holo-screen shuts off...
          ...jumpsuit defaults back to red...
          For the first time Mary has an unobstructed view.
          Her eyes slowly dilate.
          It's as if she's seeing the world for the first time...
          
                                     MARY
                               (mesmerized)
                        Huh... ?
          
          Her gaze falls on Wall-E.
          He waves politely.
          
                                        WALL-E
                        Wall-E.
          
                                        MARY
                               (beat)
                        M-mary.
          
                                        WALL-E
                        Ee-vah.
          
          He points to Eve on the other side of Mary.
          Gestures he'd like to get by.
          She is slow to understand.
          
                                     MARY
                        Huh? Oh, uh, sure go ahead.
          
          Mary moves her hover chair back.
          Wall-E rolls over to Eve.
          Pats her protectively.
          
                                        WALL-E
                        Ee-vah...
          
          
          INT. AXIOM/LIDO DECK - DAY
          
          The monorail emerges into "First Class."
          A vast, circular plaza of pools.
          Surrounded by a ring of high rise apartments.
          Hundreds of passengers lounge poolside.
          All serviced by their personal UMBRELLA-BOTS.
          
                                       POOLSIDE PASSENGER
                                 (claps; umbrella-bot opens)
                        Shade.
          
          ON MONORAIL
          
          It stops at the BRIDGE PLAZA.
          
                                                                     32.
          
          
          The base of the Axiom's Bridge Tower.
          The passengers exit.
          Follow their respective lines.
          Gopher drives Eve (and Wall-E) towards the tower.
          Pass over a GIANT BNL LOGO on the plaza floor.
          
          ON MARY
          
          She is the last to exit the car.
          Doesn't follow any lines.
          Excited by her newfound awareness.
          Looks out on the Lido Deck as the monorail pulls away.
          
                                     MARY
                        I didn't know we had a pool!
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE LOBBY
          
          Eve's transport enters the cavernous hall.
          A lone TYPING-BOT is stationed at the far end.
          A bridge elevator behind him.
          Blocked by a force field gate.
          
          The transport pulls up to the typing-bot.
          Gopher BEEPS.
          The typing-bot responds by typing.
          Slowly. One...button...at...a...time...
          
          Finally, the gate lowers. Elevator doors open.
          The typing-bot watches the transport enter the elevator.
          Notices Wall-E hiding at the back.
          Wall-E gives it a FRIENDLY WAVE as the doors close.
          The elevator shoots up to the bridge.
          
          The typing-bot looks at its hand.
          Mimics Wall-E's waving gesture.
          Huh. Never done that before.
          Tries it some more...
          
          INSIDE THE ELEVATOR
          
          Wall-E looks out on the descending Lido Deck.
          Marvels at it all.
          His view suddenly goes dark.
          The elevator doors open on...
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
          
          The large circular room is dimly lit.
          Windows to SPACE on one side, a LIDO DECK view on the other.
          A massive console wraps around its entirety.
          Covered in buttons. A sea of thinking lights.
          
                                                                     33.
          
          
          A CAPTAIN'S WHEEL automatically steers.
          
          Gopher drives into the middle of the room. Beeps.
          Suddenly the wheel disengages.
          The autopilot (AUTO).
          A single camera eye lights up its center.
          A periscope stem connects Auto to the ceiling.
          Slides along rails up to Gopher, who salutes.
          Auto eyes Eve. Scans her.
          Wall-E sneaks back into the shadows.
          
          Auto detects Eve's plant light.
          Goes still...
          Begins computing rapidly.
          The number "A113" flashes on his lens.
          An ELECTRONIC EXCHANGE begins between Auto and Gopher.
          
          Wall-E watches the interchange. Nervous.
          Without warning, Auto heads in his direction.
          Wall-E boxes up.
          A CIRCULAR SECTION OF FLOOR lights directly below him.
          Irises open, like a trapdoor.
          
          Wall-E drops...

          ...and hits the floor hard in the room below.
          Someone stirs, then resumes SNORING.
          
          Auto lowers through the portal.
          A CLOCK ALARM BUZZER activates.
          
                                        AUTOPILOT
                           Captain. You are needed on the bridge.
          
          Shoots back up. The portal closes.
          Wall-E peeks out of his box.
          
          ON WALL-E'S POV
          
          PAN across the nautical-themed cabin.
          One wall lined with PORTRAITS OF FORMER CAPTAINS.
          Their years of service listed below.
          The autopilot in the background of each picture.
          Each generation of Captain more devolved than the other.
          From human to gelatinous blob.
          We stop on the FINAL PORTRAIT.
          A blobby Captain.
          It looms above the actual CAPTAIN, snoring in bed.
          
          He reaches out in his sleep to quiet the snooze alarm.
          Smacks Wall-E's box by mistake.
          
                                                                    34.
          
          
          Activates the POYSC SAMPLE.
          It plays loud.
          The Captain sits straight up, half-awake:
          
                                       CAPTAIN
                          -- All hands on deck!!
          
          Wall-E is frantic to turn off the music as...
          ...PREP ROBOTS burst from the cabinetry...
          ...a BEAUTICIAN-BOT, MASSAGE-BOT and WARDROBE-BOT...
          ...The Captain's bed automatically raises...
          ...Forms into a hover chair...
          The robots rapidly massage, brush, primp and dress him.
          
                                       BEAUTICIAN-BOT
                                 (pre-recorded)
                          Morning! Just a trim?
          
          Wall-E blends in with the primping.
          Uselessly wiggles the Captain's toes.
          
                                      CAPTAIN
                          (Giggles)
          
          Lines light on the floor.
          Lead his chair automatically to the elevator.
          Wall-E sneaks aboard just as the doors close.
          
          ON THE BRIDGE
          
          Elevator doors swish open.
          The Captain still half-asleep.
          Claps his hands twice.
          
          On cue, a COFFEE MAKER rises from the console.
          Pours a cup.
          CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS on overhead speakers.
          The Captain's chair links with a LIT FLOOR PATH.
          Leads him over to the coffee.
          Wall-E stays lockstep behind him.
          Auto glides over to the Captain.
          
                                      AUTOPILOT
                          Sir --
          
                                      CAPTAIN
                          Coffee.
          
          Wall-E hides under the console just in time.
          
          The Captain reaches for his coffee.
          Makes a minimal effort.
          Easier to adjust his chairback slowly forward...
          ...almost there...and...he grabs the coffee.
          
                                                                        35.
          
          
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Sir, the annual --
          
          The Captain gives Auto the hand.
          Sips his coffee.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Protocol, Auto. First things first.
                               (to the room)
                        Computer, status report.
          
          His chair automatically arcs along the console.
          SPECIFIC PANELS light up as he passes.
          
                      CAPTAIN                       SHIP'S COMPUTER

          He eyes Eve on the transport across the room.
          Has to get to her.
          But Auto is right above him. Can't move.
          
                                      AUTOPILOT
                        Captain...
          
          Auto calls up a screen on the console.
          Displays the recon-ship and a flashing positive probe.
          Waits patiently for the Captain to notice.
          Finally, the Captain turns...
          
                                      CAPTAIN
                        Okay, Auto.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Sir, the annual reconnaissance has --
          
          ...but then notices the time.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        12:30?!
                               (disappointed sigh)
                        Auto, why didn't you wake me for the
                        morning announcements?
          
          He slingshots his chair to the Lido Deck side of the bridge.
          Wall-E nearly collides with him.
          
                                                                       36.
          
          
          Ducks back under the console.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Honestly, it's the one thing I get to do
                        on this ship.
          
          Grabs a large dial.
          TIME OF DAY ICONS surround it.
          Cranks it from mid-day back to sunrise.
          
          OUT ON LIDO DECK
          
          - The FAKE NOON SUN reverses at high speed to a SUNRISE.
          - Passengers' LUNCH CUPS switch to BREAKFAST CUPS.
          - Poolside passengers' umbrella-bots close up.
          
          An ANNOUNCEMENT WHISTLE BLOWS over the intercom.
          A SECTION OF SKY DOME becomes a JUMBOTRON SCREEN.
          Displays a live video feed of the Captain.
          The image also shows up on every passenger's CHAIR SCREEN.
          
                                     CAPTAIN (ON INTERCOM)
                               (unmotivated)
                        Well, good morning everybody, and welcome
                        to day 255,642 aboard the Axiom. As
                        always, weather's a balmy 72 degrees and
                        sunny, and -- Oh, hey, I see the ship's
                        log is showing that today is our 700th
                        anniversary of our five year cruise.
                        Well, I'm sure our forefathers would be
                        proud to know that 700 years later we'd
                        be...
                               (deflates)
                        ...doing the exact same thing...they were
                        doing...
          
          Cut to VARIOUS ASPECTS OF AXIOM LIVING.
          The listening passengers look just as bored as the Captain.
          
                                     CAPTAIN (INTERCOM)
                               (snaps out of ennui)
                        SO! Be sure next mealtime to ask for your
                        free...
                               (hard to pronounce)
                        ...septuacentennial cupcake -- in a cup.
                        Also today we have, uh...uh...Hey, Auto,
                        what's that flashing button?
                               (mic feedback whine)
          
          BACK ON THE BRIDGE
          
          The Captain stares at a FLASHING BUTTON on the console.
          It bears the same PLANT ICON as Eve's display.
          
                                                                  37.
          
          
          
                                    AUTOPILOT (O.S.)
                        Captain?
          
          The Captain turns to Auto.
          For the first time he notices Eve. Finally.
          Auto hovers over her. Salutes.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Probe One has returned positive.
          
                                    CAPTAIN
                        Positive?
          
          Auto re-activates Eve.
          She wakes.
          Rises to salute the Captain.
          
          Across the room, Wall-E watches with sheer joy.
          She's okay!
          He is compelled to head straight for her...
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        But...no probe's ever come back
                        positive...
                               (looks at flashing button)
                        ...before.
          
          The flashing button is practically calling to him.
          Can't resist. Presses it.
          Instantly SHADES close on all the windows.
          The room goes dark.
          
          ...Wall-E is forced to hide under the console again...
          
          A LARGE HOLO-SCREEN appears right above him.
          Pre-recorded footage of the BNL CEO plays:
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                        Greetings and congratulations, Captain!
                        If you're seeing this, that means your
                        Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator,
                        or...
                               (air quotes)
                        ..."EVE" probe, has returned from Earth
                        with a confirmed specimen of ongoing
                        photosynthesis!
          
          The Captain stares slack-jawed at the screen.
          Wall-E sneaks under the console towards Eve...
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                        That's right, it means it's time to go
                        back home!
          
                                                                     38.
          
          
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (nervous)
                        Home? W-w-we're going back?
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                        Now that Earth has been restored to a
                        life-sustaining status, by golly, we can
                        begin "Operation Recolonize"!
          
          A section of the console illuminates.
          An ancient, dusty MANUAL slides out...
          
          ...into a passing Wall-E's hands.
          
          Wall-E immediately boxes up.
          Holds the manual over his head.
          The Captain mistakes Wall-E for a book podium.
          Grabs the manual. Blows dust off the cover.
          It reads: "OPERATION RECOLONIZE".
          Below the title, the same PLANT ICON from Eve's display.

                        Simply follow this manual's instructions
                        to place the plant in your ship's holo-
                        detector, and the --
                               (bad edit)
                        -- Axiom -- will immediately navigate
                        your return to Earth! It's that easy!
          
          ON VIDEO SCREEN (DURING SPEECH)
          
          An animated diagram depicts a stage below the ship's bridge.
          The symbol of a HOLO-DETECTOR rises up.
          A STICK FIGURE places a plant inside the machine.
          A STARLINER ICON flies back towards Earth.
          
          The Captain listens closely to the instructions.
          Wall-E paying attention as well.
          
                     CAPTAIN                          WALL-E
          Huh?                               Huh?
          
          Wall-E notices he has a clear shot to Eve.
          Heads in her direction.

                        Now, due to the effects of micro-gravity,
                        you and your passengers may have suffered
                        some slight bone loss. But I'm sure a few
                        laps around your ship's jogging track
                        will get you back in shape in no time.
          
          The Captain looks at his VESTIGIAL LEGS.
          
                                                                   39.

                        If you have any further questions just
                        consult your operation manual. See you
                        back home real soon.
          
          The transmission ends.
          The Captain examines the manual.
          Holds it out in front of him.
          
                                     CAPTAIN

                        Manuel, relay instructions. Manuel?
          
          Auto intervenes.
          Clips the corner of the cover with his handle...
          ...and simply opens the book.
          The Captain is both fascinated and intimidated.
          Lifts the cover with his own fingers.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Wow... Will you look at that?
          
          ON EVE
          
          Wall-E taps her shoulder.
          Not now Wall-E -- Double take!
          
                                    EVE
                        Wall-E?!

                               (tiny wave)
                        Ee-vah!
          
          Eve is in a state of disbelief.
          Shoves Wall-E into the shadows under the console.
          
                                     EVE
                               (hushed; angry)
                        [Wall-E, what are you doing here?! You
                        can't be here! You're going to get me in
                        trouble!...]
          
          Makes a flurry of clandestine gestures at him.
          Wall-E just stares at her.
          Smitten.
          
                                                                      40.
          
          
          
                                        WALL-E
                                  (swoons)
                           Ee-vah...
          
          ON THE CAPTAIN
          
          He manages to turn to the FIRST PAGE OF INSTRUCTIONS.
          
                                        CAPTAIN
                                  (reads aloud)
                           Well, let's open her up. Step One. Voice
                           command, "Confirm Acquisition."
          
                                        SHIP'S COMPUTER
                           Confirm Acquisition.
          
          The bridge suddenly jumps to life.
          Green lights flash.
          A LARGE DEVICE appears from the ceiling...
          ...Scans the entire room...
          ...Identifies Eve...
          ...Rides along the ceiling rails...
          ...Stations itself directly above Eve...
          ...Arms unfold. Position her...
          ...A VOICE ARM swings into the Captain's face:
          
                                        SHIP'S COMPUTER
                           Voice authorization required.
          
                                       CAPTAIN
                           ...Uh...
          
                                       SHIP'S COMPUTER
                           Accepted.
          
          A BUTTON-PUSHING ARM lowers.
          Presses a sequence of buttons on Eve...
          Her chest lights up.
          The doors open.
          The Captain winces...
          
          ...and nothing is inside.
          
                                        CAPTAIN
                           Where's the thingie?
          
                                       AUTOPILOT
                           Plant.
          
                                        CAPTAIN
                           Plant. Right. Right. Where is it?
                                  (checks manual)
                           Maybe we missed a step. Show me how you
                           change the text again...
          
                                                                    41.
          
          
          
          Auto and the Captain turn away. Re-read the manual.
          Eve is stunned.
          Searches her chest cavity for the plant.
          Then she remembers...
          
                                     EVE
                        Plant! Wall-E...
                               (turns on him)
                        Wall-E!
          
          Wall-E flinches. Surprised by her anger.
          Eve opens Wall-E's chest. Empty.
          Picks him up. Scans the floor.
          Nothing.
          
                                     WALL-E
                        Ee-vah?
          
                                     EVE
                               (angry electronics)
                        [Find it!] PLANT!
          
          Wall-E scared of her.
          Starts searching.
          
                                     CAPTAIN (O.S.)
                        Why don't you scan her to be sure.
          
          Eve jumps back to attention.
          Auto slides up to her.
          Scans her chest cavity.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Contains no specimen. Probe's memory is
                        faulty.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        So, then...we're NOT going to Earth?
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                               (shakes his wheel)
                        Negative.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        So, uh, I guess things go back to normal,
                        huh?
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Correct, Captain.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (privately relieved)
                        Well, false alarm!
          
                                                                    42.
          
          
          
                                       SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        False alarm.
          
          Instantly the plant retrieval device retracts.
          Exits back into the ceiling.
          The shades rise.
          Lights go back on.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        The probe must be defective. Gopher, send
                        her to the Repair Ward.
          
          Eve turns.
          Excuse me?
          Gopher hops to attention.
          Traps Eve in his SUSPENSION BEAM.
          Loads her back onto the transport...
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Have them run diagnostics on her. Make
                        sure she's not malfunctioning -- EEYAH!!
          
          ...and reveals WALL-E.
          Everyone stares at him.
          Long awkward pause.
          Wall-E innocently motors over to the Captain.
          Shakes his hand.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Wall-E.
          
          Leaves a CLUMP OF DIRT in his palm.
          The Captain stares at it.
          Turns to Auto.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Have "Wall-E" cleaned.
          
          
          INT. LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER
          
          The elevator opens.
          Gopher's transport drives out.
          Both Eve and Wall-E strapped on it with energy bands.
          The typing-bot has now mastered waving.
          Waves an enthusiastic goodbye.
          Wall-E tries to get Eve's attention.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Ee-vah?
          
          She gives him the cold shoulder.
          Refuses to speak to him.
          Wall-E shrinks.
          
                                                                    43.
          
          
          The transport exits the lobby.
          
          BACK UP IN THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS
          
                                    CAPTAIN
                        Analyze.
          
          The CLUMP OF DIRT is suspended in a beam of light.
          It rotates.
          The captain sits at his vanity console.
          ANALYSIS DATA scrolls on a HOLO-SCREEN.

                        to as "soil", "dirt", or "earth".
          
          The last word piques his interest.
          
                                    CAPTAIN
                        Earth?
          
          His eyes drift to a GLOBE on his shelf.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Define "Earth"...
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER
                        "Earth" - the surface of the world as
                        distinct from the sky or sea.
          
          Dozens of IMAGES OF LAND pop up on screen.
          Lush, green, colorful, inviting.
          He's fascinated.
          Takes it all in.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Wow... Define "sea".

          THROUGH THE WINDOW we see the Captain.
          Glued to his screen.
          Filled with ocean images.
          
                                                                     44.

          The CAMERA DRIFTS AWAY from the window...
          ...Moves aft to the Axiom's stern...

          INT. ROBOT SERVICE TUNNEL
          
          M-O continues to clean WALL-E'S FILTHY TRAIL.
          Oblivious to everything around him.
          Cuts through traffic.
          Robots crash into each other in his wake.
          M-O doesn't notice EVE AND WALL-E'S TRANSPORT drive past.
          They hover down a corridor, and enter...
          
          
          INT. REPAIR WARD - CONTINUOUS
          
          It's a fully automated clinic for broken bots.
          Day care for the malfunctioned.
          The REJECTS are kept in FORCE FIELD PENS.
          Dozens line the walls.
          
          Eve and Wall-E stop at the INSPECTION STATION.
          Robotic ORDERLY-ARMS activate.
          Wall-E shrinks.
          Watches them systematically check in Eve.
          Perform an I.D. scan.
          Attach a RED "DEFECT" BOOT to her head.
          A button is pressed on the boot.
          Eve goes into "sleep" mode. Lifted off the transport.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Where are you going?!]
          
          The orderly-arms now start on Wall-E.
          He escapes before they can place a defect boot on him.
          Races through the ward.
          Wall-E runs smack into a defective BEAUTICIAN-BOT.
          
                                     BEAUTICIAN-BOT
                               (pre-recorded)
                        Just a trim? Uh huh.
          
          She paints Wall-E's face with hideous looking make-up.
          Holds up a mirror.
          Wall-E gasps.
          
                                                                     45.

                        You look gorgeous.
          
          Wall-E is snatched up by an orderly-arm.
          Placed in an empty force field pen.
          Sits between a PAINT-BOT and VACU-BOT:
          ...The broken paint-bot flings paint at Wall-E...
          ...The vacu-bot sneezes dust in his face...
          Across the way a MASSAGE-BOT flails wildly.
          Orderly-arms restrain him with an ENERGY STRAIGHTJACKET.
          
          Eve slides past Wall-E.
          Carried by an orderly-arm.
          Brought into the "DIAGNOSTICS" ROOM.
          The frosted glass doors shut.
          
                                    WALL-E
                        Ee-vah!
          
          
          INT. DIAGNOSTICS ROOM
          
          Orderly-arms run diagnostics on a few reject robots:
          
          - An UMBRELLA-BOT flips open and overextends.
            The orderly-arms struggle to close it.
          
          - A DEFIBRILLATOR-BOT shocks a CRASH-TEST-DUMMY.
            It bursts into flames.
          
          Eve is awoken from "sleep" mode.
          A series of tests begin.
          Eve is annoyed but calm.
          It's all routine.
          An orderly-arm easily detaches her gun arm.
          
          OUT IN THE REPAIR WARD
          
          Wall-E stares at the frosted glass doors.
          Can only make out EVE'S SILHOUETTE.
          To him, her arm is being ripped off.
          
                                    WALL-E
                        Ee-vah!
          
          BACK INSIDE WITH EVE
          
          The orderly-arm tests Eve's circuitry.
          Her insides light up.
          It tickles.
          
                                    EVE
                        (Giggles)
          
                                                                    46.
          
          
          
          Next to her the UMBRELLA-BOT's mechanism SCREECHES.
          
          OUTSIDE WITH WALL-E
          
          Wall-E watches in horror.
          It looks as if Eve is being tortured.
          Mistakes the screeching for her screams.
          Wall-E struggles to free himself.
          
          INSIDE WITH EVE
          
          She is washed and scrubbed.
          A CIRCULAR BUFFER cleans between her head and body.
          It feels good.
          
          BACK ON WALL-E
          
          It looks as if Eve is being beheaded.
          He needs to stop the torture.
          Wall-E fires his CUTTING LASER at his pen's force field.
          The barrier shorts out.
          Wall-E tumbles to the floor.
          Lands on his "Play" button.
          POYSC blares across the ward.
          The Rejects all stop and stare.
          
                                       WALL-E
                          EEEEEEVAAAAHH!!
          
          Wall-E races to the diagnostics room.
          Crashes right through the glass doors.
          Finds Eve surrounded by orderly-arms.
          Grabs Eve's separated gun arm.
          Points it at the orderly-arms.
          
                                       WALL-E
                                 (angry beeps)
                          [Let her go, or I'll shoot!]
          
          His hands tremble, Don Knotts-style.
          Doesn't realize...
          
          ...he's holding the gun backwards.
          
          Eve slowly reaches for the weapon.
          
                                       EVE
                                 ("Put the gun down...")
                          Wall-E...
          
          An orderly lunges at him.
          Wall-E panics. Shoots!
          The gun fires backwards.
          It blasts through the repair ward.
          
                                                                    47.
          
          
          Blows up the REPAIR WARD CONTROL PANEL.
          
          Wall-E shrinks.
          He knows he's in trouble.
          
                                      EVE
                        WALL-E!
          
          The smoking remains of the control panel SHORT CIRCUIT.
          ...All orderly-arms go limp...
          ...The repair ward doors open up...
          ...and all FORCE FIELDS disappear...
          
          The Rejects look at each other for a beat.
          Then CHEER wildly.
          We're free!
          
          The mob of robots all rush Wall-E.
          Lift him on their shoulders.
          Carry their hero out of the ward.
          Wall-E still holding on to Eve's gun arm.
          
          Eve watches in astonishment.
          This day just gets worse and worse.
          She flies off after them.
          
                                      EVE
                        WALL-E!
          
          
          EXT. REPAIR WARD/ROBOT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          The rejects march Wall-E out the entrance.
          Their RED "DEFECT" BOOTS all blink.
          Activate a WARNING LIGHT above the doorway.
          
                                                          MATCH CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. ROBOT SERVICE TUNNEL
          
          EMERGENCY LIGHTS blinking.
          Activate an embedded ROW OF STEWARDS.
          They pop out of the wall.
          Race to the repair ward.
          Sirens wailing.
          
          
          INT. ROBOT HALLWAYS
          
          The REJECT MOB stampedes through the halls.
          Disrupts all robot traffic.
          Wall-E carried over their heads.
          Suddenly, the mob stops in front of...
          
                                                                    48.
          
          
          
          ...a BLOCKADE OF STEWARDS.
          
                                       STEWARD
                        Halt.
          
          Wall-E's dropped in front of them.
          Still holds Eve's gun.
          Cowers.
          A TINY ROBOT pushes Wall-E closer.
          Show `em who's boss.
          
                                       EVE
                                 (stern)
                        Wall-E!
          
          Eve catches up to them.
          Flies over to Wall-E.
          Snatches her arm back.
          Just as she reattaches her gun...
          
          ...The steward CAMERA EYES take a snapshot of them.
          
          ALL AROUND THE SHIP
          
          Alarms sound.
          SCREENS appear, displaying EVE AND WALL-E'S IMAGE.
          She appears to brandish her gun at camera.
          Like Bonnie and Clyde.
          Their faces now on every wall...
          ...passenger's hover chair...
          ...cabin...
          ...hallway...
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER

                        robots...
          
          BACK WITH EVE AND WALL-E
          
          The stewards prepare to fire SUSPENSION BEAMS (like Gopher).
          Eve realizes what's about to happen.
          Grabs Wall-E.
          Flies over the stewards.
          
                                       STEWARDS
                        Halt. Halt.
          
          The mass of rejects take their cue.
          Robot rebellion!
          They bust through the steward blockade.
          
          ON VARIOUS HALLWAYS
          
          Robots recognize Eve and Wall-E as they fly past.
          
                                                                 49.
          
          
          Match them with the "Wanted" screens.
          Call attention to them. Point.
          Stewards in hot pursuit.
          
          Eve hides herself and Wall-E in a PORTHOLE CUBBY.
          Lets the stewards pass by.
          She glances out the porthole...
          
          ON EVE'S POV
          
          She can see the DOCKING BAY below her.
          Just under the bay doors...
          
          ...a row of EMERGENCY ESCAPE PODS.
          
          Eve gets an idea.
          Grabs Wall-E and flies down the hallway...
          
          INSIDE AXIOM ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Eve and Wall-E ride in uncomfortable silence.
          Their "WANTED" IMAGE plays on an elevator screen.
          
                                      SHIP'S COMPUTER (SCREEN)
                         Caution: Rogue robots.
          
          Wall-E points to it.
          
                                      WALL-E
                                (beeps)
                         [Hey look! We're on TV -- !]
          
          Eve aims her gun at the screen.
          Blows it to pieces.
          Wall-E shrinks into a box.
          Never mind.
          
          
          INT. ESCAPE POD BAY/OVER HALLWAY
          
          Dark.
          The elevator chimes.
          Eve and Wall-E step out.
          Rows of NUMBERED BAY DOORS line the hallway.
          Eve approaches "Bay #1".
          She and Wall-E enter...
          
          
          INT. ESCAPE POD BAY #1 - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eve navigates the dark.
          Approaches a freestanding CONSOLE.
          Fiddles with some buttons.
          
                                                              50.
          
          
          
          ON WALL-E
          
          He glances down at EVE'S HAND.
          Privately intertwines his fingers.
          Maybe now is the right moment...
          
                                       WALL-E
                                 (quiet)
                          Ee-vah...?
          
          FLASH!
          Banks of controls light up around them.
          
          AN ESCAPE POD
          
          is revealed at the end of the room.
          Its hatch automatically opens.
          Bathes the room with light from its lit interior.
          Eve turns to Wall-E:
          
                                       EVE
                          Earth.
          
          She points to an OVERHEAD SCREEN.
          It displays coordinates to Earth.
          
                                       EVE
                          Earth.
          
          She gestures for Wall-E to enter the pod.
          He happily complies.
          Jumps up on one of the seats.
          Pats the seat next to him.
          Aren't you coming?
          
          Eve remains at the threshold.
          Shakes her head.
          Points to her chest.
          Makes her PLANT SYMBOL glow.
          
                                       EVE
                          Directive.
          
          ...She's not going.
          
          This changes everything.
          Wall-E races out of the pod.
          Boxes up.
          
                                       WALL-E
                                 (beeps)
                          [Then I'm not going either.]
          
          Eve shakes her head.
          
                                                                        51.
          
          
          
                                        EVE
                                  (gentle, but firm)
                         Wall-E.
          
          Carries his box back into the pod.
          Exits.
          Wall-E follows her right back out.
          Drives behind the console.
          You can't make me.
          Eve sighs.
          
                                        EVE
                                  (frustrated)
                         Wall-E.
          
          The hallway elevator CHIMES.
          They both look up.
          Someone is coming.
          
          Eve shuts off everything.
          Lights go out. The pod closes back up.
          Both Eve and Wall-E hug the wall.
          Blend in with the other wall fixtures.
          
          They HEAR something hover into the     room.
          Can't see what it is.
          Then...
          An EPAULET ROBOT ARM rises up over     the console.
          Presses buttons.
          The pod lights up again. The hatch     opens.
          The stranger's SHADOW comes around     the console to reveal...
          
          GOPHER
          
          Eve and Wall-E look at each other.
          Gopher?
          They watch from the shadows as...
          ...Gopher enters the pod...
          ...opens his chest cavity...
          ...emits his suspension beam...
          
          ...and deposits the PLANT.
          
                                        EVE
                                  (excited whisper)
                         Plant!
          
          Gopher exits the pod.
          
          CLOSE ON EVE
          
          She keeps her eyes on Gopher.
          Watches him return to the console.
          She turns to speak to Wall-E --
          
                                                              52.
          
          
          He's gone.
          
                                       EVE
                                 (whisper)
                        Wall-E?
          
          Wall-E is inside the pod.
          Picks up the plant.
          Proudly shows it to Eve.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (loud whisper)
                        Ee-vah!
          
                                       EVE
                                 (louder whisper)
                        Wall-E!
          
          Too late.
          Gopher hits a button.
          The pod door shuts on Wall-E...
          
          ...and launches into space.
          
          Gopher shuts off the room.
          Exits.
          
          Eve leaps out of the shadows.
          Looks out the POD BAY WINDOW.
          Wall-E's pod rapidly shrinking in the distance.
          The plant icon on Eve's chest glows.
          She rushes to a narrow SERVICE AIRLOCK.
          Enters it like a phone booth.
          
          OUTSIDE THE AIRLOCK
          
          Eve bursts out into space.
          Rockets after Wall-E.
          
          
          INT. ESCAPE POD
          
          Wall-E plastered against the back of the pod.
          It suddenly reduces speed.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        Cruising speed.
          
          He drops to the floor.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        You are now free to move around the
                        cabin.
          
                                                                    53.
          
          
          
          Wall-E fumbles to get his bearings.
          Peers out the rear hatch window.
          Sees the Axiom receding from view.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Yikes!]
          
          He clambers up into the pilot's seat.
          Pulls back hard on the throttle.
          Nothing happens.
          Looks down at the console.
          A SELF-DESTRUCT DIAL is counting down:
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        Twenty seconds till self-destruct...
          
          Uh oh.
          Wall-E frantically hits the SELF-DESTRUCT button.
          No change.
          Pushes every button on the console.
          Everything activates:
          ...Lights flash...
          ...Oxygen masks drop...
          
          OUTSIDE THE POD
          
          ...Windshield wipers activate...
          ...Flares fire off...
          ...Parachutes deploy...
          
          BACK INSIDE THE POD
          
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        Ten seconds till self-destruct...
          
          Wall-E panics.
          Looks for a means of escape.
          Spots the hatch.
          Grabs the pod's FIRE EXTINGUISHER.
          Shoots himself to the door.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER
                        Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four,
                        three, two...
          
          Pulls on the EMERGENCY EXIT LEVER.
          The hatch won't open!
          
          ON EVE
          
          She races through space after him.
          Suddenly, in the distance, the POD EXPLODES.
          
                                                                 54.
          
          
          Eve is gut-punched.
          
                                     EVE
                        No, no, no...
          
          She flies towards the debris field, when --
          
          Wall-E whizzes right past her.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Ee-vaaaaaah!
          
          He holds the FIRE EXTINGUISHER.
          Uses it as a form of propulsion.
          Eve is consumed with relief.
          Chases after him.
          
          ON WALL-E
          
          He points the extinguisher the other way.
          Attempts to fly back over to her.
          It's hard to steer...
          
          ...They rocket right past each other again...
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Stay there! I'll come to you!]
          
          Eve waits.
          Wall-E finally has the hang of steering.
          Fires short bursts.
          Very slowly...makes his way...to Eve.
          Gets extinguisher foam in her face.
          She giggles.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               ("Look what I've got")
                        Ee-vah...
          
          He opens his compactor door.
          Pulls out the PLANT, still in the boot.
          
                                       EVE
                                 (Gasp!)
          
          ON EVE'S DISPLAY POV
          
          ...Sensors zero in on the plant...
          ...Confirm its authenticity...
          ...A MAP OF THE AXIOM appears...
          ...Draws directions to the bridge...
          ...A command flashes: "DELIVER TO AXIOM SUPERIOR"...
          
                                                           55.
          
          
          
          Eve is ecstatic.
          She snaps the plant up with her tractor beam.
          Seals it safely in her chest.
          Then scoops up Wall-E in her arms.
          Spins him around.
          
                                     EVE
                        Wall-E! (Laughs)
          
          Wall-E can't believe his luck.
          Rests his head on her shoulder.
          Bliss.
          
          Eve stops spinning.
          Leans her head against his.
          A tiny ARC OF ELECTRICITY passes between them.
          A "thank you" kiss.
          
          Wall-E's METER spikes.
          He floats circles in space.
          
                                    WALL-E
                              (swoons)
          
                                      EVE
                               (hums)
                        [Come on. Time's a wastin'.]
          
          She reaches for his hand.
          Wall-E shakes his head.
          Holds up his extinguisher instead.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [I can fly myself.]
          
          Kicks on the extinguisher.
          Spins in a pirouette...
          ...and flies away.
          Eve giggles.
          Chases after him.
          
          BING CROSBY'S "STARDUST" PLAYS
          
          The two fly around the stern of the ship.
          Wall-E does a few barrel rolls.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Try that.]
          
          Eve giggles.
          Matches him move for move.
          
                                                                   56.
          
          
          The pair fly between the BOOSTER ENGINES of the ship.
          Weave in and out of the rocket flames.
          Bank up along the ship's port side.
          Execute a double helix in perfect unison...
          
          
          INT. AXIOM'S OBSERVATION DECK - SAME
          
          Passengers hover down the hallway.
          All focused on their private screens.
          No one looks out at the stars.
          
          ...except for MARY.
          
          She has pulled over to the side.
          Stares wistfully out the DECK WINDOW.
          
                                      MARY
                               (sigh)
                        So many stars.
          
          Spots EVE & WALL-E dancing among the stars.
          
                                     MARY
                        Oooh...
                               (recognizes Wall-E)
                        Hey, that's what's his name --
          
          She backs up to wave hello.
          Bumps into JOHN'S HOVER CHAIR.
          
                                     JOHN
                        Hey! What the --
          
          Mary leans over to his armrest.
          Turns off his holo-screen.
          Points out the window.
          
                                     MARY
                        Look! Look at THAT!
          
                                     JOHN
                               (disoriented)
                        Wha...huh?
          
          Wall-E flies past the window.
          A wave of recognition hits John.
          He comes to life, as if wakened from a long sleep.
          
                                     JOHN
                        Hey... I know that guy! It's, uh...
                               (snaps fingers)
                        Wall-E! Hey Wall-E! It's your buddy, John!
          
                                                                       57.
          
          
          
                                     MARY
                        Right, Wall-E! Hi Wall-E!
          
          They both wave until Wall-E's out of sight.
          John absentmindedly lowers his hand to his armrest...
          
          ...and touches Mary's hand.
          
          Both turn towards each other.
          They make eye contact for the first time.
          Awkward beat.
          
                                       JOHN
                        Hi.
          
                                       MARY
                        Hi.
          
          OUTSIDE WITH WALL-E AND EVE
          
          They soar across the Axiom's bow.
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE
          
          Auto busy operating the ship.
          Doesn't see Eve and Wall-E outside the window.
          Auto turns the SKY DIAL from DAY TO NIGHT.
          
          INSIDE THE CONCOURSE
          
          The sky dome fast-forwards to evening.
          PAN OVER to the top of the bridge tower.
          The windows of the Captain's quarters are dark.
          Only the FLICKERING GLOW OF A HOLO-SCREEN lights the room.
          
                                     CAPTAIN (V.O.)

          INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT - SAME
          
          The Captain is still engrossed in his Earth research.
          MULTIPLE IMAGES litter the screen.
          Crops, farms, a barn, etc....
          An IMAGE OF PEOPLE SQUARE DANCING pops up.

                        "Hoedown" - a social gathering at which
                        lively dancing would take place.
          
          An aperture opens in the ceiling above.
          Auto lowers down to face the Captain.
          
                                                                     58.

                        These are called "farms". Humans would
                        put seeds in the ground, pour water on
                        them, and they'd grow food, like, pizza --

          Auto rises back up to the bridge.
          The aperture shuts. Lights out.
          The Captain glares at the ceiling.
          Then whispers conspiratorially to the computer.
          
                                     CAPTAIN

                        Define "dancing".
          
          BACK OUTSIDE THE AXIOM
          
          Eve and Wall-E descend along the starboard side.
          Spiral gracefully around one another.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        "Dancing" - A series of movements,
                        involving two partners, where speed and
                        rhythm match harmoniously with music.
          
          Wall-E's extinguisher runs out of foam.
          He lets it float freely out into space.
          Eve catches him in her arms.
          Wall-E croons.
          
          SONG ENDS
          
          Eve scans the Axiom for a way in.
          Notices SPARKS.
          Down on the ship's lower hull...
          
          CLOSER ON LOWER HULL
          
          A REPAIR-BOT (BURN-E) welds an antenna.
          Eve and Wall-E fly into the open hatch behind him.
          It shuts.
          Burn-e bangs on the closed door.
          Stuck outside.
          
                                                                    59.

                          Deck is now closing.
          
          The last few passengers exit the pool area.
          All wearing the same color blue uniforms...
          
          ...except TWO RED ONES still in the pool.
          
          CLOSE ON FEET
          
          They ripple the surface of the pool.
          John and Mary float over the water's surface.
          Splash one another playfully.
          
                                       JOHN
                          Hey now. Stop that...
          
                                       MARY
                          Make me (giggles).
          
                                       JOHN
                          I didn't know we had a pool.
          
          A LIFEGUARD-BOT (glorified megaphone) lowers from its tower.
          Reprimands them from the pool's edge:
          
                                       LIFEGUARD-BOT
                          No splashing, no diving.
          
                                       JOHN & MARY
                                 (annoyed)
                          Ahh! Go on!
          
          John splashes the robot.
          It shorts out.
          
          ON UPPER DECK
          
          Eve and Wall-E sneak onto the deck.
          Hide between a ROW OF TOWEL CARTS.
          Eve peeks through the towels.
          Surprised to discover TWO STEWARDS.
          On duty in front of the bridge lobby entrance.
          No way in.
          
                                                                    60.
          
          
          
          A TRASH-BOT passes.
          Dumps its load down a nearby TRASH CHUTE.
          Eve keys in on the chute.
          It runs all the way up the tower...
          
          ...to the bridge.
          
          ON WALL-E
          
          He stares at EVE'S HAND.
          Time to seize the moment.
          Hits the PLAY BUTTON on his chest.
          It Only Takes a Moment plays from his scratchy speaker.
          Puts his hands together...
          
          Eve whips around.
          What's that noise?!
          Wall-E holds his hands up to Eve...
          
                                        WALL-E
                           E-vah --
          
          Eve immediately shuts off his music.
          Shoves his hands down.
          
                                        EVE
                                  (hushed hums)
                           [Stop it! They'll hear us!]
          
          She places a stack of towels on his head.
          Gestures for Wall-E to stay put.
          Points to her PLANT LIGHT.
          
                                        EVE
                           Directive.
          
          Before Wall-E can even protest she is gone.
          Zooms silently across the Lido Deck.
          Up into the trash chute.
          
          CLOSE ON EARTH
          
          It sits in space.
          The AXIOM glides towards it.
          Something's not right.
          We reveal the CAPTAIN'S FINGERS holding the ship...
          
          
          INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - SAME
          
          The Captain sits by his window to space.
          Holds a toy AXIOM MODEL over his GLOBE OF EARTH.
          
                                                                      61.
          
          
          
                                       CAPTAIN
                          [Rocket noises] Prepare for landing...
                          [Landing noises] We're here everybody!
                          Yeah, Captain! [crowd cheers] Captain
                          we're home! It's so beautiful! [crowd
                          cheers]...No it's nothing. I was pleased
                          to do it. It's all about you people --
          
          ON TRASH CAN
          
          NOISES. Eve bursts out from it, like an angel.
          Blows the lid off.
          The Captain is stunned by this vision.
          She opens her chest to reveal...
          
          ...the plant.
          
                                       CAPTAIN
                                 (amazed)
                          How...? How'd you find it?!
          
          Eve hovers over to him.
          Salutes.
          Formally presents him the plant.
          He takes it in his hands.
          Still potted in the old boot.
          Gazes at it in wonder.
          
                                       CAPTAIN
                          We can go back home...for the first time!
                                 (laughs)
                          What's it like now?
          
          Eve shrugs.
          Doesn't know how to answer.
          
                                       CAPTAIN
                          No, no! Don't tell me! I want to see for
                          myself!
          
          He turns to his console.
          Hits a button.
          A CYLINDRICAL DEVICE rises from a panel.
          The Captain sticks it to the side of Eve's head.
          A HOLOGRAPHIC SCREEN projects from the device.
          Plays back images of her time on Earth.
          
          A COLLAGE OF IMAGES rapidly scroll past.
          All displayed from Eve's POV:
          ...Being delivered to Earth...
          ...Flying above the devastated landscape...
          ...Blowing up a rock...
          ...Scans of numerous trash locations...
          
                                                                 62.
          
          
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Wait...that doesn't look like Earth...
                        Where's the blue sky...
          
          He looks over to his computer screen.
          The BEAUTY IMAGES OF EARTH still on display.
          Compares them with what plays on Eve's screen.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        ...Where's the grass?
          
          His face drops.
          Slumps in defeat.
          The dream is over.
          
          ON EVE'S HOLOGRAPHIC SCREEN
          
          The HELLO DOLLY clip of POYSC plays...
          It stirs the Captain out of his funk.
          He looks up at the screen.
          Leans in for a closer look.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        ...I know that song...
                               (observes the dancers' feet)
                        And they're... dancing. Yes, dancing!
          
          A rueful smile grows on his face.
          He looks down at
          
          HIS FOOT
          
          It's tapping in time to the music.
          His gaze drifts over to the plant in his hands.
          He lifts it up.
          Makes the boot dance.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        ...You made it somehow, eh little guy?
                        You didn't give up, did you?
          
          As if in response, the plant wilts slightly.
          A leaf drops.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        (Gasp!) Oh no, no --
                               (remembers)
                        Wait a minute.
          
          The Captain urgently hovers across the room.
          Eve left alone.
          Her recorded memories continue playing...
          
          ...The clip changes to It Only Takes a Moment.
          
                                                          63.
          
          
          Eve recognizes the music.
          Watches the lovers on screen hold hands.
          Something familiar about the gesture...
          Looks at her own hands.
          Slowly, she interlocks her fingers...
          ...Eve's eyes go wide.
          This is what Wall-E was trying to say to her.
          
          Her memories continue on the screen:
          ...a tap on the shoulder...
          ...Wall-E presents her the plant --
          ...The screen goes BLACK!
          
          Then...
          
          ...SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE initiates.
          
          Wall-E's vigil for Eve plays out:
          ...protecting her from the rain...
          ...the sun...the sandstorm...
          ...keeping watch night and day...
          ...trying to jump start her heart...
          
          ON EVE
          
          Amazed at Wall-E's selfless dedication to her.
          Realizes the meaning of Wall-E's love.
          
                                        EVE
                               (soft)
                        Wall-E...
          
          She looks at her hands again.
          
          MATCH CUT TO CLOSE-UP OF WALL-E'S HANDS
          
          Still waiting between the towel racks.
          Rehearses holding out his hand to Eve.
          
                                     WALL-E
                        Ee-vah... Ee-VAH...? EEE-vah...
                               (gives up; beeps)
                        [I'll never get it right.]
          
          Becomes impatient.
          Sneaks his way over to the GARBAGE CHUTE.
          Sticks his head in.
          
                                        WALL-E
                        EE-VAHH?!
          
          No answer.
          The chute has an endless drop.
          Wall-E climbs in.
          
                                                                     64.
          
          
          Holds himself spread eagle to stay in place.
          Carefully inches his way up to the Captain's quarters...
          
          OUT ON THE UPPER DECK
          
          A monorail pulls up.
          M-O steps off.
          Still hot on Wall-E's trail.
          Scrubs the dirty tracks towards the bridge lobby.
          Then notices Wall-E's FRESH TRACKS...
          
          ...leading to the trash chute.
          
                                     M-O
                               (beeps)
                        [Ah-hah! Gotcha!]
          
          BACK IN THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS
          
          The Captain at his wet bar.
          Waters the plant in the sink.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        There you go little guy. You came a long
                        way for a drink of water... Just needed
                        someone to look after you, that's all --
          
          He is struck with a notion.
          Stares out the window at space for a beat.
          Sees HIS REFLECTION holding the plant.
          Glances at his EARTH GLOBE.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (to himself)
                        We have to go back.
          
          Activates his chair's call button.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Auto, come down here!
          
                                     AUTOPILOT (ON SPEAKER)
                        Aye-aye, sir.
          
          Eve is still watching Wall-E's vigil on the screen:
          ...playing Pong...
          ...Wall-E etches their names in a heart...
          Eve is lost in the moments.
          So touched.
          
                                     EVE
                               (smitten)
                        Wall-E...
                                     (MORE)
          
                                                                    65.
          
                                       EVE (CONT'D)
                                 (remembers)
                        Wall-E!
          
          He's still waiting for her.
          She turns to leave and finds
          
          AUTO
          
          lowering in front of her.
          Auto spots the plant in the Captain's hand.
          "A113" flashes on Auto's lens.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Auto, Eve found the plant. Fire up the
                        Holo-detector.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Not necessary, Captain. You may give it
                        to me.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (not listening)
                        You know what? I should do it myself.
          
          Heads for the elevator.
          
                                       AUTOPILOT
                        Captain!
          
          Auto shoots back upstairs.
          Pops out another APERTURE in front of the elevator.
          Blocks the Captain.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Sir, I insist you give me the plant.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Auto, get out of my way.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Sir, we cannot go home.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        What are you talking about? Why not?
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        That is classified. Captain, give me the
                        plant.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (holds plant out of reach)
                        What do you mean, "classified"? You don't
                        keep secrets from the Captain!
          
                                                                   66.
          
          
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Give me the plant.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Tell me what's classified!
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        The plant.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Tell me, Auto! That's an order!
          
          It's a stare down.
          Beat.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Aye-aye, sir.
          
          Auto rises back into the ceiling.
          Lowers down over the vanity console.
          High speed button pushing.
          A NEW BNL VIDEO MESSAGE appears.
          Labeled: "TOP SECRET: FOR AUTOPILOT EYE ONLY".
          The BNL FANFARE plays.
          Cut to the BNL CEO at the podium.
          Haggard. Nervous.
          Wears an emergency oxygen vest.
          The fanfare plays too long.
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                               (to O.S.)
                        Just cut it off, will ya?!
                               (music stops; forced chuckle)
                        Hey there, Autopilots! Uh, got some bad
                        news. Operation Cleanup has, uh, well...
                        failed! Wouldn't you know, rising
                        toxicity levels have made life
                        unsustainable on Earth.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Unsustainable? What?
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                        Darn it all, we're going to have to
                        cancel Operation Recolonize.
                               (dons his life vest)
                        So just, uh...just stay the course.
                        Rather than try to fix this problem,
                        it'll just be easier if everyone remains
                        in space.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (offended)
                        Easier?
          
                                                                    67.
          
          
          
                                     CEO ADVISOR (O.S.)
                        Mr. President, sir, it's time to go.
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                        Alright, uh...uh...I'm giving override
                        directive: "A113". Go to full autopilot.
                        Take control of everything! And do not
                        return to Earth!
                               (ready to run)
                        Repeat! Do not return to Earth!
                               (throws on his gas mask; to
                                camera crew)
                        Now let's get the heck out of here.
          
          The CEO races out of the room.
          The message cuts out.
          
          Auto turns to face the Captain.
          The Captain shakes his head in disgust.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Now, the plant.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        No, wait a minute. Computer, when was
                        that message sent to the Axiom?
          
          The paused image on the holo-screen highlights.
          Data begins to calculate on the screen.
          We see YEARS SCROLL RAPIDLY BACKWARDS.
          It stops on "2110".
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER
                        Message received in the year 2110.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        That's -- that's nearly 700 years ago!!
                        Auto, things have changed! We've got to
                        go back!
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Sir, orders are: "Do not return to
                        Earth".
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        But life is sustainable now! Look at this
                        plant, green and growing! It's living
                        proof he was wrong.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Irrelevant, Captain.
          
                                                                     68.
          
          
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        What?! It's completely relevant!
                               (points out to space)
                        Out there is our home! Home, Auto! And
                        it's in trouble! I can't just sit here
                        and...and...do nothing! That's all I've
                        done! That's all anyone on this blasted
                        ship has ever done...NOTHING!!
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        On the Axiom you will survive.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        I DON'T WANT TO SURVIVE! I WANT TO LIVE!
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Must follow my directive.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        DAAAARGH!!
          
          The Captain turns away in frustration.
          His eyes catch sight of the CAPTAIN PORTRAITS.
          Notices AUTO in every one of them.
          Looking over all their shoulders.
          A little closer every generation.
          The Captain slowly looks over his shoulder...
          ...and Auto is right behind him.
          The Captain looks at the plant in his lap.
          His countenance grows determined.
          He rights his hat...
          ...turns to face Auto...
          ...and gives the most authoritative order of his career:
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        I'm the Captain of the Axiom. We are
                        going home today!
          
          Auto slides into his face.
          Makes the Captain flinch.
          No more Mr. Nice Robot.
          Auto emits an ELECTRONIC COMMAND.
          
          GOPHER
          
          shoots out of a pneumatic tube.
          Salutes Auto.
          Eve immediately remembers him from the Pod Bay.
          She BEEPS a warning to the Captain.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Gopher?
          
          Gopher activates his suspension beam.
          
                                                                     69.
          
          
          Snatches the plant away from the Captain.
          
                                        CAPTAIN
                           Hey! That's my plant. This is mutiny!
                                  (to Eve)
                           Eve, arrest him!
          
          Eve draws her GUN ARM. Points it at Gopher.
          The robot raises his epaulet arms.
          Don't shoot!
          She opens her chest cavity.
          Motions for Gopher to put the plant inside her.
          
                                        CAPTAIN
                           Eve, you are to put this plant straight
                           in the Holo-detector.
          
          Gopher slowly advances towards Eve.
          But then tosses the plant across the room...
          
          ...down the TRASH CHUTE.
          
                                           CAPTAIN
                           No!
          
                                           EVE
                                  (hums)
                           [Oh no!]
          
          It's over.
          The plant is gone.
          But in that frozen moment...
          
          ON TRASH CHUTE
          
          ...THE PLANT suddenly reappears.
          Rises like a ghost, up from the chute.
          Wall-E's head follows.
          Unawares of the plant resting on his head.
          
                                           WALL-E
                           Ee-vah?
          
                                           CAPTAIN & EVE
                           WALL-E!!
          
          Wall-E straddles the top of the lip chute.
          The plant drops onto his chest.
          Wall-E looks at it with surprise.
          
                                        WALL-E
                                  (beeps)
                           [Hey, the plant.]
          
                                                                    70.
          
          
          
                                     CAPTAIN & EVE
                        Wall-E! The plant!...[Toss it! Over here!]
          
          Wall-E is slow to understand.
          Finally picks up the plant.
          Anticipates to throw it, when...
          ...Auto lowers right in front of him, trying to block.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Give me the plant.
          
          Eve moves to help Wall-E.
          But Gopher traps her in his suspension beam.
          
          Wall-E dodges Auto's multi-arm advances.
          Defiantly tosses the plant into his chest.
          Slams it shut.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [You can't have it!]
          
          Auto flips open one of his handles.
          Produces a TASER...
          
          ...and ELECTROCUTES Wall-E.
          
          Wall-E's chest circuitry blows out.
          He wheezes...
          ...then drops lifelessly down the chute.
          
          Eve screams.
          Gopher floats her trapped form over to Auto.
          The button on her DEFECT BOOT is pressed.
          She shuts down.
          
          INSIDE THE GARBAGE CHUTE
          
          Gopher's ray holds Eve over the opening.
          Drops her down the chute.
          She bangs against the sides as she tumbles.
          
          BACK IN THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS
          
          Gopher salutes Auto and exits.
          Auto turns to the Captain.
          He is in shock.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        All communications are terminated. You
                        are confined to quarters.
          
          The power shuts off in the room.
          Auto rises back up through the ceiling...
          
                                                                     71.
          
          
          
          DOWN SHOT THROUGH BRIDGE FLOOR APERTURE
          
          The Captain looks up.
          Shakes his fist in fury.
          
                                      CAPTAIN
                         NO! MUTINY! MUTINY! MUTINEEEEE!!
          
          The aperture closes TO BLACK.
          
          Beat.
          
          ON EVE'S POV
          
          Black.
          The word "REBOOT" suddenly flashes.
          Her view comes into focus.
          Scans around. Disoriented.
          
          
          INT. GARBAGE DEPOT - SAME
          
          Eve lies in a seemingly endless WAREHOUSE OF TRASH.
          Trash, slime, and robot parts everywhere.
          Piles dumped from a variety of CEILING CHUTES.
          
          Eve looks down.
          COMPUTER MICE crawl over her.
          One of them has crawled over her REBOOT button.
          Switched her back on.
          
                                      EVE
                         Wall-E!
          
          A warning alarm sounds.
          Eve spots a PLATFORM, loaded with GIANT TRASH CUBES.
          It slides into an AIRLOCK.
          Inner shield doors lock and seal.
          
                                      SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                         Caution: Activating airlock
                         disposal...Activating airlock disposal.
          
          The exterior hatch flies open.
          The vacuum of space instantly sucks out the cubed trash.
          
          Eve begins to panic.
          Calls out again:
          
                                      EVE
                         Wall-E!
          
          Suddenly, her area is flooded in light.
          She flinches at the sight of
          
                                                            72.
          
          
          
          TWO GIANT COMPACTOR ROBOTS
          
          as they rumble up behind her.
          Headlights for eyes.
          They bear a slight resemblance to Wall-E.
          "WALL-A" emblazoned on their fronts.
          Each grab a ton of trash at once.
          Eve is swept up with the junk.
          Compact it. Spit it out...
          
          ...Eve now trapped in the side of a giant cube.
          
          Her cube is picked up.
          Transported to a waiting platform.
          Stacked with other massive cubes.
          Eve discovers...
          
          ...Wall-E trapped in the cube next to her.
          
                                       EVE
                        Wall-E!
          
          He groans.
          Not doing well.
          
          Again the alarms kick in.
          The platform slides on rails...
          ...across the safety line...
          ...into the airlock...
          ...the inner shield doors begin to close...
          
          INSIDE THE AIRLOCK
          
          Eve needs to act fast.
          Her gun arm stuck inside the cube.
          Struggles to activate it...
          ...It cocks.
          BLASTS herself free.
          Flies over to Wall-E.
          He's stuck deep in the cube...
          
          BACK IN THE GARBAGE DEPOT
          
          M-O suddenly drops from a ceiling chute.
          Lands in a pile of trash.
          Covered with filth.
          
                                     M-O
                        [Primal scream.]
          
          ON M-O'S DISPLAY POV
          
          Piles of trash everywhere.
          The airlock doors closing in the distance.
          
                                                                73.
          
          
          ZOOMS IN and locks on Wall-E.
          His screen reads: "FOREIGN CONTAMINANT".
          
                                       M-O
                                 (beeps)
                          [I have you now!]
          
          M-O speeds towards the airlock.
          
          ON EVE
          
          Tugs on Wall-E.
          Desperate to free him.
          He's slow to pull loose...
          
          ...THE GAP in the doors narrows...
          
          ...Eve's never going to make it...
          
          ON M-O
          
          Racing towards the doors.
          He's almost at the airlock...
          The doors SLAM tight against his roller arms.
          M-O is stuck.
          
          The exterior hatch opens:
          ...Eve yanks Wall-E free...
          ...The trash flies out into space...
          ...She flies against the force...
          ...Fights to reach M-O...
          ...Grabs onto his roller...
          
          INSIDE THE GARBAGE DEPOT
          
          The WALL-As notice M-O stuck in the door.
          Slam the EMERGENCY SHUT-OFF BUTTON for the airlock.
          The exterior hatch closes.
          
          Eve and Wall-E fall to the ground in a heap.
          Safe.
          M-O still stuck in the door.
          Shaking uncontrollably with fear.
          
                                       M-O
                          Whoa.
          
          MOMENTS LATER
          
          The WALL-As light up a SMALL WORK SPACE.
          Eve props Wall-E up against some trash.
          He's barely functioning.
          Fades in and out of consciousness.
          Just his red "warning" light flashes on his meter.
          
                                                       74.
          
          
          
                                     EVE
                               ("Stay awake.")
                        Wall-E...
          
          Eve gently opens his chest cavity.
          Examines the damage.
          Carefully pulls out his CIRCUIT BOARD.
          Charred. Shorting out.
          Irreparable.
          She flies off into the depot.
          Searches for a new circuit board.
          
          M-O dutifully cleaning Wall-E.
          Finishes up.
          His DISPLAY POV reads: "All clean."
          M-O closes up. Satisfied.
          Wall-E feebly offers his hand in gratitude.
          
                                          WALL-E
                                 (weak)
                        Wall-E.
          
          M-O stares at the filthy hand.
          Cleans it.
          Then shakes.
          
                                          M-O
                        M-O.
          
          They sit in awkward silence for a beat.
          
                                       WALL-E
                                 (Really?)
                        M-O?
          
                                          M-O
                        M-O.
          
                                       WALL-E
                                 (Got it.)
                        M-O.
          
          Eve returns with FOUND CIRCUIT BOARDS.
          Shows each one to Wall-E.
          Will any of these work?
          He shakes his head with a frail "no."
          
          Wall-E opens his compactor.
          Pulls out the plant.
          
                                      WALL-E
                               (weak)
                        Di...rec...tive.
          
                                                                   75.
          
          
          
          Eve holds the plant.
          Her "RETURN TO AXIOM SUPERIOR" flashes in her display.
          She considers it for a moment...
          ...then tosses the plant to the floor.
          I don't care about the plant anymore.
          She holds her hand out to him.
          
                                        EVE
                        Directive.
          
          Wall-E struggles to lift his hand to Eve's.
          He reaches out...
          
          ...and bats her hand away.
          
          Surprises Eve.
          Wall-E pushes past her.
          Crawls over to the discarded plant.
          Gives it back to Eve.
          
                                        WALL-E
                               (weak)
                        Errr.....
          
          Eve can't make out what he is saying.
          Wall-E fumbles around his box.
          Pulls out...
          ...the Zippo lighter.
          Lights it.
          Eve stares at the flame.
          
                                        EVE
                        Earth?
          
          Wall-E nods.
          
                                        WALL-E
                        Earth.
          
          He moves his binocular   eyes up and down.
          Like the time he fixed   his broken eye.
          You can fix me, Eve.
          With spare parts in my   truck.
          The truck that is back   on...
          
                                     EVE
                        Earth! Earth!
          
          Her eyes light up.
          She understands!
          No time to lose.
          She scoops him up...
          
                                                                   76.
          
          
          
                                         WALL-E
                          M-O?
          
                                         M-O
                                   ("I'm comin'!")
                          Wall-E!
          
          M-O rushes over to Wall-E.

          Hangs onto his IGLOO LATCH with his roller.
          Eve raises her gun arm...
          ...Blasts a HOLE IN THE CEILING.
          Takes off with the two of them.
          Up through the garbage chute.
          The WALL-As wave goodbye.
          
          
          INT. ROBOT SERVICE TUNNEL - NIGHT
          
          A steward moves down the hall.
          Siren wailing.
          Scans for rogue robots.
          Eve and Wall-E's "Warning" image on his display screen.
          He stops in front of...
          
          A YELLOW LINE
          
          painted haphazardly on the floor.
          Follows it to a STORAGE CLOSET door.
          
                                         STEWARD
                          Wrong.
          
          The steward opens the closet.
          Inside, a PAINT-BOT hides his head in the corner.
          The yellow line leads straight to his rear brush.
          The Steward apprehends him with his SUSPENSION BEAM.
          
          Suddenly, everything begins to shake.
          The steward looks around, confused.
          A JET ENGINE NOISE builds.
          Seems to be coming from...
          
          ...the hallway TRASH CHUTE.
          
          Eve, Wall-E & M-O burst out from it.
          The paint-bot recognizes Wall-E.
          Beeps the POYSC song.
          Our savior has arrived!
          The steward's alarm goes haywire.
          
          ON STEWARD'S POV DISPLAY
          
          He takes a snapshot:
          Eve, holding Wall-E, holding the plant...
          
                                                                 77.
          
          
          ...and Eve is aiming her gun straight at camera.
          
          ANGLE ON STORAGE CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER
          
          The terrified steward is thrown in.
          
                                     STEWARD
                        Please hold. We are currently having
                        technical difficul -- !
          
          Eve locks the door on him.
          The trio take off down the hall.
          The freed paint-bot gives chase.
          Cheers POYSC as he follows.
          Wall-E, only half-functioning, gets an idea.
          Presses his PLAY BUTTON.
          POYSC BLARES through the hallway.
          
          ON VARIOUS HALLWAYS
          
          REJECTS come out of hiding as they hear the music.
          Parade after Eve and Wall-E.
          Hum POYSC.
          All following the pied piper.
          
          ON SCREENS AROUND THE AXIOM
          
          Eve and Wall-E's "Wanted" image instantly circulates.
          Alarms sound.
          Alert screens pop up around the sleeping ship.

          It highlights Eve and Wall-E's location.
          Auto activates every steward on the Axiom.
          
          ON VARIOUS LOCATIONS ON THE AXIOM - NIGHT
          
          Stewards eject from their wall stations.
          Like ATMs jumping to life.
          Race in the direction of Eve.
          Carelessly knock over stray passengers in their way.
          
                                                                    78.

          BACK ON THE BRIDGE
          
          Auto watches the deck plan display.
          Monitors the progress of all the stewards.
          The CAMERA DROPS THROUGH THE FLOOR, down to...
          
          THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS
          
          The Captain, still trapped.
          Rams his hover chair against the locked elevator door.

                        The plant!
          
          The Captain's eyes light up.
          Glances down at the OPEN MANUAL on the floor.
          "Plant icon + Holo-detector icon = Earth"
          He is filled with renewed determination.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        (Laughs) We'll see who's powerless now.
          
          Lays flat in his chair.
          Floats under his VANITY CONSOLE like a grease monkey.
          Pulls off the underside panel.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Ah-Ha!
          
          Yanks out a bundle of wiring.
          Cross-connects two wires.
          The console powers up...
          
                                                                     79.
          
          
          
          
          INT. ROBOT SERVICE TUNNELS - NIGHT
          
          Eve zooms through the hallways.
          A BAND OF REJECTS track behind them.
          They reach an intersection when...
          
          ...The CAPTAIN'S FACE appears on holo-screens all around
          them.
          
                                     CAPTAIN (OVER INTERCOM)
                        Testing, testing... Is this thing on?
          
          ALL AROUND THE AXIOM
          
          All screens display the Captain's live feed.
          He's absolutely everywhere.
          A few stray passengers are still up.
          Watch their screens in confusion.
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT
          
          Auto watches the Captain on the holo-screen.
          Furiously tries to shut off the intercom.
          
          BACK ON EVE AND WALL-E
          
                                     CAPTAIN (OVER INTERCOM)
                        Psssst! Hey! Hey! This is the Captain I'm
                        locked in my room. Eve, Wall-E, bring the
                        plant to the Lido Deck. I'll have
                        activated the holo-detector. Now hurry!
                        Auto's probably going to cut me off --
          
          The screens all go dead.
          Eve and Wall-E look at each other with determination.
          They're about to continue on when...
          
          A WALL OF STEWARDS block their path.
          
                                    STEWARDS
                        Halt.
          
          Dozens of them stand in a row.
          Eve fires her gun. Destroys a steward.
          Another one quickly takes its place.
          Traps her arm with its SUSPENSION BEAM.
          She can't shoot.
          The stewards advance, when suddenly...
          
          ...the Rejects charge the stewards:
          
          ...The beautician-bot deflects rays with her mirrors...
          ...The vacu-bot sneezes dust in their faces...
          
                                                                      80.
          
          
          ...The defib-bot shocks them with her paddles...
          ...The umbrella-bot opens up...
          ...Shields the others from the attack...
          
          BEHIND THE UMBRELLA-BOT
          
          A weak Wall-E activates his welding beam.
          Shorts out the Massage-bot's ENERGY STRAIGHTJACKET.
          It goes berserk.
          Leaps at the entire army of Stewards.
          Robot parts fly everywhere.
          Eve and Wall-E can't watch the carnage.
          
          BACK IN THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS
          
          He sets Eve's CYLINDRICAL DEVICE on the floor behind him.
          It projects her stored memories.
          
          UP ON THE BRIDGE
          
          Auto watches steward blips disappear from his screen.
          A MESSAGE SCREEN pops up.
          It's the Captain.
          
          ...and he's holding the plant?
          
                                       CAPTAIN (ON SCREEN)
                          Ha, ha! Look what I got, Auto!
          
          Auto's single lens irises wide.
          
                                       AUTO
                          Not possible.
          
                                       CAPTAIN (ON SCREEN)
                          That's right! The plant! Oh, you want it?
                          Come and get it, Blinky!
          
                                      AUTO
                          No.
          
          
          INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - SAME
          
          The Captain   hovers in front of Eve's memory screen.
          It projects   a STILL IMAGE OF WALL-E HOLDING THE PLANT.
          The Captain   blocks the camera's view of Wall-E.
          Pretends to   be holding the projected plant himself.
          
                                      CAPTAIN
                          Ha ha!
          
          HEARS AUTO coming.
          Turns off the vid-com.
          
                                                                      81.
          
          
          Yanks his bundle of wires out of the wall.
          The room goes dark again.
          
          CLOSE ON CEILING
          
          The aperture opens.
          Auto lowers into the dark.
          Cautiously searches the empty room...
          
                                       AUTO
                          Captain? Captain...?
          
          ON AUTO'S POV
          
          PANS across the portraits of other captains...
          ...past our present Captain...
          ...The eyes in the portrait dart nervously...
          -- wait a minute.
          
          The Captain lunges at him.
          Grabs Auto by the steering wheel.
          Hangs onto it like Cap'n Ahab in a gale.
          His lower extremities of no use.
          
                                       AUTO
                          Let go. Let go.
          
          Auto panics.
          Zips back up through the hole in the ceiling.
          The Captain gets stuck between floors...
          
                                       CAPTAIN
                          What too heavy for ya, huh?!
          
          UP ON THE BRIDGE
          
          ...Auto tries to pull free.
          The Captain won't let go.
          Auto ends up yanking him through.
          The Captain rides Auto like a bucking bronco.
          Auto swings violently back and forth.
          
                                       CAPTAIN
                          You're not getting away from me, one-eye!
                          -- OOF! -- Is that all you got?!
          
          Gopher drops out of his pneumatic tube.
          Sees the Captain fighting Auto.
          Charges at the Captain...
          
          ...who kicks him straight out the window...
          
          ON LIDO DECK
          
                                                                      82.
          
          
          
          Gopher plummets...
          ...his SHADOW growing over the POOL...
          ...and smashes in a heap on the cement.
          The end.
          
          ON WALL-E AND EVE
          
          We PAN OVER the smoking wreckage of the stewards.
          The massage-bot floats above it all.
          Pants like a wild beast.
          One steward still twitches.
          The massage-bot crushes him with one blow.
          
          Eve grabs Wall-E and the plant.
          They take off for the Concourse Level.
          M-O and the Rejects follow behind.
          
          ON THE BRIDGE
          
                                        CAPTAIN
                           That's it!...A little closer!
                           Must..press...button.
          
          The Captain reaches his one free hand out for...
          ...the HOLO-DETECTOR BUTTON.
          
                                        CAPTAIN
                           Gotcha! Ha ha!
          
          His hand slams down hard on it.
          KLAXONS sound all over the ship.
          
          VARIOUS ANGLES AROUND THE AXIOM
          
          ...Floodlights kick on everywhere...
          ...The LIDO DECK POOLS automatically cover up...
          ...Stray PASSENGERS pause to take in the alarms...
          ...SPACE-LIFE PRESERVERS burst from their hover chairs...
          ...Inflate around their necks...
          ...GREEN LINES appear on the floors...
          ...SLEEPING PASSENGERS are involuntarily led out of their
          cabins...
          ...Every hover chair follows the illuminated lines...
          
          The procedure is completely automated.
          The passengers are all confused.
          Helpless to stop it.
          
          
          INT. LIDO DECK
          
          The passengers glide in by the thousands.
          Form concentric circles over the closed-up pools.
          Fill the multi-storied balconies on all sides.
          
                                                                   83.
          
          
          
          ON JOHN AND MARY
          
          They arrive together at the Lido Deck.
          Mary notices a group of toddlers scared and crying.
          A NANNY-BOT tries vainly to placate them.
          
                                      NANNY-BOT
                         Remain calm. Remain calm.
          
          CLOSE ON BRIDGE PLAZA
          
          The BNL LOGO on the floor rotates.
          A large cylindrical device rises from the stage...
          
          ...The ship's HOLO-DETECTOR.
          
          JUMBOTRONS activate on the dome.
          Show the bridge.
          Everyone can see the Captain wrestling Auto.
          He tries to speak to them during the fight:
          
                                      CAPTAIN
                                (strained; in command)
                         Ladies and Gentlemen! This is your
                         Captain speaking! We're having a slight
                         malfunction with the Autopilot! Please
                         remain calm!
          
          The passengers get caught up in the conflict.
          Treat it as if it were a televised fight.
          
          ON THE REAR OF THE DECK
          
          Eve and Wall-E fly out of the transport tunnel.
          Make a beeline for the holo-detector.
          Ready and waiting for the plant...
          
          ...almost there...
          
          ON BRIDGE
          
                                     AUTO
                         Enough.
          
          Auto furiously spins his wheel.
          Throws the Captain to the floor.
          The entire ship lists dangerously to one side.
          
          ON LIDO DECK
          
          Eve and Wall-E slam into the holo-detector's side.
          Wall-E drops the plant.
          It tumbles off the bridge plaza.
          Eve is forced to set Wall-E down.
          
                                                                    84.
          
          
          He clings to the holo-detector.
          She flies off to retrieve the plant.
          
          The hover chairs stay locked on their lines.
          Passengers all slip off their chairs.
          Their uniform color defaults back to RED.
          Slowly slide across the deck.
          And for the first time...
          ...all of humanity reaches out to one another.
          CLOSE UPS of hands holding hands.
          
          Everyone piles up on the listing side.
          The plant is buried underneath the mass of humanity.
          Eve searches desperately amongst them.
          
          ON JOHN & MARY
          
          They hang together off their chairs.
          CRYING TODDLERS just above them.
          The kiddies slip out of their hover rings.
          Mary GASPS in horror.
          Yells to John:
          
                                        MARY
                           John, get ready to have some kids!
          
          They purposefully let go of their chairs.
          Grab hands, forming a human chain.
          Catch the toddlers.
          All slide together down the Lido Deck.
          The TODDLERS GIGGLE the whole way down.
          They land at the bottom, next to Eve.
          
          An empty monorail car tips off the upper deck...
          ...lands on the pool level.
          It begins sliding down the Lido Deck.
          Smashes vacant hover chairs in its wake.
          
                                           MARY
                                  (Gasp)
                           LOOK OUT!
          
          Eve looks   up. Sees the Monorail sliding towards them.
          She stops   the car before it hits.
          Struggles   to hold it up.
          Can't let   it crush the passengers below her.
          
          ON BRIDGE
          
          Auto keeps the ship tilted.
          Glides over to the HOLO-DETECTOR BUTTON.
          Switches it off.
          
          ON LIDO DECK
          
                                                                       85.
          
          
          
          The holo-detector begins to lower back into the floor...
          Wall-E is still hanging onto it.
          Barely functioning.
          He uses all his strength...
          
          ...and wedges himself under the UPPER LIP of the detector.
          
          Stops it from disappearing into the floor.
          The pressure squeezes Wall-E into a box.
          
          ON BRIDGE
          
          The holo-detector button buzzes and flashes.
          Something's wrong.
          Auto calls up a LIDO DECK SECURITY CAMERA VIEW.
          Discovers Wall-E wedged in the device.
          
                                    AUTO
                           No.
          
          Auto presses down on the "off" button.
          
          ON WALL-E
          
          The holo-detector's hydraulics fight against him.
          Wall-E desperately fights to hold it up.
          Begins slowly to expand himself...
          
          ...and push the holo-detector back up!!
          
          ON BRIDGE
          
          The Captain watches Wall-E's heroic rise on screen.
          Auto flips out his TASER.
          Jams it into the "off" button.
          Short circuits it.
          
                                    CAPTAIN
                           NO!!
          
          BACK ON WALL-E
          
          The holo-detector reverses full force.
          Crushes Wall-E.
          We can't tell if he survived the crush.
          
          Eve calls out for him.
          Trapped, holding up the monorail car above the passengers.
          
          BACK ON BRIDGE
          
          The Captain watches Wall-E being crushed.
          That's it.
          He braces his arms against the floor...
          
                                                                 86.
          
          
          ...and rises up on HIS OWN TWO FEET...
          
          ON JUMBOTRON SCREEN
          
          The passengers collectively GASP.
          Their Captain is standing...
          ...and walking himself up the railing...
          ...towards Auto!
          They CHEER!
          
          ON BRIDGE
          
          Auto hears the distant cheering.
          Wonders what's up.
          
                                       CAPTAIN (O.S.)
                           Auto!
          
          Auto whips around.
          Shocked to see the Captain standing (albeit wobbly).
          Finds himself face to face with him.
          Auto flips out his TASER.
          Rushes at him.
          The Captain grabs it. They wrestle.
          The taser ARCS in the Captain's face.
          He flinches. Looks up.
          Sees a CONTROL PANEL high up on Auto's column...
          
          ...and smirks.
          
          The Captain looks Auto in the eye.
          Raises a finger up to the control panel...
          ...to the "AUTOPILOT" BUTTON...
          ...and flicks the switch to "MANUAL".
          
                                        CAPTAIN
                                  (grits his teeth)
                           Auto, you are relieved of duty.
          
                                       AUTO
                           Noo --
          
          Auto is instantly turned off.
          The Captain smiles triumphantly.
          Grabs the wheel with both hands.
          Makes the ship level again.
          
          ON LIDO DECK
          
          The passengers all spill across the deck.
          Shaken but OK.
          Eve sets the monorail down.
          Rockets over to the holo-detector.
          
                                                                     87.
          
          
          
          Wall-E is pinned under the lip of the holo-detector.
          Eve tries to lift it up.
          It won't budge.
          She looks back to the crowd.
          
                                     EVE
                        PLANT! PLANT!
          
          ON M-O
          
          He searches the crowd for the plant.
          Humans begin to stand for the first time all around him.
          Through his POV he spots the plant mixed in among them.
          "FOREIGN CONTAMINANT" flashes on his display screen.
          
          ON EVE
          
          She fights to keep the machine from crushing Wall-E further.
          
                                      M-O (O.S.)
                        Ee-vah!
          
          M-O holds the plant up from across the Lido Deck.
          The vacu-bot shoots it into the hands of a passenger.
          Humans and robots form an impromptu fire line.
          Toss it up to Eve on stage.
          She shoves the plant into the device.
          The detector instantly scans the plant.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        Plant origin verified. Course set for
                        Earth.
          
          Slowly, the holo-detector rises...
          Wall-E topples out from underneath.
          Badly crushed and leaking oil.
          Eve GASPS in horror.
          M-O and the Rejects avert their eyes.
          Passengers recoil as well.
          
          WIDE ON DOME CEILING
          
          It converts into a GIANT STAR CHART.
          Rapidly plots a course for Earth.

          Eve lifts Wall-E up.
          No sign of life.
          
                                      EVE
                        No! WALL-E!!
          
                                                                    88.
          
          
          
          M-O's head drops in despair.
          The passengers witness grief for the first time.
          Begin to have new feelings of their own: sadness, sympathy.
          Mary begins to cry.
          Buries her head in John's shoulder.
          
                                        MARY

          The ship jumps to light speed.
          
          BACK INSIDE
          
          The passengers and robots are thrown off their feet.
          Everyone holds on to one another.
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE
          
          The Captain struggles to keep control of the steering wheel.
          Fights the G-forces.
          
          
          INT. LIDO DECK
          
          Humans and robots hang on for dear life.
          John and Mary cling to each other and the babies.
          
          ON EVE
          
          She holds tightly to Wall-E.
          Still calling out his name.
          No response.
          
          ON SPACE
          
          The Axiom zooms through hyperspace.
          
          
          EXT. EARTH - HILLSIDE - DAY
          
          The cockroach waits obediently on the hill.
          Exactly where Wall-E told him to stay.
          His antennae twitch with boredom.
          
                                                                     89.
          
          
          
          A RED DOT
          
          appears on the ground.
          The cockroach watches the dot run down the hillside.
          The ground begins to shake.
          Daylight dims.
          The insect looks to the sky.
          
          ON CLOUD COVER
          
          A DARK PATCH grows behind the clouds.
          Blots out the sunlight.
          The Axiom's keel breaks through.
          Its shadow swallows up the entire landscape.
          
          The cockroach senses his master's return.
          HUNDREDS OF RED DOTS rush past him.
          He eagerly chases after them.
          
          ON AXIOM
          
          The city-size starliner lowers gracefully from the sky.
          Pushes back the clouds to the horizon.
          
          
          EXT. OPPOSITE SIDE OF BAY - AXIOM PORT
          
          The CIRCLE OF DOTS triangulate over the abandoned berth.
          Converge over the port's LANDING SHAFT.
          Thousands of feet deep.
          The ship's keel descends into it.
          The earth shudders.
          Trash towers tumble in the distance.
          
          ...Then all is quiet.
          
          ON BELLY OF THE AXIOM
          
          A ROW OF GIANT DOORS open on the side of the ship.
          MULTIPLE GANGWAYS automatically extend.
          Connect with BUILT-IN TERMINALS on the port.
          
          The Captain walks out gingerly.
          Holding the boot w/ plant.
          The other passengers step out on their own legs.
          Wobble like toddlers.
          They squint up at the harsh sunlight.
          A commotion is heard from the back.
          Somebody trying to push through.
          
          EVE
          
          appears out of the crowd.
          Cradles a BOXED UP WALL-E in her arms.
          
                                                                      90.
          
          
          M-O and the Rejects follow behind her.
          They rush across the gangway.
          
          The cockroach meets up with Eve.
          Climbs up onto Wall-E.
          Doesn't understand why his master isn't responding.
          Eve urgently scans the landscape.
          Locks on to WALL-E'S TRUCK in the distance.
          She takes to the air.
          M-O and the Rejects chase after her down the gangway.
          
                                     M-O
                               (beeps)
                        [Eve! Wait!]
          
          The Captain respectfully removes his hat.
          Good luck, friend.
          
          
          INT. WALL-E'S TRUCK
          
          The interior is dark and still.
          Suddenly the junk jingles and clinks as the back door opens.
          Eve flies inside with Wall-E.
          Sets him on the floor.
          
          She scans the rotating shelves at high speed.
          Grabs a CAR JACK.
          Ratchets up Wall-E's crushed body...
          
          QUICK SHOTS
          
          ...SPARE PARTS being grabbed by Eve...
          ...Frantically installs the new parts into Wall-E...
          ...Her arms a blur of precision in motion...
          ...Replaces his damaged CIRCUIT BOARD. The final piece...
          ...She opens his new solar panels...
          
          ...and BLASTS a hole in the ceiling with her gun.
          
          OUT ON THE EMPTY BAY
          
          The rejects stop.
          See the roof of Wall-E's truck explode.
          Oh no.
          
          BACK IN THE TRUCK
          
          A shaft of sunlight beams down on Wall-E.
          Eve holds her breath, watches...
          Waits...
          
          ...Beep...
          ...Beep...

                        (Apple "reboot" SFX)
          
          Wall-E's meter fully charges.
          His head slowly rises from his box.
          Blinks.
          The cockroach hops with joy.
          Eve is relieved.
          
          ...She holds out her hand to him.
          
                                     EVE
                               (with love)
                        Wall-E...
          
          Wall-E gives her a blank stare.
          He turns away from Eve. Motors out the truck.
          She grabs him.
          Turns him back around.
          
                                       EVE
                                 (It's me!)
                        Eve!
          
          Wall-E just stares.
          Doesn't seem to know who she is.
          
                                      EVE

                        [Here, look at these.]
          
          She grabs the RUBIK'S CUBE and LIGHT BULB from the shelf.
          The light bulb glows in her hand.
          She gives them to Wall-E.
          No reaction.
          
                                       EVE

                        Wall-E?
          
          Wall-E looks blankly at the junk on the shelves.
          
                                        EVE
                               (hums)
                        [I know!]
          
          She hovers over to the video player.
          Plays HELLO DOLLY.
          Looks back to see if it has any effect.
          
          Wall-E is over at the shelves.
          Has scooped all his prized possessions into his compactor.
          Crushes them into a cube.
          Eve is gut-punched.
          
                                                                 92.
          
          
          Wall-E motors outside.
          Runs over the cockroach on his way out.
          The insect pops back to life.
          Watches his friend in shock.
          
          
          EXT. WALL-E'S TRUCK - DAY
          
          Wall-E rolls up to a nearby trash pile.
          Scoops up trash. Spits out a cube.
          Eve hovers over to him.
          Still in disbelief.
          
                                    EVE
                              (somber)
                        No.
          
          Wall-E continues to stack his cubes.
          She stops him.
          Lifts his head. Stares into his eyes.
          Nobody home.
          Eve presses his "play" button.
          Nothing but STATIC.
          Eve begins to panic.
          Shakes him.
          
                                     EVE
                        Wall-E...Wall-E! WALL-E!
          
          No response.
          He's gone.
          She hovers in silence next to him for a long time...
          
          Finally, Eve grasps Wall-E's hand.
          Forces his fingers to interlace with hers.
          Holds him close one last time.
          Leans her head against his.
          Hums softly.

          She touches her forehead to his.
          Goodbye Wall-E.
          A TINY SPARK between them.
          
          Eve turns to hover away.
          Jerked back.
          Her fingers caught between his.
          She checks his eyes again.
          Nothing.
          
          But then...
          
                                                                   93.
          
          
          ...a tiny SERVO NOISE.
          She looks down at their hands.
          
          CLOSE ON WALL-E'S FINGERS
          
          They start to move.
          Slowly close around Eve's.
          
          She looks back at his face.
          Wall-E's eyes gradually come into focus.
          His brows raise...
          
                                       WALL-E
                         Ee-vah?
          
                                       EVE
                         Wall-E!
          
          He notices their hands entwined.
          His dream come true.
          
                                      WALL-E
                                (amazed)
                         Ee-vah!!
          
          She giggles.
          
          INSIDE THE TRUCK
          
          The "Hello Dolly" tape reaches the finale of IOTAM.
          
          "And that is all that love's about..."
          
          BACK OUTSIDE
          
          Eve and Wall-E stare into each other's eyes.
          M-O and the Rejects finally reach the truck.
          They begin to celebrate.
          Wall-E's alive!
          Then M-O realizes they need privacy.
          Herds the Rejects O.S.

                         Go! Go, go go!
          
          Wall-E and Eve's foreheads touch.
          Together now and ever more.
          
          "...and we'll recall when time runs out..."

               "Medical journals report only 31 cases in history of people 
               swallowing their toothbrushes. The champion toothbrush 
               swallower was a Soviet psychiatric patient who downed 16 in 
               1984. The all-time champion swallower of any object swallowed

               ECU: A TOOTHBRUSH - CREDITS ROLLING

               We HEAR a man clearing his throat. He enters and a shiny 
               glob of toothpaste is squeezed onto the bristles.

               INT. BOB WILEY'S BATHROOM, MORNING

               BOB WILEY, thirties, anxious, begins brushing his teeth. 
               Suddenly, in trying to brush a back molar, Bob looses control 
               of the toothbrush and swallows half of it whole. Choking, 
               gasping, he tries to pull the toothbrush out.

               EXT. BOB WILEY'S APARTMENT BUILDING, SAME

               PAN and TILT up from a woman walking her dog on the streets 
               of Manhattan to a third floor apartment window. There is Bob 
               struggling frantically with the toothbrush.

               INT. BOB WILEY'S BATHROOM, MORNING

               Bob is losing the battle, and in three excruciating swallows, 
               like a mouse going down the throat of a snake, the toothbrush 
               disappears down his throat. Bob pounds his chest, swallowing 
               as he does. Then, delicately, he belches. He takes a deep 
               breath, relaxes somewhat, and opens the medicine cabinet. 
               There sit ten packaged toothbrushes. Bob opens one.

               Four psychiatrists and three spouses are pleasure boating. 
               Here all is quiet except the wind and the sound of the birds 
               (or is it the car alarms?). Shrinks and their wives sit around 
               an intense doctor in his forties.

                         I'm leaving my office for summer

               Dr. Feinberg exits the building with his suitcase. To his 
               horror an angry horde of men and women, looking like a 
               sadistic lynch mob, swarm him and attack.

                                     FEINBERG (V.O.)
                         "Don't leave us!" they scream. Then 
                         they beat me and bite me and kill 
                         me...!

               As Feinberg runs to get away he is dragged down then overrun 
               by his angry patients.

               of New York, CRANING and ZOOMING like a bird up and into a

               Bob Wiley sits on his bed in boxer shorts. On his night stand 
               are cardboard plaques: one lists the warning signs of 
               diabetes, another lists cancer's seven warning signals. 
               Stacked by the bed are psychology books and a few bottles of 
               prescription pills. In front of Bob is a vaporizer. Bob holds 
               his cheeks and twists them in small circles in front of the 
               steam.

               INT. A PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE, DAY

               The striking thing about DR. LEO MARVIN's office is order 
               and neatness. As Marvin talks on the phone, he unconsciously 
               adjusts the already meticulously placed gewgaws on his desk. 
               Marvin is mid-forties, authoritative, stiff, perfectly 
               manicured. Adorning the office are diplomas, personal 
               mementos, primitive masks, Mondrian-like paintings, his framed 
               medical school grades, a bust of Freud, and diplomas. On his 
               desk is a book titled Baby Steps TM with Marvin's picture on 
               it.

                         book, Hugo and it's a wonderful 
                         opportunity, but its my vacation. 
                         The Today Show went to Dr. Ruth's 
                         vacation house, why can't CBS Morning

                         you work on it?... Thank you Hugo. I

                         Fensterwald. Carswell Fensterwald. 
                         It sounds familiar but... They sure 
                         come out of the woodwork when you 
                         get famous, Clair. Put him through.

               Carswell Fensterwald looks unstable. As he talks on his phone, 
               he is boxing up his office. Prominent on his desk is a copy 
               of Marvin's book. The conversation INTERCUTS.

                                     FENSTERWALD
                         Long time no see, huh? You have a 
                         big book out. Things are clicking, 
                         huh?

                                     MARVIN
                         That's the way I planned it.

                                     FENSTERWALD
                         Listen, Leo, I'm closing my practice. 
                         Most of my patients are on the West 
                         Side but I have one case I'd like to 
                         refer you.

                                     FENSTERWALD
                         I know, you're incredibly busy.

                                     MARVIN
                         Swamped. I've raised my rate. I might 
                         even cut my sessions to forty 
                         minutes...

                                     FENSTERWALD
                         Leo, I know you don't like flattery 
                         but if anybody I know is going to 
                         win a Nobel Prize, it's you. You 
                         gotta be thinking about your next 
                         book so I know you'll find this case 
                         particularly interesting.

                                     MARVIN
                         What sort of case is it, Carswell?

               Marvin paces. He adjusts a diploma down, then up, then down.

                                     FENSTERWALD
                         Actually, Leo, I don't know.

                                     MARVIN
                         Carswell, if this is a dysfunctional --

                                     FENSTERWALD
                         No no, nothing like that. He keeps 
                         his appointments. Pays on time. See 
                         him once. If he's not the most complex 
                         and -- persistent -- case you've 
                         ever seen, drop him. His name's Bob 
                         Wiley. He needs someone brilliant.

                                     MARVIN
                         Okay. I'll work him in for an 
                         interview. Say, Carswell, how come 
                         you're quitting the business?

                                     FENSTERWALD
                         We're a dying breed, Leo. Good luck.

               Fensterwald hangs up. He lets out a silent jubilant howl of 
               gleeful laughter.

                                     FENSTERWALD
                         I feel good. I feel great. I feel 
                         wonderful!

               ANGLE IN MARVIN'S OFFICE

               Marvin slowly hangs up his speaker phone.

                                     MARVIN
                         Carswell Fensterwald...?

               Again he racks his brains. He presses his intercom.

                                     MARVIN
                              (INTO INTERCOM)
                         Claire, if I get a call from a Bob 
                         Wiley, schedule him for a short 
                         interview after vacation.

                                     SECRETARY (CLAIRE)
                         He's already called, Dr. Marvin. 
                         Twice. He's coming in this afternoon.

                                     MARVIN
                         That's one kind of persistence. 
                         Carswell Fensterwald...?

               Marvin gives up. He picks up a copy of his book. He compares 
               his jacket photo with his reflection in the handle of his 
               letter opener.

               EXT. ABOARD THE CRIS CRAFT BOAT, DAY

               The shrinks are still listening to Doctor 3.

                                     FEINBERG
                         Leo Marvin. Now I remember. An 
                         incredible asshole.

                                     DOCTOR 2
                         Had that stupid best seller, what 
                         was the name of it?

                                     FEINBERG
                         Watching grass grow was more exciting 
                         than Leo Marvin.

                                     PHIL
                         All that changed.

                                     DOCTOR 2 (V.O.)
                         Why?

                                     PHIL (V.O.)
                         That's what I'm trying to tell you 
                         lummoxes: Bob.

               INT. BOB'S APARTMENT, DAY

               Bob is sitting by the steam repeating his mantra.

                                     BOB
                         I feel good. I feel great. I feel 
                         wonderful! I feel good, I feel great! 
                         I feel --

               Bob picks up the phone and frantically pushes buttons.

                                     BOB
                              (INTO PHONE)
                         Hello, Claire, Bob again. Are you 
                         sure Dr. Marvin doesn't have an 
                         earlier cancellation?... Sorry. See 
                         you at two, sharp.

               Bob hangs up, finds a blood pressure gauge and takes his 
               blood pressure. That done, he stands, paces, then stops and 
               sprinkles food into a gold fish bowl.

                                     BOB
                         Morning, Gil.

               GIL the GOLDFISH nibbles the food. Bob sits on his bed, takes 
               a deep breath, then dials the phone. As he waits for an 
               answer, he flips through his "organizer" which is crammed 
               with notes and papers.

                                     SECRETARY'S VOICE
                              (ON PHONE)
                         Overton.

                                     BOB
                              (INTO HEADSET)
                         This is Bob Wiley calling...
                              (checks in his notebook)
                         Mrs. Patricia Lions please.

               Bob waits a beat, still looking through the notebook.

                                     MRS. LIONS
                              (ON PHONE)
                         Lions.

                                     BOB
                         Mrs. Lions, I'm Bob Wiley. I represent 
                         the Manhattan Dental Hygiene 
                         Association. I can offer you a forty 
                         percent discount on our toothpicks 
                         plus a very attractive selection of

                         Mr. Wiley --

                                     BOB
                         Bob.

                                     MRS. LIONS
                         Bob, this is an elementary school.

                                     BOB
                         Elementary school?
                              (checks his notebook)
                         I thought you were Overton Cafeteria?

                                     MRS. LIONS
                              (ON PHONE)
                         No, we're a school and we don't need 
                         toothpicks.

                                     BOB
                         I don't know. A young tooth is a 
                         terrible thing to waste. I should 
                         know. When I was that age nobody 
                         gave a hoot about my teeth and now 
                         they're terrible! Have you checked 
                         out flavored floss?

                                     MRS. LIONS
                         Flavored floss?

                                     BOB
                         All you have to do is dream pink 
                         gums, Patsy, and we can make them 
                         happen. Give me your address and 
                         I'll send you our flossing catalogue.

               As Bob begins to write on his notebook, he flashes a "V" for 
               victory at Gil.

               INT. BOB'S APARTMENT, LATER

               Bob is now dressed to go out. A clock reads 1:45pm. Bob is 
               pacing at the door. He stops, glances at the clock, faces 
               the door, opens it, closes it. He paces, opens the door, 
               takes some deep breaths, twists his cheeks, then like a man 
               jumping into cold water, bolts out.

               INT. THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE BOB'S APARTMENT, SAME

               Bob exits his apartment, uses a Kleenex to close the door, 
               then heads down the stairs.

               EXT. THE DOORWAY TO BOB'S APARTMENT BUILDING, DAY

               Sweat pouring off his brow, Bob stands in sunglasses in the 
               entrance-way to his apartment. A bus squeals up to the curb, 
               belches smoke, then moves on. A garbage can is kicked over. 
               Bob starts to take a step when suddenly he gets dizzy. He 
               steps back and hyperventilates. Bob puts on a dust mask, 
               steps bravely onto the sidewalk, and walks, eyes fixed 
               forward.

                                     BOB
                         I feel good, I feel great, I feel 
                         wonderful.
                              (repeats)

               A man passes Bob, eyes fixed forward.

                                     MAN
                         Son of a bitch, dirty bastard, I'll 
                         get you!
                              (repeats)

               EXT. THE STREETS OF MANHATTAN, DAY. LONG SHOT

               Bob walks through the city like a zombie, eyes fixed forward.

               INT. AN OFFICE BUILDING LOBBY, MANHATTAN, SAME

               Passers-by shuffle to and fro. Bob, still in sunglasses and 
               dust mask, enters. He walks in a straight line to the building 
               directory. He finds:

                 "Dr. Leo Marvin, A Psychiatric Corporation, suite 4616."

                                     DOORMAN (O.S.)
                         Help you?

               This startles Bob but he recovers.

                                     BOB
                         I'm going to see Dr. Leo Marvin.

                                     DOORMAN
                         Second elevator. 46th floor.

                                     BOB
                         Elevator. Thanks.

               ANGLE ON THE ELEVATORS

               Bob removes a Kleenex from a pack in his pocket, uses it to 
               push the elevator button, then paces nervously. The elevator 
               arrives and the door opens. The elevator is filling up with 
               passengers. Bob doesn't move.

               INT. A STEEL AND CONCRETE STAIRWELL, SAME

               We see a descending steel staircase and stairwell door marked 
               "Floor 40". We hear footsteps -- rhythmic and determined -- 
               getting closer and closer.

                                     BOB (O.S.)
                         I feel good, I feel great, I feel 
                         wonderful.
                              (repeats over and 
                              over)

               INT. DR. MARVIN'S RECEPTION ROOM, DAY

               Clair sits behind her desk reading a book. Bob enters, red-
               faced and out of breath, taking his pulse.

                                     BOB
                         Hi... I'm... Bob...

               INT. DR. MARVIN'S OFFICE, DAY

               Dr. Marvin is at his desk. Claire shows in Bob.

                                     BOB
                         Dr. Marvin. Bob Wiley. Thank you for 
                         working me in.

               Claire exits. Bob looks around then notices a framed photo 
               on Marvin's shelf. Using his Kleenex, Bob picks it up. He 
               smiles.

                                     BOB
                         Your family?
                              (Marvin nods)
                         Wait, let me guess. I'm good at this. 
                         Harriet, Kenny, Gretchen, Rita. Wait 
                         wait, I know I'm close. Susan, Steven, 
                         Andrea, Rita. Wait --

                                     MARVIN
                              (emotionless)
                         My wife, Fay. My son, Sigmund. My 
                         daughter, Anna. My sister, Lily.

                                     BOB
                         Lily... I was close! What a wonderful 
                         family!

               Bob puts the photo back on the shelf. Marvin adjusts it.

                                     MARVIN
                         Thank you.

                                     BOB
                         Do I call you Dr. Marvin or Leo?

                                     MARVIN
                         Whichever you prefer. Have a seat.

                                     BOB
                         Call me Bob.

               Bob stares at the chair. There is a box of Kleenexes on the 
               arm. Bob reaches in his pocket, takes out a Kleenex, and 
               uses it to move the box of Kleenexes to the table. He then 
               sits. Marvin walks to Bob and holds out a trash can. Bob 
               drops in the used Kleenex.

                                     BOB
                         Thank you.

               Marvin puts the trash can next to Bob's chair then sits. He 
               stares at Bob. He's waiting.

                                     BOB
                         I guess I'm on, huh?
                              (pause)
                         Well, the simplest way to put it is, 
                         I have problems. I worry er, about 
                         diseases. I have trouble with 
                         toothbrushes. And I, er, I have 
                         problems moving.

                                     MARVIN
                         Talk about moving.

                                     BOB
                         As long as I'm in my apartment, I'm 
                         okay. I have a phone job -- selling 
                         dental supplies -- and that's fine. 
                         But when I have to go out, I get..., 
                         weird.

                                     MARVIN
                         Talk about weird.

                                     BOB
                         I get dizzy spells. Nausea. Cold 
                         sweats. Hot sweats. Fever blisters. 
                         Difficulty swallowing. Difficulty 
                         breathing. Blurred vision. Involuntary 
                         trembling. Dead hands. Weak ankles. 
                         Twitching. Fainting spells. Numb 
                         lips.
                              (pause)
                         Do you think that's normal?

                                     MARVIN
                         That depends.

               Suddenly Bob removes an air sickness bag from his pocket. He 
               opens it and pauses a long time as though he were about to 
               vomit into it. He doesn't. He puts the air sickness bag away. 
               Marvin leans in. Bob does too.

                                     MARVIN
                         You do go out, you know.

                                     BOB
                         I do?

                                     MARVIN
                         You came here.

                                     BOB
                         You're right!

                                     MARVIN
                         What are you afraid of?

                                     BOB
                         Well. What if I break my neck and 
                         become paraplegic? What if my heart 
                         stops beating, or I can't find a 
                         bathroom and my bladder explodes? 
                         You ever heard of Tourette's Syndrome. 
                         You know, where you involuntarily 
                         shout profanity?

                                     MARVIN
                         That's exceptionally rare.

                                     BOB
                         I have a neighbor who got it. Yells 
                         "oh shit!" in church. "Douche bag!" 
                         at customers at his job. Pretty funny, 
                         actually, unless you're the one with 
                         the disease. Then it's sad.
                              (pause)
                         OH SHIT EATING SON OF A BITCH! Just 
                         kidding.
                              (pause)
                         TWAT LOVING DOUCHE BAG!

                                     MARVIN
                         Why are you doing this?

                                     BOB
                         Sometimes, if I fake it, I know I 
                         don't have it. Like, when I think my 
                         heart is gonna stop. I fake it so I 
                         know it's not happening.

               Bob fakes a heart seizure -- very convincingly -- and falls 
               to the floor. After a moment, he sits back in the chair as 
               if nothing had happened.

                                     BOB
                         If I can't make it happen, I know 
                         it's not happening. I know it's all 
                         in my mind.

               Marvin stands and walks towards Bob.

                                     BOB
                         Get away from me with that knife!
                              (laughs)
                         See?

               Marvin uprights the trashcan and walks back to his seat.

                                     MARVIN
                         Are you married?

                                     BOB
                         Divorced, actually.

                                     MARVIN
                         Want to talk about it?

                                     BOB
                         The world is divided into two types 
                         of people: those who like Neil Diamond 
                         and those who don't. My ex-wife loves 
                         him.

                                     MARVIN
                         Um.

                                     BOB
                         Dr. Marvin, do you think you can 
                         help me?

               There is a pause. Marvin leans in.

                                     MARVIN
                         There's a saying, Bob, that the best 
                         psychiatrist in the world is right 
                         inside of you. I can help you, 
                         provided you're willing to help 
                         yourself.

                                     BOB
                         Are you kidding, I'll do anything!

               Marvin stands and moves to the bookcase behind him.

                                     MARVIN
                         There's a ground breaking book that 
                         just came out, Bob. Not everything 
                         in it applies to you but when you 
                         see the title, I think you'll see 
                         that it can help.

               There are twenty copies of Marvin's book on the shelf behind 
               Marvin. Marvin holds one up. Bob sees the cover. We see the 
               picture of Marvin on the back.

                                     BOB
                         Baby Steps.

                                     MARVIN
                         It means setting small, reasonable 
                         goals for yourself. One day at a 
                         time, one tiny step at a time -- do-
                         able, accomplishable goals.

                                     BOB
                         Baby steps.

                                     MARVIN
                         When you leave this office, don't 
                         think about everything you have to 
                         do to get out of the building, just 
                         deal with getting out of the room. 
                         When you reach the hall, just deal 
                         with the hall. And so forth. Baby 
                         steps.

               Bob looks at Marvin then stands.

                                     BOB
                         Baby step... through the office.

               Bob takes small deliberate steps to the door. He opens it 
               and steps into the reception area.

                                     BOB (O.S.)
                         Baby step... out the door.

               The door to the office closes. There is a long pause. Bob 
               opens the door and pops back in.

                                     BOB
                         It works!

                                     MARVIN
                         Of course.

                                     BOB
                         All I have to do is take one small 
                         step at a time and I can do anything!

                                     MARVIN
                         Exactly. But don't expect everything 
                         all at once. Even a baby occasionally 
                         falls and hits his head.

               Bob walks around the room as though he were inhabiting each 
               small space with his body.

                                     BOB
                         Baby step around the office. Baby 
                         step around the office!
                              (to Marvin's family 
                              photo)
                         Fay, Sigmund, Anna, Lily: Hi fam! 
                         He's a genius!

               Marvin hands Bob the book.

                                     MARVIN
                         This will give you plenty to digest 
                         while I'm on vacation.

                                     BOB
                         Vacation?

                                     MARVIN
                         Certainly my secretary told you. As 
                         of this afternoon, I'm on vacation 
                         with my family until Labor Day.

                                     BOB
                         That's a whole month! What if I need 
                         you? What if I need to talk?

                                     MARVIN
                         Dr. Harmon, my associate will be 
                         happy to talk.

               He hands Bob Harmon's card.

                                     MARVIN
                         We have years ahead of us, Bob. A 
                         month will seem like a baby second.

               Marvin shows Bob the door. Bob, doing his baby steps, looks 
               lost and confused.

                                     BOB
                         Can I call you in the Hamptons if I 
                         need you?

                                     MARVIN
                         Dr. Harmon is quite skilled.

               Bob shuffles to the door.

                                     BOB
                         I hear Maine is great this time of 
                         year.

               Marvin turns over his book and shows Bob his picture.

                                     MARVIN
                         I'll be with you the whole month. 
                         Try your baby steps.

                                     BOB
                         Let's see... Baby step through the 
                         office. Baby step out the door.

                                     MARVIN
                         That's perfect. Keep going...

                                     BOB (O.S.)
                         Baby steps to the hall. Baby...

               Marvin closes the door and starts back to his desk. 
               Momentarily, Bob sticks his head back in.

                                     BOB
                         It's the Catskills, isn't it?

                                     MARVIN
                         Bob...

                                     BOB
                         Sorry. Baby steps. Baby steps...

               Bob exits, closing the door. Marvin starts to pick up Bob's 
               trash can when Bob sticks his head in again.

                                     BOB
                         You flying or driving?

                                     MARVIN
                         Bob.
                              (firmly re-assuring)
                         I'll be back.

               Bob looks at Marvin then starts out.

                                     BOB
                         Baby steps, he'll be back. Baby steps, 
                         he'll be back...

               Bob closes the door behind him. From his desk Marvin takes a 
               plastic trash bag and dumps the contents of Bob's trash can 
               into it. He picks up a small tape recorder and presses

                         July 31, Bob Wiley, introductory 
                         interview. Multi-phobic personality 
                         characterized by an extreme need for 
                         family connections. Bill $150 for 
                         the session and $29.95 for the book.

               He clicks the tape recorder off. There is a knock on the 
               door.

                                     MARVIN
                         Bob...

               Claire puts her head in.

                                     CLAIRE
                         It's your publicist. He says CBS 
                         will come to Winnipesaukee.

               Marvin strides triumphantly to the phone and lifts it up.

                                     MARVIN
                              (INTO PHONE)
                         I knew they'd come to me! Hugo, not 
                         to change the subject but has a 
                         psychiatrist ever won the Nobel Prize?

               INT. THE HALLWAY OF MARVIN'S OFFICE BUILDING, SAME

               Bob paces in front of the elevators, reading the book.

                                     BOB
                         Baby step to the elevator. Baby step 
                         to the elevator.

               The elevator, full of passengers, opens. Bob, steps in.

                                     BOB
                         Baby step to the elevator. Baby step 
                         to the elevator.

               The elevator doors close and it starts down. Bob screams.

               EXT. THE NEW YORK MARINE AIR TERMINAL, DAY

               Marvin and family (who we recognize from the pictures in 
               Marvin's office) exit a cab with their luggage and head into 
               the terminal.

                                     MARVIN
                         Hurry hurry hurry. Hurry hurry hurry. 
                         Hurry hurry hurry.

               They pass a HOMELESS MAN with a hand out. Marvin's wife FAY 
               stops and roots in her purse.

                                     MARVIN
                         Honey there isn't time.

               Fay gives the man some money then enters the terminal.

                                     MARVIN
                         You're only encouraging them, Fay.

               INT. THE MARINE AIR TERMINAL, SAME

               The Marvin family hurries through the terminal.

                                     MARVIN
                         Hurry hurry hurry. Hurry hurry 
                         hurry...

               Marvin's 16 year old daughter ANNA and 12 year old son SIGMUND 
               rush with them.

                                     ANNA
                         Daddy, would you cut it out?

               The family finds their gate and gets in line to board. There 
               are ten people ahead of them and the plane isn't boarding 
               yet. All haste stops as they drop their luggage to the floor.

                                     ANNA
                         See?

                                     FAY
                         Honey, I told you there was no rush.

               A nice looking BOY gets in line behind them and checks out 
               Anna. She sees him and flips her hair. Siggy, dressed in all 
               black, plays a video game on his watch. It beeps and blurps. 
               FAY lovingly plucks a piece of lint off Marvin's jacket. 
               Siggy looks up and plucks off another piece of lint. Marvin 
               takes out an electronic organizer. He pushes buttons and it 
               beeps.

                                     MARVIN
                         Okay, how does this sound? Tomorrow: 
                         we'll go shopping and clean up the 
                         house.

                                     SIGGY
                         Ooo, sounds great.

                                     MARVIN
                         Wednesday we'll re-arrange the 
                         furniture and spruce up the lawn.

                                     SIGGY
                         More, I gotta have more.

                                     MARVIN
                         Thursday...

               Marvin clears his throat and smiles.

                                     FAY, ANNA, SIGGY
                              (sing song)
                         The interview with Maria Shriver.

                                     MARVIN
                              (swelling with pride)
                         I'm having some art brought up from 
                         the city. The cottage should look 
                         spectacular.

               Fay kisses Marvin on the cheek.

                                     FAY
                         I'm sure whatever you do will look 
                         wonderful, honey.

               Marvin beams then goes back to his organizer.

                                     MARVIN
                         After the interview we'll take a 
                         celebration sail around lake, then 
                         Friday -- my birthday -- we'll have 
                         wonderful meal at Digby's.

               Fay straightens Siggy's shirt tail. Momentarily, Siggy's 
               watch lets out a staccato series of beeps.

                                     MARVIN
                         Siggy, are you going to spend all 
                         summer driving us crazy with that?

                                     SIGGY
                         It's not driving me crazy.

                                     ANNA
                         Me either.

               Siggy continues his game. Fay touches Marvin on the hand to 
               say, let it pass. Anna continues to flirt with the boy in 
               line. Marvin pushes a couple of buttons on his organizer and 
               it lets out three rapid beeps. Siggy smiles triumphantly at 
               Marvin.

                                     SIGGY
                         You gonna do that all summer?

               Marvin ignores this and puts the organizer away.

                                     ANNA
                         Yeah, dad, huh?

                                     MARVIN
                         Anna you're masking hostility.

               Marvin reaches in his briefcase and removes two HAND PUPPETS. 
               One has the silk screened face of Anna, the other of Leo. 
               Anna sees this and is incredibly embarrassed.

                                     ANNA
                              (intense)
                         Daddy, put those away!

               The line moves. Anna hurries into the ramp way.

                                     MARVIN
                         Anna. Examine your behavior.

               Marvin and the family disappear into the ramp way.

                                     AIRPORT LOUDSPEAKER (V.O.)
                         Dr. Leo Marvin, pick up the white 
                         courtesy phone. Dr. Leo Marvin, please 
                         answer the white courtesy phone.

               INT. A PHONE BOOTH, NEW YORK, DAY, CLOSE ON

               A long list of airline phone numbers with all but the last 
               one crossed out. PULL BACK TO FIND:

               BOB standing at a pay phone, receiver to his ear. He has 
               Kleenexes protecting his hand, his ear and his mouth. Outside 
               the window is a hot dog stand. The vendor is serving up juicy 
               hot dogs and Bob watches longingly.

                                     OPERATOR'S VOICE
                              (OVER PHONE)
                         I'm sorry, Bob. No one's answering 
                         the page.

                                     BOB
                              (INTO PHONE)
                         Thanks for trying.

               Bob hangs up and crumples the list.

               EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE THE PHONE BOOTH, SAME

               Still looking at the hot dogs, Bob shuffles out of the phone 
               booth. He tosses his crumpled list at a trash can and misses. 
               Even though there is litter on the street all around the 
               trash can, Bob (using a Kleenex) picks up his list and puts 
               it in the trash. He walks to the hot dog stand and watches. 
               He wants a hot dog.

                         Bob.

                         I sure would...

               The vendor buns a hot dog.

                         I sure would.

                         I'd love it.

               The vendor holds out the dog.

                                     BOB
                         But I can't. I really want to but I 
                         can't. It's bird intestine and beef 
                         brain.

               Bob looks at the dog with a mixture of desire and revulsion. 
               He pulls out an air sickness bag, holds it ready, then puts 
               it back. The vendor retracts the dog.

                                     VENDOR
                         Hit the road, bub.

                         Bob.

               Bob moves on.

               INT. A SUNNY NEW YORK FLAT, DAY

               Bob, out of breath, knocks on the door. HELENE WILEY, a late 
               middle aged woman draped in diaphanous scarves, opens the 
               door. She carries a palette knife and palette of paint.

                                     BOB
                         Hi, mom.

                                     HELENE
                         Bob, you didn't walk up again?

                                     BOB
                         I found this great psychiatrist who 
                         abandoned me.

               Helene turns and walks away. Bob follows her in. The next 
               scene is played with Helene walking away and Bob following. 
               They move through her apartment, dotted with finished and 
               half-finished paintings on big canvases.

                                     HELENE
                         Did you come here for money?

                                     BOB
                         Mom, that's a terrible thing to ask.

                                     HELENE
                         How do you like my latest?

               She stops in front of a BIG CANVAS covered with knives, 
               spoons, forks, paint, and twenty dollar bills. Bob touches 
               one of the twenties. It comes off in his hand.

                                     BOB
                         It's lovely mom.

               Helene takes the twenty and puts it back.

                                     HELENE
                         Bobby, please!

                                     BOB
                         Mom, I'm sorry! All I wanted to do 
                         was talk. I'll go.

               She reaches out and embraces him.

                                     HELENE
                         Oh my poor baby. How did you get so 
                         screwed up?

                                     BOB
                         Oh, mom.

                                     HELENE
                         You're the only thing I care about. 
                         Always will be.

                                     BOB
                         Oh mom.

               They stand there hugging for a moment.

                                     HELENE
                         I'm here for you, Bob. Anytime.

                                     BOB
                         I love you, mom.

               She looks at him and lovingly straightens his hair.

                                     HELENE
                         Go home, sweetie. I need to work.

               EXT. A STREET CORNER NEAR THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM, SAME

               Bob stands on the corner looking like a lost soul. He watches 
               as the world passes by. The light changes. Looking both ways 
               constantly, Bob crosses.

                                     BOB
                         Baby step across the street. Baby 
                         step across the street...

               A "perfect little family" walks past him. A five year old 
               girl and a three year old boy skip by, hand in hand. They 
               wave at Bob. He waves back, sadly, then continues.

                              (affectless)
                         I feel good, I feel great, I feel 
                         wonderful.

               INT. A BABY DECORATED APARTMENT, DAY

               "Crackling Rose" by Neil Diamond plays on the stereo. BECKY, 
               a perky woman, pregnant, about Bob's age, answers the door. 
               Bob stands in the hallway. She's a little surprised.

                                     BECKY
                         Hi.

                                     BOB
                         Whoa!... You're really getting big.

               Bob gently puts his hand on Becky's belly.

                                     BOB
                         What a bruiser. Hi little Bobby!

                                     BECKY
                              (gently)
                         Bob, he's not little Bobby. Feel the 
                         heartbeat?

               Bob puts his ear to Becky's belly and listens. Suddenly, he 
               hugs Becky's tummy.

                                     BOB
                         Oh, Becky, let's get married again.

                                     BECKY
                              (pulling away)
                         Bob. You know I'm married to some 
                         one else now.

                                     BOB
                              (holding on)
                         But I want a baby. A family! I want 
                         to burp him and change him and... 
                         love him!
                              (pause -- lets go)
                         Why couldn't it have been with me?

                                     BECKY
                         Bob, honey, we've been over this. 
                         You as a father? Think about it.

               Bob sinks. Becky looks at him sympathetically. There is still 
               a warm spot in her heart for him.

                                     BECKY
                         You know I actually have considered 
                         naming him "Bob".

                                     BOB
                         Really?!

                                     BECKY
                         Yeah. But it's still going to be 
                         "Neil".

                                     BOB
                              (recognizing Neil 
                              Diamond on the stereo)
                         Right.

               INT. BOB'S APARTMENT, LATE AFTERNOON

               Bob sits alone watching Ozzie and Harriet. Ozzie is talking 
               to Ricky, David, and Harriet.

                                     OZZIE
                         We're a family. We'll always be a 
                         family. I don't care what they say 
                         about you at school, we've got each 
                         other and don't you ever forget it.

               The family hugs. The TV audience applauds. Bob picks up the 
               phone and dials. SPLIT SCREEN with MID-MANHATTAN EXCHANGE a

                              (INTO PHONE)
                         This is Bob Wiley. I'm a patient of 
                         Dr. Marvin's. I need to talk to him. 
                         Urgently.

                                     BESSIE
                         I'm sorry Mr. Wiley --

                                     BOB
                         Bob.

                                     BESSIE
                         -- Bob, but Dr. Marvin is out of 
                         town and Dr. Harmon is taking his 
                         calls.

                                     BOB
                         I don't want Harmon, I need Marvin!

               Bob paces then assumes a false calm.

                                     BOB
                         Look, there seems to be some 
                         confusion. You see, Dr. Marvin, uh, 
                         Leo, wanted me to call him but I 
                         lost his number.

                                     BESSIE
                         Bob. I can't give out that number.

                                     BOB
                         But you could call him and ask him 
                         to call me.

                                     BESSIE
                         It's awfully late.

               Bob is silent. Bessie is uncertain.

                                     BESSIE
                         Stay on the line, Bob. What's your 
                         number in case we get disconnected?

               EXT. MARVIN'S VACATION HOUSE PORCH, LATE AFTERNOON

               We recognize this as the same lake the doctors were sailing 
               in the opening scene: gorgeous greenery, the shore lined 
               with quaint but expensive summer homes. Where the doctors in 
               the boat saw an empty slab, stands the Marvin summer house, 
               a clapboard structure complete with a private dock, old wooden 
               motorized rowboat, and diving board.

               Marvin is relaxing in a chair. Fay is in the background 
               putting out flowers. Marvin takes a deep breath, sighs 
               peacefully then picks up a book: Freud's Understanding Dreams 
               and opens it. The phone rings. Marvin frowns, then answers.

                                     MARVIN
                         Yes?

                                     BESSIE
                         Dr. Marvin, this is Bessie at your 
                         exchange. I'm sorry to disturb you 
                         but I have a Bob Wiley on the line 
                         who says you'll want to talk to him.

                                     MARVIN
                         You know better than this, Bessie. 
                         Dr. Harmon is covering for me.

                                     BESSIE
                         I told him that, Doctor, but he 
                         insists on talking to you. He says 
                         it's an emergency.

               Marvin frowns then takes a deep breath.

                                     MARVIN
                         Put him through.

                                     BESSIE
                         Go ahead, Bob.

               BACK TO DOUBLE SPLIT-SCREEN

               Bob's frantic pacing contrasts with Marvin's calm.

                                     MARVIN
                         Bob, I thought I made it clear to 
                         you that I'm on vacation.

                                     BOB
                         I know, but I'm a mess. Worse than 
                         usual.

                                     MARVIN
                         Bob, if this is an emergency, go to 
                         the emergency room. If not, call Dr. 
                         Harmon and I'm sure he can help you.

                                     BOB
                         I'd feel better if I just knew where 
                         you were. It's Martha's Vineyard 
                         right?

                                     MARVIN
                         Bob.

                                     BOB
                         Couldn't we just talk?

                                     MARVIN
                         In my office, after Labor Day.

                         Good night, Bob.

               Marvin hangs up. SINGLE SCREEN. Bob hangs up too. He stands 
               and thinks then dials again. SPLIT SCREEN WITH MID-MANHATTAN

                                     BESSIE
                         I'm sorry, Bob, but Dr. Marvin just 
                         called and instructed me not to put 
                         you through.

                                     BOB
                         What?

                              (INTO PHONE)
                         Hello, this is Lily Marvin, Dr. Leo 
                         Marvin's sister. I have to talk to 
                         my brother right away.

                              (skeptical)
                         I'm not allowed to give out that 
                         number. Don't you have it?

               A PULL BACK REVEALS BOB standing beside the prostitute, 
               wearing his face mask, waiting anxiously. Bob whispers in 
               the prostitute's ear. She nods.

                              (INTO PHONE)
                         He went on vacation and forgot to 
                         give it to me. Look, honey, it's 
                         urgent. I'm at: 790-8864.

               She reads the number off the pay phone. Bessie reacts to the 
               fact that it's a different number from Bob's. She shakes her 
               head and sighs.

                                     BESSIE
                         Stay on the line, Miss Marvin.

               The prostitute hands the phone to Bob. He sprays the phone 
               with disinfectant then hands her some money.

                                     BOB
                         Thanks. You were fantastic.

               background the Marvin family sits eating dinner. Marvin 
               holding the telephone, looking concerned, walks off by 
               himself.

                                     MARVIN
                         Lily? What's wrong?

                         It's Bob. I know I shouldn't call 
                         this way but --

                                     MARVIN
                         Bob, listen to me. The doctor-patient 
                         relationship is based on trust. When 
                         you call me against my wishes or 
                         pretend to be my sister, I can't 
                         trust you any more.

                         Call Dr. Harmon, or go to the 
                         emergency room, but don't call me 
                         here again.

               Marvin hangs up. BACK TO SINGLE SCREEN. Bob stands in the 
               phone booth, banging his hand on his head.

                         smart...

               He walks out of the booth shaking his head. He exits screen

                         Detective Roberts. Homicide.

                         What do you want?

                                     DETECTIVE ROBERTS
                              (FROM WITHOUT)
                         I have some questions about a Bob 
                         Wiley.

                                     BESSIE
                              (to Gwen)
                         That was that sicko who kept calling 
                         Dr. Marvin.
                              (loud)
                         What about him?

               She opens the door. Detective Roberts is Bob.

                                     BOB AS DETECTIVE ROBERTS
                         He's dead.

                                     BESSIE
                         Oh my god. What happened?

                                     BOB
                         Suicide. We think. Forty stories. 
                         Free fall. Splat.

               The operators gasp.

                                     BOB
                         Now our records show that Bob made 
                         several calls to this number just 
                         before he died. Did either of you 
                         know Bob personally?

                                     BESSIE
                         Bob called here trying to reach his 
                         psychiatrist.

                                     BOB
                         That's interesting. What happened?

                                     OPERATOR
                         I put him through once. After that, 
                         Dr. Marvin didn't want to talk to 
                         him again.

                                     BOB
                         Uh HUH.

                                     BESSIE
                         Wait a minute. Dr. Marvin couldn't 
                         have had anything to do with Bob's 
                         death.

                                     BOB
                         Oh? Why not?

                                     BESSIE
                         Dr. Marvin's on vacation.

                                     BOB
                         Ah.

                                     GWEN
                         Out of state. Lake Winnipesaukee.

                                     BOB
                         Michigan?

                                     BESSIE
                         New Hampshire.

                                     BOB
                         Right.

                                     BESSIE
                         We're not supposed to give out the 
                         number but I can call him and...

                                     BOB
                         That's okay. I'm sure we can find 
                         him if we need him.

               Bob writes down the information as he walks to the door.

                                     BESSIE
                         God, I feel terrible. What if I was 
                         the last person he talked to before 
                         he died?

                                     BOB
                         I frankly wouldn't let it bother me. 
                         This guy had "sky diver" written all 
                         over him if you know what I mean.

               Bob closes the door behind him.

               EXT. THE ANSWERING SERVICE HALLWAY, SAME

               Bob almost throws up then puts the air sickness bag away 
               again. He takes a deep breath, smiles to himself, then exits.

               INT. MARVIN'S SUMMER HOUSE BEDROOM, NIGHT

               Marvin and Fay are asleep in bed. The phone rings. Fay turns 
               on the light.

                                     MARVIN
                         That'd better not be who I think it 
                         is.

               Marvin answers the phone. Fay listens.

                                     MARVIN (INTO PHONE)
                         Hello... What?... That's okay. Thanks 
                         for calling, Bessie.

               Marvin hangs up. He sits, stunned.

                                     MARVIN
                         That was my service. That patient -- 
                         the one who called earlier -- 
                         committed suicide.

                                     FAY
                         Oh Leo, how horrible.

               Fay rubs Marvin's neck. There is a long pause.

                                     MARVIN
                         Oh well. Let's not let it ruin our 
                         vacation.

               Marvin turns out the light and lies down.

               INT. A BUS STATION, MORNING

               Bob wears bermuda shorts and baseball cap. In one hand, like 
               a security blanket, he clutches a paper bag spilling over 
               with clothes, bottles of pills, and Baby Steps. In the other 
               hand he clutches a baggie holding Gil. Eyes fixed ahead, Bob 
               stares at:

               A BUS looming large like a growling grumbling snorting 
               monster.

               BUS EMPLOYEE APPROACHES

                                     BUS EMPLOYEE
                         This is the last bus to Winnipesaukee, 
                         Bob.

                                     BOB
                         How many tunnels does it pass through 
                         again? How many bridges?

                                     BUS EMPLOYEE
                         If you keep your eyes closed, you 
                         won't see any of them. You ready?

                                     BOB
                         Baby steps, board the bus. Baby steps, 
                         board the bus.

               Bob looks at the bus again. He tips his bottle of pills and 
               swallows. He takes a small baby step towards the bus.

                                     BUS EMPLOYEE
                         You think you could do it today, 
                         Bob. We have a baby schedule to keep.

                                     BOB
                         Baby step, board today. Baby step, 
                         board today.

               Bob inches into the bus.

               INT. THE BUS, SAME

               A bus driver sits ready to go. Bob walks like a cripple down 
               the aisle to an empty seat.

                                     BOB
                         Baby step, down the aisle. Baby step, 
                         down the aisle.

               The passengers, a scurvy bunch, wait impatiently. Bob finally 
               takes a seat next to an old man and smiles nervously.

                                     BOB
                         Hi. I'm Bob.

               The old man scowls and looks forward. The bus driver closes 
               the door and the bus moves forward with a jolt.

                                     BOB
                         Ah!!
                              (turns to the old man)
                         Would you knock me out, please?! Hit 
                         me in the face, whatever you have to 
                         do, just knock me out!

               The old man moves away. Bob downs more pills.

               INT. THE HOLLAND TUNNEL, DAY

               The bus speeds through. We HEAR a long, loud SCREAM.

               EXT. THE MARVIN PORCH, DAY

               Marvin lies down in the hammock and picks up his book. Fay 
               enter.

                                     FAY
                         Honey, let's go to the store.

               EXT. THE OPEN COUNTRYSIDE, DAY

               The Greyhound bus stops. Bob gets out and runs into a field. 
               He apparently vomits, then runs back to the bus.

               INT. LAKE WINNIPESAUKEE GENERAL STORE, DAY

               The Marvin family strolls through this old fashioned General 
               Store, loading food and supplies into a shopping cart. They're 
               all in shorts and looking resorty except for Siggy who is in 
               his usual all-black garb. Through the windows, outside, we 
               can see the quaint little town of Winnipesaukee.

                                     MARVIN
                         Hugo said to expect eleven. Are you 
                         sure we have enough?

                                     FAY
                         We could feed the entire network, 
                         honey. Relax.

               Anna joins them and tosses in some cookies.

                                     MARVIN
                              (to Anna)
                         By the way, did you call Ted Fein?

                                     ANNA
                         Why? He's a salami with eyes.

                                     MARVIN
                         I thought he was cute.

                                     ANNA
                         How would you know a boy is cute? 
                         Are you coming out of the closet?

                                     FAY
                         Anna. Be nice.
                              (she fixes Anna's 
                              collar)

                                     MARVIN
                              (calmly)
                         She's just testing us, Fay. But don't 
                         get psycho-sexual with me young lady.

                                     ANNA
                         Me? When you want me to call some 
                         guy cause his father's your publicist?

                                     SIGGY
                         Yeah, dad. Don't be a psychosexual 
                         pimp.

                         Siggy, don't talk that way to your 
                         father.

                                     MARVIN
                         They're both testing us, Fay. Don't 
                         buy into it.

                                     SIGGY
                         Yeah, mom. It's not meant for you, 
                         it's meant for dad.
                              (at his father)
                         Testing. 1, 2, 3. Testing.

               EXT. THE BUS STOP ACROSS FROM THE GENERAL STORE, DAY

               A GREYHOUND BUS pulls to the bus stop. Passengers hurry off, 
               anxiously glancing behind them. Finally Bob, covered in sweat, 
               exits. Holding his bag and fish, squinting to adjust to the 
               sun, he stands in a daze as the bus pulls away. After a long 
               pause, Bob calls out.

                                     BOB
                         Dr. Marvin! Dr. Leo Marvin!

               Bob waits. Passers-by turn and stare. There is no Leo Marvin 
               in sight.

                                     BOB
                         Dr. Marvin! Dr. Leo Marvin!

               EXT. THE GENERAL STORE, SAME

               The Marvin family exits carrying groceries. They stop at the 
               family station wagon and begin loading up.

                                     BOB (O.S.)
                         Dr. Leo Marvin. Dr. Leo Marvin.

                                     FAY
                         Leo, is somebody calling you?

                         I didn't hear anything.

                                     BOB (O.S.)
                         Leo Marvin. Dr. Leo Marvin!

               Everyone looks around.

                         Over there.

               Marvin turns and sees Bob.

                                     MARVIN
                         Oh my god... I don't believe it.

               AT THE BUS STOP

               Bob looks in all directions. Suddenly he sees Marvin.

                                     BOB
                         Dr. Marvin. It's you!!

               Bob walks toward the Marvins.

               MARVIN

               stands dumfounded. He watches Bob walking towards them. He 
               tries to stay calm.

                                     MARVIN
                         Everybody get in the car.

                         Do you know that man, Leo?

                                     BOB
                         Dr. Marvin! It's me, Bob!

                                     MARVIN
                              (intense)
                         Get in the car.

               Fay is surprised to see Leo so forceful. She hustles the 
               kids into the station wagon. Bob hurries up, out of breath. 
               In one hand he holds his bag. In the other he holds Gil in a 
               baggie. Marvin closes the station wagon door and stands 
               outside.

                                     BOB
                         Hi! This is Gil. It must be fate 
                         that I found you so quickly!

               Bob stops and stands, a little out of breath.

                                     BOB
                         Is this a bad time?

                                     MARVIN
                         What are you doing here? I thought 
                         you were..., dead.

                                     BOB
                         Oh no, they told you? I fibbed a 
                         little but... Don't be mad.
                              (spotting the family 
                              in the car)
                         Oh...

               A sweet beatific smile appears on Bob's face. He sighs.

                                     BOB
                         The fam.

               Marvin leads Bob away from the car, across the street.

               EXT. ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE PARKING LOT, SAME

               Marvin stops and faces Bob.

                                     MARVIN
                         I think you know, Bob, that your 
                         behavior is entirely inappropriate. 
                         We talked about trust. We talked 
                         about my needs. I want you to get on 
                         a bus and go back to New York.

                                     BOB
                         You're angry.

                                     MARVIN
                         I don't get angry.

                                     BOB
                         You're upset.

                                     MARVIN
                         I don't get upset.

                                     BOB
                         Then can't we just talk?

                                     MARVIN
                         I don't see patients on vacation, 
                         Bob. Ever. How many ways can I make 
                         that clear?

                                     BOB
                         But you can't just send me away! 
                         I've read your book, I've been doing 
                         what you told me, but I've completely 
                         relapsed! A little time would mean 
                         so much. Please.

                                     MARVIN
                         Bob, I'm driving away now and I don't 
                         want you to bother me again. You 
                         came for my advice, correct?

                                     BOB
                         Absolutely.

                                     MARVIN
                         Then take my advice and go back to 
                         New York.

                                     BOB
                         But I can't go anywhere! I'm all 
                         locked up!

                                     MARVIN
                         You got yourself here.

                                     BOB
                         Barely!

                                     MARVIN
                         Getting back will therapeutic.

               Bob starts begging.

                                     BOB
                         Please just talk to me. Just a little 
                         talk.

                                     MARVIN
                         You're testing my patience, Bob.

                                     BOB
                         A teeny tiny talk. An itty bitty 
                         talk...

               ANGLE FROM INSIDE THE CAR, WHAT THE FAMILY SEES

               Bob is kneeling in front of Marvin.

                                     BOB
                         Pretty please... Pretty please with 
                         sugar...

               The family exchanges quizzical looks.

               BACK TO BOB AND MARVIN

               Marvin looks around, incredibly embarrassed. He tugs at the 
               kneeling Bob.

                                     MARVIN
                              (gritted teeth)
                         Get up. Come on, get up.

                                     BOB
                              (standing)
                         Say you will. Please, say you will.

               Marvin looks at his watch.

                                     MARVIN
                         Bob, it's two o'clock. Go to the bus 
                         station, buy a ticket home, then 
                         wait in that restaurant.

               He points to "GUTTMAN'S" coffee shop.

                                     BOB
                         You'll meet me?!

                                     MARVIN
                         I'll call you.
                              (looks at his watch)
                         In two hours.

                                     BOB
                         Oh my god, you're the greatest!

               Bob moves to hug Marvin and Marvin reluctantly lets him.

                                     MARVIN
                         But you must buy your ticket and 
                         give your word that you'll go home. 
                         This is all about trust again, Bob. 
                         We must have trust.

                                     BOB
                         I trust. I absolutely trust. I'll go 
                         buy my ticket. Right now!

                                     MARVIN
                         I'll call you at four.

                                     BOB
                         You couldn't possibly make it three 
                         thirty, could you?

                                     MARVIN
                         Bob...

                                     BOB
                         Four it is. Four o'clock exactly. 
                         Thank you, Dr. M.

               Bob starts across the parking lot as Marvin gets in the car 
               and closes the door.

               INT. THE MARVIN FAMILY STATION WAGON, SAME

               As the car pulls out of the parking lot, Marvin's family 
               turns to look at Bob. Bob smiles and waves at the family.

                                     FAY
                         Leo, you look disturbed.

                                     MARVIN
                         I'm fine.

                                     FAY
                         Who was that poor man?

                                     MARVIN
                         Nobody.

               Anna is looking out the back window at Bob. She waves.

                                     ANNA
                         He's cute.

               Marvin hits the accelerator, leaving rubber.

               INT. GUTTMAN'S COFFEE SHOP, LATER

               An ELDERLY COUPLE tend to the counters and glasses. Bob paces 
               by the phone, reading Baby Steps to himself. The clock on 
               the wall reads three o'clock.

                                     BOB
                         Baby step to four o'clock. Baby step 
                         to four o'clock.

               Bob covers his eyes then looks at the clock. No luck. 
               Frustrated, Bob paces again.

                                     BOB
                         I feel good, I feel great, I feel 
                         four o'clock!

               Again he looks at the clock: three-o-one. The elderly couple 
               watch. They speak with thick European accents.

                                     ELDERLY WOMAN (MRS. GUTTMAN)
                         Sonny, your fishy's losing air.

                                     BOB
                         Huh?

                                     ELDERLY MAN (MR. GUTTMAN)
                         Your guppy.

               Bob looks at Gil. The baggie is dripping.

                                     BOB
                         Oh. Thanks.

               Bob looks for something to do about the dripping baggie. Mr. 
               Guttman brings a glass and dumps Gil in.

                                     BOB
                         Thank you.

                                     MR. GUTTMAN
                         Is there something we can help you 
                         with?

                                     BOB
                         Can you make it four o'clock? Dr. 
                         Marvin's supposed to call me then 
                         but I'm going crazy.

                                     MRS. GUTTMAN
                         Not Dr. Leo Marvin?

                                     BOB
                         Do you know him?

                                     MRS. GUTTMAN
                         He bought our dream house. We worked 
                         a lifetime, saved up for a down 
                         payment, then he swooped down with 
                         his fancy schmancy lawyers and grabbed 
                         it out from under us.

                                     MR. GUTTMAN
                         Stay as far away from him as possible.

                                     MRS. GUTTMAN
                         Like the plague.

                                     BOB
                         No problem. I'm his patient but he 
                         doesn't want me near him.

                                     MR. GUTTMAN
                         We'll show you where he lives.

               EXT. THE MARVIN SUMMER HOUSE, SAME

               Marvin and Siggy march to the end of the Marvin dock. There 
               is a diving board. Siggy stands in a black terry robe and 
               flip flops.

                                     MARVIN
                         Take off your robe. Everything you 
                         wear is black. I wish you'd get off 
                         this death fixation.

               Siggy reluctantly takes off his black robe. Under it he wears 
               a black t-shirt and black bathing suit.

                                     SIGGY
                         How do you know it's a death fixation? 
                         Maybe I'm in mourning for my lost 
                         childhood.

                                     MARVIN
                         What do you mean by that?

                                     SIGGY
                         What do you mean by asking?

                                     MARVIN
                         Come on, get on the board and let's 
                         see your approach.

                                     SIGGY
                              (striking a pose)
                         My approach is to be suave and 
                         debonair and sophisticated.

                                     MARVIN
                         Come on, Siggy. 1, 2, 3 spring. Like 
                         we learned last time. 1, 2, 3, spring.

               Siggy reluctantly mounts the board. He stands, feet together, 
               then takes a step with his right foot.

                                     SIGGY
                         1, 2, 3 spring. 1, 2, 3 summer. 1, 
                         2, 3 fall. Time to go dad.

                                     MARVIN
                         Cut it out, Siggy. Left foot...

                                     SIGGY
                         This is no fun.

               Siggy sighs then starts again. He awkwardly takes two steps 
               then stops at the end of the board, staring into the water, 
               afraid to dive.

                                     MARVIN
                         Why didn't you dive?

                                     SIGGY
                         With all the horror that's going on 
                         in the world, what difference does 
                         it make?

               INT. MARVIN SUMMER HOUSE, SAME

               The decor is New England cottage-y with a strong dose of Leo 
               Marvin: incredibly ordered. On a pedestal is a bust of Sigmund 
               Freud. On the mantle sit the family puppets: -- Anna, Siggy, 
               Fay, and Leo. Anna is at the family stereo, selecting a CD. 
               Fay is on the chordless phone at the kitchen window, giving 
               milk to some stray cats.

                                     FAY
                              (INTO PHONE)
                         Of course I'm excited Ellie. The 
                         last person they interviewed on 
                         vacation was Dr Ruth.

               Siggy enters and walks upstairs. Marvin enters and heads to 
               the living room chair. Fay hangs up.

                                     FAY
                         He didn't dive.

                                     MARVIN
                         No.

                                     FAY
                         He's a little afraid of it, dear. 
                         Have patience.

                                     MARVIN
                         It's not like I'm making him jump 
                         out of an airplane. When I was growing 
                         up, I thought diving was fun.

                                     ANNA
                         I thought you were born grown up.

               Marvin stares at Anna. She puts on raucous heavy metal.

                                     MARVIN
                         You're masking hostility, Anna Marvin. 
                         Turn that down.

                                     ANNA
                         It's full of Freudian symbols, dad. 
                         It's educational.

               Marvin turns down the volume, sits in his big easy chair, 
               then takes a deep breath. He picks up Freud's Understanding 
               Dreams. Anna puts on headphones and dances around wildly. 
               Marvin tries to read. Suddenly a face appears in the window. 
               It is Bob. He sees Marvin and taps on the window. Marvin 
               looks up and sees Bob.

                                     MARVIN
                         What the...?
                              (he bolts to the front 
                              door)
                         What are you doing here?

               Bob stands holding Gil (in the glass) and his bag.

                                     BOB
                         I'm sorry. Don't be mad. The Guttmans 
                         brought me.

               Bob turns and waves at the Guttmans who are walking into an 
               OLD TRAILER that occupies next lot.

                                     BOB
                         Thank you Mr. and Mrs. G.!

                                     MRS. GUTTMAN
                         Your welcome, Bobby, Hello, Dr. 
                         Marvin!

               The Guttmans wave. Marvin waves back.

                                     MRS. GUTTMAN
                         Burn in hell, Dr. Marvin!

               Marvin's hand falls. The Guttmans enter their trailer. Marvin 
               turns to Bob.

                                     MARVIN
                         We agreed that I would call you. 
                         Your coming here is unbelievably 
                         inappropriate.

               Anna comes to the door.

                                     ANNA
                         Hi. I'm Anna.

                                     BOB
                         I saw your picture. I'm Bob.

               Fay comes to the door.

                                     BOB
                         Hi. I'm Bob.

                                     FAY
                         I'm Fay.

                                     BOB
                         Oh, Mrs. M. You're even prettier 
                         than your picture.

                                     FAY
                         Why thank you.

                                     MARVIN
                              (through his teeth)
                         Bob, I think you and I have some 
                         things to talk about.

                                     BOB
                         You do? You finally think so too?!

                                     MARVIN
                              (to Fay)
                         Would you excuse us, dear?

                                     FAY
                         Bob, may I take your fish?

               Bob hands Gil to Fay and she walks into the kitchen. Anna 
               just stands there.

                                     MARVIN
                         Anna.

               Anna rolls her eyes and follows her mother.

                                     ANNA
                         Nice to meet you, Bob.

                                     BOB
                         You too.

               Marvin leads Bob away. Bob sees the puppets on the mantle.

               INT. THE MARVIN HOUSE STUDY, SAME

               Bob and Marvin enter the downstairs study. Marvin indicates 
               for Bob to take a seat.

                                     BOB
                         Great place. No wonder the Guttmans 
                         wanted it. I really feel bad about 
                         barging in like this.

                                     MARVIN
                         Forget it. I understand.

                                     BOB
                         You do?

                                     MARVIN
                         Of course I do. Your problems don't 
                         go away just because I go on vacation. 
                         They've been with you a long time 
                         after all.

                                     BOB
                         Ever since I can remember.

                                     MARVIN
                         On the other hand, you're making 
                         strides. You got here.

                                     BOB
                         I baby stepped. I owe it to you.

               Bob smiles. Marvin stares at Bob for a long time then:

                                     MARVIN
                         Bob, take a look around you. What 
                         does everything you see have in 
                         common?

                                     BOB
                         Er... I don't know... It's all owned 
                         by you, that's obvious. Humm... 
                         Everything's from a garage sale!

               There is a long pause. Marvin stares at Bob.

                                     MARVIN
                         Vacation, Bob. Everything you see is 
                         part of a vacation. Every year, for 
                         one month, I bring my family to this 
                         house on vacation. Nice, isn't it?

                                     BOB
                         It's wonderful. The lake. The trees. 
                         The little town.

                                     MARVIN
                         Do you know what the point of a 
                         vacation is? Do you understand the 
                         meaning of the word?

                                     BOB
                         Sure.

                                     MARVIN
                         You forget about your troubles. You 
                         give up your worries. You drink from 
                         the wellspring of relaxation that 
                         enriches your soul.
                              (pause)
                         Now I can't, at this time, give you 
                         the kind of therapeutic attention 
                         that you need to solve all your 
                         problems. Know why?

                                     BOB
                         Er, because you're on vacation?

                                     MARVIN
                         Excellent. But what I can do -- and 
                         only I can do this because you trust 
                         me don't you Bob?

                                     BOB
                         Why else would I be here?

                                     MARVIN
                         Exactly. What I can do is this.

               Marvin goes to a drawer and pulls out a prescription pad. He 
               writes.

                                     MARVIN
                         Get on your bus and go back to New 
                         York. Every time a problem comes up, 
                         follow this prescription.

                                     BOB
                              (holds up his bag)
                         I don't need pills. I have plenty of 
                         pills.

               Marvin tears off a prescription sheet and hands it to bob.

                                     MARVIN
                         It's not pills. Read it.

                                     BOB
                              (taking it)
                         It says: "A vacation from my 
                         problems."

                                     MARVIN
                         I'm giving you permission to take a 
                         vacation, Bob. Not a vacation from 
                         your work. Not a vacation from your 
                         daily life. But a vacation from...

                                     BOB
                         My problems.

                                     MARVIN
                         Every time you feel a problem coming 
                         on, take that out and follow it to 
                         the letter. Doctors orders.

                                     BOB
                         Doctors orders.

               Marvin stands.

                                     MARVIN
                         I'm glad you came. I'll see you in 
                         my office next month.

                                     BOB
                         That's it?

                                     MARVIN
                         You came here for relief, Bob. Read 
                         your prescription.

               Bob stands a moment, looking at his prescription.

                                     BOB
                         This is... INCREDIBLE! This is 
                         ASTOUNDING!! For the first time since 
                         Menningers I feel free! I knew coming 
                         up here was the right thing to do!

                                     MARVIN
                         It feels right because you're here 
                         and because you're leaving.

               Bob comes over and hugs Marvin.

                                     BOB
                         You've given me a great gift, doctor. 
                         The gift of life. You're a great 
                         man.

               EXT.-INT. THE MARVIN HOUSE, DAY

               Marvin opens the door for Bob.

                                     MARVIN
                         If you have any questions, call Dr. 
                         Harmon.

                                     BOB
                         Have a great vacation!

                                     MARVIN
                         You too.

                                     BOB
                         A vacation from my problems. You bet 
                         I will!

               Bob exits. Marvin closes the door and looks up at the ceiling. 
               He takes a deep breath then turns back into the room. There 
               is a knock at the door.

                                     MARVIN
                              (AT THE DOOR)
                         Yes?

                                     BOB
                              (FROM WITHOUT)
                         It's Bob. I forgot Gil.

               Marvin opens the door.

                                     BOB
                         My fish.

                                     MARVIN
                         Oh. Right.

               Bob strides into the kitchen and takes his fish. Sigmund, 
               now in his clothes, enters from upstairs.

                                     BOB
                         You must be Sigmund.

                                     MARVIN
                         Siggy, this is Bob. He's just leaving.

                                     SIGGY
                         Hi.

                                     BOB
                         Hi. This is Gil. My fish.

                                     SIGGY
                         Cool. Did you get him out of the 
                         lake?

                                     BOB
                         No. He's a city fish.

                                     SIGGY
                         Cool.

                                     BOB
                         Your father is the most incredible 
                         psychiatrist in the world! You better 
                         appreciate him.

               He strides to the door then turns wistfully.

                                     BOB
                         Have a great vacation, fam.

                                     MARVIN
                         You too, Bob.

                                     SIGGY
                         Nice to meet you.

               EXT. A WOODED LANE IN WINNIPESAUKEE, DAY

               Bob walks down the country lane. Crickets chirp.

                                     BOB
                         Vacation from my problems. Take a 
                         vacation from my problems. A baby 
                         stepping, lazy stepping vacation 
                         from my problems.

               Bob falls into a rhythm, almost a little jig as he walks.

                                                          LONG DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. LAKE WINNIPESAUKEE, MORNING

               Roosters crow in the new day.

               INT. THE MARVIN LIVING ROOM, SAME

               Marvin, Fay and Siggy stand frozen, like artist's models, 
               staring at something. Is this suddenly a Godard movie? Are 
               we now in a Becket play? Finally:

                                     MARVIN
                         It's too close to the wall.

                                     SIGGY
                         Who cares?

               Marvin moves to the couch and pulls it out from the wall 
               about three inches.

                                     MARVIN
                         I care, and you should too. Our house 
                         is going on national television 
                         tomorrow. You want your friends to 
                         think you live in a dump?

                                     SIGGY
                         My friends would respect me for it.

                                     MARVIN
                         You know, there's nothing wrong with 
                         neatness. People joke but it's 
                         actually a sign of a creative 
                         intelligence. Right, Fay?

                                     FAY
                         In isolated cases, sure.

                                     MARVIN
                         What is that supposed to mean?

                                     FAY
                         The room looks wonderful, dear.

               Fay pecks him on the cheek and walks into the kitchen. Siggy 
               follows. Ditto Anna who starts cooking pancakes.

                                     MARVIN
                         Seriously, what do you mean by that?

               He gets no answer from the rest of the family who look at 
               each other and smile.

                                     ANNA
                         You're incredibly creative, daddy.

               Marvin goes back to making minuscule adjustments: adjusting 
               diplomas, etc. At the front door is a knock.

                                     MARVIN
                         I'll get it. It's probably the van 
                         with my art.

               Checking out his "set" as he goes, Marvin opens the door. 
               It's Bob.

                                     BOB
                         Good morning! I'll bet you're 
                         surprised to see me!

               MARVIN STANDS DUMFOUNDED

                                     BOB
                         When I walked out of here last night 
                         I said to myself, "Dr. Marvin's 
                         absolutely right. Take a vacation 
                         from your problems. Blow em off. 
                         Just say 'no'." So I did!

                                     MARVIN
                         But... You're back.

                                     BOB
                         No I'm not.

                                     MARVIN
                         You're not?!

                                     BOB
                         Of course not. I'm taking a vacation. 
                         This isn't an appointment, I'm 
                         dropping by. I told the Guttmans 
                         what you said and they found me a 
                         cottage nearby.

                                     MARVIN
                         No...

                                     BOB
                         Yeah, the town is packed but I guess 
                         if you know the right people... 
                         Anyway, I know we can't work but 
                         let's get the friendship thing going.

               Marvin is absolutely flabbergasted.

                                     BOB
                         I'm a little anxious about being 
                         here by myself but I don't want to 
                         barge in. I'll call. Give my best to 
                         the fam and see ya around, okay?

               Bob walks away. Marvin closes the door. He stands there for 
               a long time.

                                     FAY
                         Who was that, Leo?

                                     MARVIN
                         Nobody.

                                     SIGGY
                         Again?

               There is a knock on the door. Marvin opens it.

                                     BOB
                         I almost forgot, here's your 
                         newspaper. See ya.

               Marvin takes the newspaper and closes the door.

                                     ANNA
                         Wasn't that Bob?

               There is another knock on the door. It's Bob.

                                     BOB
                         You guys up for going out to 
                         breakfast?

                                     MARVIN
                         No!

                                     BOB
                         Eating in. I admire that.

               Marvin slams the door in Bob's face.

                                     ANNA
                         That was Bob! I thought you said he 
                         left town?

                                     MARVIN
                         I did. I said exactly that.

               Anna moves to the front door, after Bob. Marvin grabs her 
               arm and leads her to the kitchen.

                                     MARVIN
                         And I don't want you letting him in 
                         this house.

                                     ANNA
                         Daddy, you're hurting me!

               Anna wrenches her arm away.

                                     ANNA
                         What's your problem?

                                     MARVIN
                         I don't have a problem.

               Fay walks in.

                                     FAY
                         Honey, who is that man?

                                     MARVIN
                         Nobody, Fay. Nothing to get excited 
                         about. A work related problem just 
                         went away.
                              (smiles nonchalantly)
                         It's fine.

               He strolls off into the kitchen. Anna rubs her arm.

                                     ANNA
                         I've never seen him like this.

                                     FAY
                              (low)
                         If you want to know, I think your 
                         father is nervous about going on 
                         national television tomorrow. Freud 
                         himself would be anxious so let's be 
                         supportive, okay?

                                     ANNA
                         He should go punch some pillows.

                                     SIGGY
                         Or get shock treatment.

                                     FAY
                         Remember that he's under pressure.

                                     MARVIN (FROM THE KITCHEN)
                         Flap jacks!

               EXT. A WOODED LANE IN WINNIPESALRKEE, DAY

               Bob walks down the empty country lane. Crickets chirp.

                                     BOB
                         Vacation from my problems. Take a 
                         vacation from my problems. There's 
                         nothing to fear, there's nobody here. 
                         Nothing to fear
                              (he suddenly panics)
                         THERE'S NOBODY HERE!

               He starts running and screaming.

               EXT. THE MARVIN SUMMER HOUSE, MORNING

               TWO MEN from a van are bringing in the art from Marvin's 
               office. Marvin is using a weed trimmer to spruce up the shrubs 
               to within an inch or their lives. Anna, in a bathing suit, 
               sunglasses, and skimpy cover-up exits the house, gives her 
               father a good-bye peck on the cheek then gets in the family 
               station wagon.

                                     MARVIN
                         Where are you off to?

                                     ANNA
                         Sailing.

                                     MARVIN
                         With Teddy Fein?

                                     ANNA
                         No. George Stark. The boy from the 
                         plane.

                                     MARVIN
                         It's a quarter mile to the marina. 
                         Why do you need the car?

                                     ANNA
                         I'm picking everybody up.

               She starts the car and backs out.

                                     MARVIN
                         Stay out of the sun! Remember what's 
                         happening to the ozone layer.

               EXT. A WOODED LANE IN WINNIPESAUKEE, DAY

               Bob is running in a panic. Anna drives by and sees him.

                                     ANNA
                         Bob!

               Anna hits the brakes and slows next to Bob. He breaks to a 
               slow trot.

                                     ANNA
                         Hi! Where you going?

                                     BOB
                         Just to... town.
                              (pause)
                         Buy some..., Kleenex.

                                     ANNA
                         Want a ride?

                                     BOB
                         I don't think your dad would like 
                         you picking me up.

                                     ANNA
                         He wouldn't like a lot of things. 
                         Hop in.

               Bob hesitates then gets in.

               INT. THE MARVIN STATION WAGON, SAME

               Anna drives. Bob puts on his seat belt.

                                     BOB
                         He seemed pretty upset this morning.

                                     ANNA
                         He's nervous about the interview.

                                     BOB
                         Interview?

                                     ANNA
                         Maria Shriver's coming tomorrow to 
                         talk about his book.

                                     BOB
                         Wow... so that's the problem! And I 
                         thought he was upset about me!

                                     ANNA
                         Well he's always uptight, even when 
                         it doesn't show.

                                     BOB
                         He is?

                                     ANNA
                         Sure. Imagine growing up with a dad 
                         who sees every stage of growing up 
                         as a Freudian passage. Did you ever 
                         have crayons?

                                     BOB
                         Sure.

                                     ANNA
                         Fat or skinny?

                                     BOB
                         Er, skinny, I think.

                                     ANNA
                              (warning tone)
                         Uh oh.

                                     BOB
                         What do you mean?

                                     ANNA
                         Dad saw crayons as phallic symbols. 
                         When I asked for skinny crayons, it 
                         was a personal assault on his manhood.

                                     BOB
                         What'd he do, buy a Porsche?

               Anna laughs.

                                     ANNA
                         I wish! He just kept psychoanalyzing 
                         everything. My dolls were alter egos. 
                         Boys who wanted to kiss me were 
                         Oedipally fixated adolescents looking 
                         to displace their mothers on their 
                         aboriginal family totems.

                                     BOB
                         Sounds like my friends to a tee.
                              (a beat)
                         You seem to be doing okay now.

                                     ANNA
                         Hardly. I analyze everything to death. 
                         Every time a guy smiles at me, I ask 
                         myself is he really smiling or is he 
                         just orally fixated? When I smile 
                         back, I wonder, am I really attracted 
                         or just smiling out of some residual 
                         Cro-Magnon instinct? If I ever 
                         actually have sex, I'm not sure I'll 
                         know the difference between an orgasm 
                         and an anxiety attack!

                                     BOB
                         I have the same problem.

                                     ANNA
                         The kinds of urges other girls act 
                         on impulsively, I analyze until either 
                         the urge goes away or --

                                     BOB
                         Or what?

                                     ANNA
                         The boy goes away.

               Long pause.

                                     BOB
                         Well. It sounds like your dad never 
                         learned to leave his work at the 
                         office.

                                     ANNA
                         Lot of good it does me!

                                     BOB
                         You'll make some man very happy 
                         someday.

               This hangs in the air. Anna looks at Bob.

                                     ANNA
                         What are you doing today?

                                     BOB
                         Buying Kleenex.

                                     ANNA
                         Wanna come sailing?

                                     BOB
                         Well, I... I, er...

                                     ANNA
                         That's okay. You don't have to.

               Bob looks at Anna. He sees her attraction to him and it makes 
               him nervous but he doesn't want to reject her. He looks down 
               shyly.

                                     BOB
                         Actually, it's not that I don't want 
                         to go. It's just that I've never 
                         been on a boat and I'm not sure I 
                         can handle it.

                                     ANNA
                         There's nothing to it. George Stark's 
                         doing the sailing.

                                     BOB
                         Just thinking about gives me hives.

               EXT. GEORGE STARK'S DAY SAILBOAT, DAY. CLOSE ON BOB

               Standing next to the mast, his hair blowing in the wind.

                                     BOB
                         You're right, this is great! I never 
                         actually thought I could do this. I 
                         never thought this could be me!

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               That Bob, wearing life preservers on his body and legs, is 
               wrapped onto the mast from chest to toe with ropes. Anna, 
               George Stark (from the airport) and a few other kids sit 
               around enjoying the sail.

               EXT. THE MARVIN PRIVATE DOCK, DAY

               Marvin stands at the end of the diving board, holding Siggy 
               by his ankles out over the water. On the shore next door, 
               the Guttmans sit in lounge chairs, fishing.

                                     SIGGY
                         This is child abuse! If you drop me, 
                         I'll prosecute!

                                     MARVIN
                         I am not going to let go until you're 
                         ready, okay? Trust me and put your 
                         hands out like I showed you.

                                     SIGGY
                         I'm not ready! Do you hear? I'm not 
                         ready!!

               George's sailboat heels by. From it wave Anna and some of 
               her friends -- and Bob.

                                     BOB
                              (shouting and waving)
                         Hey Doctor M, look at me! I'm sailing!

               Stunned, Marvin drops Siggy into the water. Siggy does a 
               belly flop then comes up for air, furious.

                                     SIGGY
                         Murderer! Child molester...

                                     MARVIN
                         Siggy, it was an accident!

                                     THE GUTTMANS
                         Hitler!

               EXT. A PIER NEAR WINNIPESAUKEE TOWN, LATER

               Marvin walks along the shore towards the pier in time to see 
               Anna and a wobbly Bob disembark George's sailboat.

                                     MARVIN
                         Anna!

               Anna sees her father. She says good-bye to George and her 
               friends then walks towards her father. Bob starts towards 
               Marvin too.

                                     BOB
                         Did you see me out there?! I'm getting 
                         better all the time.

                                     MARVIN
                         I want to see Anna alone.

               Bob stops. Marvin waits while Anna walks to him.

                                     MARVIN
                         I thought I told you to stay away 
                         from Bob Wiley.

                                     ANNA
                         No. You just said I couldn't let him 
                         in the house.

               Marvin starts walking away from the sailboating party towards 
               the town green. He puts his arm around Anna so that she has 
               to walk with him.

                                     ANNA
                         Daddy, where are we going?

                                     MARVIN
                         Home.

                                     ANNA
                         What about the car? I left it at the 
                         pier.

                                     MARVIN
                         Leave it. It's been a while since 
                         I've had a walk with my daughter.

               Anna looks back at her friends and Bob. She shrugs then turns 
               back to her father. From his pockets Marvin removes the Leo 
               and Anna puppets and hands her "Anna".

                                     ANNA
                         Daddy, not here!

                                     MARVIN PUPPET
                         Anna, I know you think you're old 
                         enough to know what's best for you 
                         and I know you're at the age where 
                         you don't want to listen to your 
                         father. But as your father, who's 
                         always loved you, I'm asking you not 
                         to see Bob Wiley.

               Anna grabs the Anna puppet and puts it on, defiantly.

                                     ANNA PUPPET
                         I don't understand the problem! Bob's 
                         a nice guy!

                                     MARVIN PUPPET
                         Bob Wiley is a patient. He followed 
                         me here from New York which is 
                         bizarre. But even if it weren't 
                         bizarre, my daughter seeing a patient 
                         that I'm treating is entirely 
                         inappropriate.

                                     ANNA PUPPET
                         Bob said you're not treating him 
                         here.

                                     MARVIN PUPPET
                         He's right there!

                                     ANNA PUPPET
                         So if you're not treating him while 
                         he's here, then he's not a patient 
                         while he's here, is he? And I have 
                         the right to see him!

               She throws the puppet at Marvin then runs to her friends.

                                     MARVIN PUPPET
                         Anna, you're acting out!

                                     ANNA
                         Bob's a perfectly nice guy! He's 
                         intense and sensitive and he listens 
                         which is more than I can say about 
                         you. Bob!

               Marvin stands a moment and watches. He is stunned.

                                     MARVIN PUPPET
                         Anna, come back!

               Anna runs to Bob and takes his arm. They start walking down 
               the shore. Marvin is dumbstruck.

               INT./EXT. THE MARVIN HOUSE, LATER

               Siggy lies on the deck, looking up at the sky through 
               binoculars. Fay is in the kitchen, arranging driftwood. She 
               comes to the back door of the cottage.

                                     FAY
                         Why don't you come in and talk about 
                         it?

               Siggy says nothing.

                                     FAY
                         Just because your father dropped you 
                         in the water doesn't mean you can't 
                         trust me.

                                     SIGGY
                         You sleep with him. You're his spy.

               INT. THE FRONT DOOR OF THE MARVIN HOUSE, SAME

               Marvin enters, looking absolutely stunned.

                                     FAY
                         Leo, you've upset Siggy.

               Marvin stares blankly at Fay then shuffles up the stairs.

                                     FAY
                         Leo...?

               Again Marvin doesn't answer and Fay starts towards him.

                                     SIGGY
                         That's right, go to him! You always 
                         do.

               Fay stops, looks at Siggy then goes upstairs after Leo.

               EXT. THE DECK, DAY

               Siggy lies back down and peers through the binoculars. As he 
               does, a grotesque CLOSE UP OF BOB pops into Siggy's field of 
               view. He sits up with a start. Bob and Anna are standing 
               over him.

                                     BOB
                         Hey, Siggy.

                                     SIGGY
                         Oh. Hi, Bob. You scared me.

                                     BOB
                         Sorry. Didn't mean to sneak up on 
                         you.

               Siggy lies back down and looks through the binoculars, clearly 
               not interested in being social. Bob looks at Anna. She shakes 
               her head.

                                     ANNA
                         Dad's at it again. I can tell.
                              (to Siggy)
                         Another vacation that's not a 
                         vacation, right?

                                     SIGGY
                         What's with him and diving? Maria 
                         Shriver's not gonna watch me dive!

               INT. THE MARVIN HOUSE BEDROOM, SAME

               Marvin is prostrate on the bed, Marvin puppet still on his 
               hand, staring at the ceiling. Fay enters. She sits down next 
               to Marvin and strokes his hair.

                                     FAY
                         Leo, Siggy is really upset.

               Marvin says nothing.

                                     FAY
                         Leo...

               Marvin looks at his wife.

                                     MARVIN
                         Fay, I'm a failure.

                                     FAY
                         What?

                                     MARVIN
                         Our daughter, our only daughter, has 
                         fallen for a brilliant manipulator 
                         twice her age.

                                     FAY
                         Leo, for god's sake talk sense.

                                     MARVIN
                         Anna and Bob!

               EXT. THE MARVIN PRIVATE DOCK, SAME

               Siggy is standing on the diving board, ready for his approach. 
               Bob and Anna watch from the pier. Next door the Guttmans sit 
               watching.

                                     BOB
                         Face a fear and it goes away.

                                     SIGGY
                         Okay. I'm facing it, now what do I 
                         do?

                                     BOB
                         Hit it. Fast. While it isn't looking.

               Siggy takes a deep breath, summons up his courage, and makes 
               his approach. He springs but can't dive.

                                     SIGGY
                         My mind says "yes yes" but my body 
                         says "no no". It's hopeless.

                                     BOB
                         If I'm not hopeless, nothing's 
                         hopeless...

               Bob steps onto the board. He "baby steps" out to the end 
               where Siggy is standing.

                                     BOB
                         Let's try something I saw in a pirate 
                         movie.

               INT. THE MARVIN BEDROOM, SAME

               Marvin is down the hall in the bathroom, dousing his face 
               with water. Fay stands in the bedroom.

                                     MARVIN
                         For God's sake, I'm even a failure 
                         in my own book! Can you believe it? 
                         In Chapter 2, I wrote that a healthy 
                         adolescent girl can never have a 
                         sublimated father complex and my 
                         daughter has one.

                                     FAY
                         It's a brief flirtation, honey. Anna's 
                         perfectly healthy.

                                     MARVIN
                         Then you're saying the book's wrong?

                                     FAY
                         Better that than Anna.

               Marvin washes his face some more then looks up.

                                     MARVIN
                         Fay, my god!

               Marvin walks into the room, water dripping off his face, 
               looking like a man who's just seen his own death.

                                     FAY
                         Leo, what? Leo, what is it?

                                     MARVIN
                         I'm going on national television 
                         tomorrow -- to promote a fraud!

               EXT. THE MARVIN PRIVATE DOCK, SAME

               Bob is standing near the end of the diving board holding 
               Siggy by the hips. Siggy is hanging over the water, hands 
               and head down, ready to enter the water diving. Anna is 
               watching. So are the Guttmans.

                                     BOB
                         Don't think about boiling oil!

                                     SIGGY
                         I'm not.

                                     BOB
                         Or searing acid!

                                     SIGGY
                         I'm not!

                                     BOB
                         Our Father, we commit this soul to 
                         the sea.

               Bob gently releases Siggy. Siggy falls into the water, diving. 
               Anna applauds. So do the Guttmans. Siggy resurfaces and throws 
               a jubilant fist in the air.

                                     SIGGY
                         Yeah!

               INT. THE MARVIN BEDROOM, SAME

               Fay holds Marvin's head in her bosom, stroking him.

                                     MARVIN
                         I'm doomed!

                                     FAY
                         No you're not.

                                     MARVIN
                         I'll be a laughing stock!

                                     FAY
                         No you won't. You've blow this way 
                         out of proportion, Leo, and you have 
                         to get control. Now try your 
                         breathing.

                                     MARVIN
                         Okay.
                              (breathes hard)
                         I'm being ridiculous.
                              (more breaths)
                         You're right.

               He walks around breathing exaggeratedly.

                                     MARVIN
                         It's a brilliant book... Our 
                         daughter's fine... I'm great.

                                     FAY
                         That's right.

               Applause from outside can be heard in the room. Fay goes to 
               the window.

                                     MARVIN
                         Fay, do you remember a Carswell 
                         Fensterwald?

                                     FAY
                         My God, Leo, look at this.

                                     MARVIN
                         The name is so familiar but --

                                     FAY
                         Leo, Siggy's diving!

                                     MARVIN
                         What?

               Marvin looks out the window. He sees:

               EXT. THE MARVIN PRIVATE DOCK, SAME. MARVINS' POV

               Bob releases Siggy for another perfect dive.

               BACK TO MARVIN

                                     MARVIN
                         I'll put a stop to this!

               Marvin storms out of the bedroom.

                                     FAY
                         Leo!

               EXT. THE MARVIN DOCK, SAME

               Siggy stands at the end of the board, more confident now, 
               getting ready to do another dive. Bob holds Siggy again but 
               this time Siggy doesn't need much help if any. Marvin charges 
               down the dock, Fay right behind him.

                                     MARVIN
                         Enough. Let go of him! That's enough!

                                     FAY
                         Leo!

                                     BOB
                         Dr. M., watch this!

                                     SIGGY
                              (leaning over to dive)
                         Watch, dad!

                                     MARVIN
                         Stop diving this instant!

                                     ANNA
                         Dad!

               Marvin leaps onto the diving board, shaking it. Bob loses 
               his grip and Siggy falls off the board, doing a back buster. 
               Bob falls in too.

                                     SIGGY
                         Ow!
                              (daggers at Marvin)
                         You bastard!

                                     FAY
                         Leo! Look at what you're doing! Leo, 
                         look at yourself!

               Everybody looks at Marvin, standing alone on the board. He 
               realizes that he's lost all control, something he never does. 
               He looks at the Guttmans.

                                     MARVIN
                         What are you staring at? I had every 
                         right to buy this house!

                                     ANNA
                              (looking in the water)
                         Where's Bob? Where's Bob?!

               Anna and Fay dive into the water. They go under looking for 
               Bob.

               EXT. THE MARVIN HOUSE DECK, AFTERNOON

               Bob is off a bit by himself, wringing out his clothes. Fay, 
               Anna and Siggy sit toweling off. Marvin comes out of the 
               house and talks in low tones to his family.

                                     MARVIN
                         Listen, everybody, I'm not wrong 
                         often, but when I am, I admit it. 
                         I'm sorry. I mean it. How can I make 
                         it up?

               There is a pause. Anna and Siggy and Fay look at each other.

                                     SIGGY
                         Knocking Bob in the water was awful. 
                         What if he hadn't known how to swim?

                                     MARVIN
                         But he did. I'm not saying I was 
                         right, but Bob can do a lot of things 
                         no one thought he could do.

               Anna, Fay and Siggy are silent.

                                     MARVIN
                         Look, I said I was wrong now I'd 
                         like to forget it. I'd like you all 
                         to accept my apology.

                                     ANNA
                         What about Bob?

                                     MARVIN
                         What about Bob?!

                                     ANNA
                         Don't you think you should apologize 
                         to him?

               ANGLE ON BOB

               at the outdoor shower, rinsing off his clothes. He can't 
               hear the family but he can see they're talking about him and 
               he's giving them his best hang-dog looks.

                                     MARVIN
                         I will not apologize to Bob.

                                     ANNA
                         Why not?

                                     MARVIN
                         Because I won't.

                                     FAY
                         Honey, why are you so hostile towards 
                         the poor man?

                                     MARVIN
                         Because he's a patient, Fay! Don't 
                         you get it?

                                     SIGGY
                         He's not a patient, he's a person.

                                     ANNA
                         And a nice one.

                                     FAY
                         I think we should invite him for 
                         dinner.

                                     MARVIN
                         Dinner?!

                                     FAY
                         Dinner.

                                     ANNA
                         Really?!

                                     FAY
                         The poor fellow's devastated.

               Fay heads towards Bob. Marvin turns to her. He keeps his 
               voice low to keep from being heard by Bob, but inside he is 
               about to explode.

                                     MARVIN
                         I don't want Bob for dinner, Fay.

                                     FAY
                         Leo...

                                     MARVIN
                         I don't want Bob for dinner, Fay. I 
                         want to think about my interview.

               Leo is trying not to explode. Fay hangs in the balance.

                                     ANNA
                         Do it, mom. Invite him. You'd be 
                         making family history. It'd be the 
                         first major thing you've done on 
                         your own since I've known you!

                                     FAY
                         Right is right, Leo Marvin.

               Fay heads to Bob. Marvin's mouth falls open.

                                     SIGMUND
                         Testing 1, 2, 3. Testing. For the 
                         next few seconds we will be conducting 
                         a test of the emergency broadcast 
                         system:

               MARVIN SIGGY

               Fay talks to Bob. Anna heads over to him too. Marvin stands 
               speechless, ready to commit hari-kari.

               EXT. THE MARVIN HOUSE PATIO, EVENING

               Dusk has descended over Lake Winnipesaukee. The glow of the 
               moon, the stars, and lights from the other cottages along 
               the lake shore provide peaceful illumination. The Marvin 
               family -- and Bob -- are dining out on their deck overlooking 
               the lake. Marvin sits silent, holding in his anger. Bob, 
               swinging at occasional moths, sits next to Siggy.

                                     BOB
                         Get away. Get away!

                                     SIGGY
                         Ring around the moon. Rain coming 
                         soon.

                                     BOB
                              (edgy to Siggy)
                         Gee, is that true?

                                     MARVIN
                         It's superstitious nonsense.

               Anna and Fay exit the cottage carrying trays of food.

                                     BOB
                              (to Fay and Anna)
                         That looks scrumptious.

               Anna smiles and hands the first plate of food to Bob. Marvin 
               sees this and crosses his arms. He shoots a death stare at 
               Anna. She defiantly shoots it right back. Bob sees this 
               exchange of looks.

                                     BOB
                         Did I do something?

                                     FAY
                         No, Bob. It's fine. Eat up. Leo.

               Fay looks at Marvin and shakes her head "no".

                                     BOB
                              (eating)
                         Mmmm. Mmmmm. This sure is good. Mmmm. 
                         Mmmmm. Mmmmm.

                                     MARVIN
                         Would you please stop that?

                                     BOB
                         Oh. Sorry, Leo. Would you pass the 
                         salt?

                                     MARVIN
                         And don't call me Leo.

                                     BOB
                         I'm sorry. You said in your office 
                         that I could call you Leo.

                                     MARVIN
                         That was in my office. In my home 
                         you will call me Dr. Marvin.

               Marvin snaps the salt down next to Bob. Bob looks helplessly 
               at Fay. Fay puts a hand on Bob's arm.

                                     FAY
                              (low)
                         He's nervous about the interview 
                         tomorrow. Don't take it personally.

                                     BOB
                              (to Marvin)
                         Hey, that's right, I heard about 
                         your upcoming debut. Congratulations.

               Marvin nods and eats. Bob throws salt over his shoulder then 
               salts his food.

                                     BOB
                         Your book's going to do a lot of 
                         people a lot of good, Le-- Dr. Marvin. 
                         I'm walking proof of that.

               Marvin chokes on the food he's eating. Siggy slaps his dad 
               on the back. Marvin keeps coughing.

                                     SIGGY
                         Dad?

                                     FAY
                         Sweetheart?

               Marvin turns red and points to his throat. He falls to the 
               deck on his side. Bob stands.

                                     BOB
                         Don't panic! I know what to do!

               Bob hurries to Marvin, lies beside him, and administers the 
               Heimlick maneuver. On the second try, Marvin's throat clears. 
               Marvin lies in Bob's arms, coughing.

                                     SIGGY
                         Dad, you okay?

                                     ANNA
                         Daddy?!

                                     FAY
                         Honey?!

               Marvin says something. Fay leans over him to hear.

                                     FAY
                         Leo, are you okay?

                                     MARVIN
                         I said..., get him off me!

               Bob lets go of Marvin. Marvin coughs and crawls away.

                                     SIGGY
                         Bob, you saved him!

                                     ANNA
                         Incredible! Wonderful!

                                     FAY
                         Thank you!

               Fay helps Marvin gets to his feet. Suddenly, there is a flash 
               of lightning. Bob jumps. Rain begins to fall. Marvin looks 
               up.

                                     SIGGY
                         Told you so.

               INT. THE MARVIN HOUSE, NIGHT

               The rain outside is coming down in buckets. Marvin is in the 
               living room, re-straightening the furniture and art ever so 
               meticulously. He adjusts a diploma over the mantle. Anna, 
               Fay, Siggy and Bob are in the kitchen, doing the dishes.

                                     BOB
                              (SINGING)
                         "I'm singing in the rain, Just singing 
                         in the rain, What a glorious feeling,

               Bob throws his pack of Kleenex into the trash.

                                     BOB
                              (SINGING)
                         I'm happy again!

               Bob retrieves the pack of Kleenex from the trash.

                                     BOB
                              (SINGING)
                         "I walk though the kitchen With a 
                         bowl full of chicken
                              (puts the chicken in 
                              the fridge)
                         I'm singing, I'm singing In the rain."

               Anna and Fay and Siggy start a dance. Marvin enters.

                                     MARVIN
                         Look, tomorrow morning is very 
                         important and I'd like to call it a 
                         night. I don't want to be rude but I 
                         think it's time for Bob to sing his 
                         way home.

                                     FAY
                              (re: the rain)
                         Honey, you don't expect Bob to walk 
                         back in this do you?

                                     MARVIN
                         Did I say that? I'll drive him.

                                     ANNA
                         The car's still in town, daddy.

                                     MARVIN
                         What?

                                     ANNA
                         You said to leave it, remember? We 
                         walked home.

               Marvin seethes then looks darkly at Anna.

                                     MARVIN
                         The rain's bound to let up. Bob can 
                         go then.

                                     SIGGY
                         What if it starts up again while 
                         Bob's on the way?

                                     MARVIN
                              (nastily)
                         He can borrow my slicker.

               INT. THE MARVIN LIVING ROOM, LATE NIGHT

               Marvin stands staring out the window like he'd like to murder 
               the rain that is still coming down in torrents. Bob is on 
               the couch, sitting alone, wearing Marvin's yellow slicker, 
               looking unwanted. Anna, Siggy and Fay sit quietly, watching 
               Marvin. Bob looks at Fay and shrugs like he's sorry. Fay

                         Quiet. It's letting up.

               There is a crash of thunder that shakes the rafters. Marvin 
               reaches out and slowly scratches the window, creating a tiny 
               squeaking sound. Fay walks to him.

                         Leo, we can't make the poor fellow 
                         sit here all night. Let's let him 
                         stay over.

                                     MARVIN
                         Stay over? Honey, Maria Shriver's 
                         coming in the morning. Maria Shriver! 
                         You want some guy sleeping on our 
                         couch when Maria Shriver gets here?

               He almost laughs at the idea.

                                     FAY
                         There's an extra bed in Siggy's room. 
                         Bob, would you like to spend the 
                         night?

                                     BOB
                         Well I... Do you have a dacron pillow?

                                     SIGGY
                         That's a great idea!

                         Fay!

                                     BOB
                         Are you sure I'm not imposing?

                                     MARVIN
                         Of course you are -- !

                         -- aren't. Anna, find an extra set 
                         of sheets. Siggy, get one of your 
                         father's robes for Bob.

               Fay shoots Marvin a dirty look then exits the room with Anna. 
               Marvin claws the window making a bone chilling squeak.

               INT. SIGGY'S ROOM, NIGHT

               Siggy's room has twin beds arranged head to head against the 
               corner. Bob, wearing one of Marvin's robes, enters. Siggy is 
               hanging up his clothes.

                                     SIGGY
                         Did you find a toothbrush?

                                     BOB
                         Yeah.
                              (belches and hits his 
                              chest)
                         Excuse me.

                                     SIGGY
                         You care which bed?

                                     BOB
                         I'd prefer facing southeast.

               INT. MARVIN'S BEDROOM, SAME

               Marvin enters in his pj's. Fay is preparing for bed.

                                     MARVIN
                         Have you seen my new toothbrush?

                         It should be in the bathroom.

                                     MARVIN
                         Well it should be but it's not!

               Fay shoots Marvin a dirty look then heads towards the 
               bathroom.

                                     FAY
                         Just because you're nervous about

                         can't handle the pressure, postpone

                                     MARVIN
                         Fay, it's not the interview -- I 
                         mean I am nervous about it -- but 
                         that's not what's bugging me. It's... 
                         him.

                         Why shouldn't he hear me? Don't you 
                         get it, he's a sick person. A

                         ...Followed me up here from New York, 
                         wormed his way into my house. For

                                     MARVIN
                         You don't know that! Everything he's 
                         done violates the patient-doctor 
                         relationship. Now he's in there with 
                         our son!

               INT. THE SIGGY'S BEDROOM, NIGHT

               Bob and Siggy lie in Siggy's twin beds. Outside, lightning 
               flashes. Bob chews his nails.

                                     SIGGY
                         Bob?

                                     BOB
                         Yeah.

                                     SIGGY
                         How come you go to dad? Are you really 
                         sick or just maladjusted?

                                     BOB
                         Sick. You ever had a bee buzz your 
                         face that wouldn't go away?

                                     SIGGY
                         Sure. Once or twice.

                                     BOB
                         When I was twelve, I had one buzz me 
                         for three weeks.

               Lightning strikes again. Bob bites his nails. He stands and 
               paces a bit. He notices some books in Siggy's bookcase.

                                     BOB
                         Whoa. You got some heavy stuff here. 
                         Denial of Death, Fear and Trembling, 
                         Sickness Unto Death.

                                     SIGGY
                         Those are dad's.

                                     BOB
                         He lets you read this stuff?

                                     SIGGY
                         He hid them but I found them.

               Bob looks in one, shudders, then puts it back on the shelf.

                                     SIGGY
                         Bob?

                                     BOB
                         Yeah?

                                     SIGGY
                         Are you afraid of death?

                                     BOB
                         Sure. Are you kidding?

                                     SIGGY
                         What do you do about it? I mean, how 
                         do you cope?

                                     BOB
                         Well... The way I figure it, if it 
                         weren't called "death", it wouldn't 
                         be so bad. I mean what if it were 
                         called "dink"?

                                     SIGGY
                         Dink?

                                     BOB
                         Then it would be fine. We'd say 
                         "Grandma dinked." "The garbage man 
                         dinked."

                                     SIGGY
                         My turtle just dinked.

                                     BOB
                         Exactly. Then we wouldn't worry 
                         anymore.

                                     SIGGY
                         Hey, you're right!

                                     BOB
                         'Course we'd still have to worry 
                         about Barrett's Esophagus and Black 
                         Water Fever and Tourette's Syndrome.

                                     SIGGY
                         What's Tourette's syndrome?

               INT. FAY AND MARVIN'S BEDROOM, NIGHT

               Fay and Leo lie near sleep. Suddenly, from the other room, 
               comes a loud barrage of profanity.

                                     SIGGY (O.S.)
                         FART BRAIN!

                                     BOB (O.S.)
                         BOOGER HEAD!

                                     SIGGY (O.S.)
                         DONKEY DICK!

               Fay and Marvin spring out of bed.

               INT. SIGGY'S ROOM, NIGHT

               Bob and Siggy are jumping up and down on their beds, spouting 
               profanity at each other. Marvin and Fay rush in.

                                     MARVIN
                         What is going on in here?!

               Bob and Siggy jump under the covers.

                                     SIGGY
                         Sorry, Dad.

                                     BOB
                         Sorry.

                                     MARVIN
                         I asked you a question!

                                     SIGGY
                         Tourette's Dad. You know, Dad.

                                     BOB
                         Yeah, Dad... Leo... Dr. Marvin.

               Marvin glares at Bob. Fay nudges Marvin.

                                     FAY
                         It's kids being kids, Leo.

                                     MARVIN
                         I don't want to hear another peep 
                         out of this room. I'm trying to get 
                         some sleep around here! Tomorrow is 
                         the most important day of my career! 
                         CBS is coming here. Maria Shriver is

                         watching. And buying!

                                     SIGGY
                         I'm sorry, Dad. We'll stop.

                                     BOB
                         We got carried away. We won't do it 
                         again.

               Marvin stares at Bob.

                                     MARVIN
                         I want you out by six thirty. 
                         Understand. Maria Shriver comes at 
                         seven, I want you out by six thirty.

                                     BOB
                         Sure. Would you like something for 
                         sleep?

                                     MARVIN
                         What?

                                     BOB
                         I've got Valium if you need it.

                                     MARVIN
                         I don't need Valium.

                                     BOB
                         Halcyon? Seconal?

                                     MARVIN
                         I need peace and quiet!

                                     BOB
                         I'll be quiet.

                                     SIGGY
                         And I'll be peace.

               Bob nudges Siggy and they try to contain their laughter. 
               Marvin glares at them then storms out. Fay comes up and tucks 
               them into their beds.

                                     BOB
                         It's my fault, Mrs. M., we should 
                         have been quieter.

                                     FAY
                         We just have to get him through Maria 
                         Shriver. Sleep tight. Don't let the 
                         bed bugs bite.

                                     BOB
                         Bed bugs!

                                     FAY
                         It's just an expression.

                                     BOB
                         Oh right. 'Night.

               She turns out the light and pulls the door closed.

                                     BOB
                         Mrs. M!

               Fay opens the door.

                                     BOB
                         Would you mind leaving it cracked?

               Fay smiles and leaves the door cracked.

               EXT. LONG SHOT OF LAKE WINNIPESAUKEE, EARLY MORNING

               A clearing storm, right after dawn. Three vans from "CBS 
               Morning" wind along the lake towards town.

               EXT. THE SECOND STORY OF THE MARVIN HOUSE, SAME

               Through the window we see Siggy and Bob sound asleep in their 
               beds. DOLLY ACROSS the clapboards to Leo and Fay's room where 
               Fay lies sound asleep and Marvin lies looking at his watch. 
               It lets out a series of beeps and he stands and exits. DOLLY 
               back to Siggy's room where Marvin knocks, loudly.

                                     MARVIN
                         Six o'clock, rise and shine!

               Siggy sits up. Bob doesn't stir. Marvin enters, watch beeping, 
               and walks to Bob. He puts the watch next to Bob's ear.

                                     MARVIN
                         Rise and shine. Six o'clock. Rise 
                         and shine, rise and shine.

               Bob doesn't move. Fay and Anna enter in robes.

                                     MARVIN
                         Bob... Bob!

               He shakes Bob's bed.

                                     MARVIN
                         BOB!

               Bob sleeps through incredible shaking and yelling from a 
               desperate Marvin then suddenly sits up with a start.

                                     BOB
                         AHHHH!

               Everybody leaps back.

               INT. THE MARVIN HOUSEHOLD, EARLY MORNING

               Marvin is in the living room, dressed in his stiffest casuals 
               from L.L. Bean, nervously adjusting his "set". Fay is in the 
               kitchen, preparing food. Momentarily, Bob comes bounding 
               down the stairs.

                                     BOB
                              (more and more rapidly)
                         Baby stepping down the stairs. Baby 
                         stepping down the stairs!

               He turns and sees Marvin.

                                     BOB
                         Hello! Is this a beautiful day or 
                         what?

               Marvin walks to Bob.

                                     MARVIN
                              (gritted teeth)
                         Leave.

                                     BOB
                         I had the most incredible dream last 
                         night, I --

                                     MARVIN
                         Go.

                                     BOB
                         Is this something you want me to 
                         work out on my own?

                                     MARVIN
                         Now!

                                     BOB
                         Well. You've been right about 
                         everything so far. God, therapy is a 
                         fascinating process. 'Bye Mrs. M. 
                         Thank you for everything. 'Bye Anna. 
                         See you later.

                                     ANNA (O.S.)
                         'Bye Bob. See you later today, maybe.

                                     FAY (O.S.)
                         Don't be a stranger.

                                     BOB
                         You know me. I won't.
                              (towards the upstairs)
                         So long, ass wipe of the universe!

                                     SIGGY
                              (coming to the railing 
                              upstairs)
                         'Bye dog pissing barf brain!

                                     MARVIN
                         Siggy! Bob!

               Bob exits out the front door.

                                     BOB (O.S.)
                         Later, fart smelling douche bag!
                              (beat)
                         Maria Shriver's here.

               Marvin turns red in the face. He walks to the door.

               EXT. INT. THE MARVIN HOUSE DOORWAY, SAME

               MARIA SHRIVER and her entourage - PRODUCER, DIRECTOR, video 
               crew, etc. -- approach the door.

                                     MARIA SHRIVER
                         Dr. Marvin, Maria Shriver.

                                     MARVIN
                              (swallows nervously)
                         Hello.

                                     MARIA
                         I hope we're not too early. May we 
                         come in?

               Marvin steps aside. The crew enters with equipment.

                                     MARVIN
                         Sure. I thought by the fireplace...

                                     CREW MEMBER
                         It's a fireplace shot, fellows.

               INT. THE MARVIN SUMMER HOUSE, SAME

               Bob walks to the side screen door, pushes his nose to it and 
               watches. Marvin sees this and motions Bob away with his hand. 
               Bob waves back. Two men approach Marvin.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         I'm the Director, Howie Katrell. 
                         This is Lenny Burns, our Producer.

               Marvin shakes their hands. Maria admires the house.

                                     MARIA
                         This is even nicer than the pictures.

                                     MARVIN
                         Thank you.

                                     MARIA
                         Is this your family?

                                     MARVIN
                         Oh, sorry. This is my wife, er, Fay. 
                         My daughter Anna, and my son...

               Marvin is so nervous, he's forgotten Siggy's name.

                                     SIGGY
                         I'm Siggy, dad. How's Arnold? Can 
                         you get me his autograph?

                                     MARVIN
                         Sigmund...

                                     MARIA
                         I think I can swing it.

                                     SIGGY
                         Really? Wow!

               Maria looks at Bob who is still standing in the screen door.

                                     MARIA
                         Hi. I'm Maria.

                                     BOB
                         I'm Bob.

               He opens the screen door and shakes her hand. This done, 
               Marvin closes the screen door on Bob.

                                     MARVIN
                         Bob's a patient. He was just --

                                     MARIA
                         Wow. A Baby Stepper in action. Neat 
                         idea. Howie, Dr. Marvin's gonna have 
                         a patient on with him.

                                     HOWIE
                         Fine. Let's can the fireplace shot 
                         and --

                                     MARVIN
                         Now wait just a minute!

                                     HOWIE
                         That's okay. We can still use the 
                         fireplace. Phil, what say we set up 
                         over there and...

               Bob opens the screen door and walks back in. Marvin sees 
               this and can't believe it.

                                     MARVIN
                         Ms. Shriver, --

                                     MARIA
                         You know the more I think about this, 
                         Doctor, the more I love it. I mean 
                         who better to testify to the 
                         effectiveness of your book than one 
                         of your patients. I think it's a two 
                         parter, Lenny.

                                     LENNY
                         I do to. Great idea, Dr. Marvin. 
                         Terrific.

               He slaps a disbelieving Marvin on the back.

               INT. THE MARVIN LIVING ROOM, MORNING

               The room is bright lit for TV and the crew is making last 
               minute adjustments. Marvin and Bob sit on the couch, both 
               nervous wrecks, Bob clutching his copy of Baby Steps and an 
               air sickness bag, Marvin clutching a copy of his book. 
               Marvin's diplomas and art are displayed prominently on the 
               "set". The proud family looks on. Fay leans in with a lint 
               roller, rolls Marvin's shirt, kisses him, and backs out.

                                     HOWIE
                         Live feed in ten.

                                     FAY
                         Knock em dead, honey.

                                     LENNY
                         Howie, I don't like that there.

               A crew person rushes up and takes down Marvin's diploma.

                                     HOWIE
                         Five -- four -- three --

                                     BOB
                         Can I use the bathroom?

               Howie points at Maria.

                                     MARIA
                              (TO TV CAMERA)
                         Good Morning. We're live in the 
                         beautiful Lake Winnipesaukee summer 
                         home of Dr. Leo M. Marvin, author of 
                         the newest sensation in therapy, 
                         Baby Steps. Also with us is Dr. 
                         Marvin's patient, Bob Wiley. Good 
                         morning, Dr. Marvin. Bob.

                                     BOB AND MARVIN
                              (SIMULTANEOUSLY)
                         Good morning.

               Marvin shoots Bob a dirty look. Bob smiles innocently. 
               Suddenly Bob takes out his air sickness bag and holds it out 
               as if to throw up in it. After a long beat, Bob puts it back.

                                     BOB
                         False alarm. Sorry.

               Bob smiles. Marvin turns beet red.

                                     MARIA
                         Dr. Marvin, it takes a remarkable 
                         amount of confidence in your methods 
                         to bring on a patient with you. What 
                         in particular about Bob's prior 
                         condition would you like to share 
                         with us?

               Marvin looks at Bob. A tiny, sadistic smile comes across his 
               face. There are a million things he'd like to say about Bob -- 
               to humiliate him, punish him, discredit him, ridicule him, 
               vilify him, pillory him -- on national TV.

                                     MARVIN
                         Nothing.

                                     MARIA
                         Nothing? Nothing in particular you 
                         think we should know?

                                     MARVIN
                         No.

                                     MARIA
                         Hum... Well...
                              (pause)
                         Let me try you, Bob.

               She smiles at Bob. Bob takes out his air sickness bag again. 
               He holds it for a long time then puts it away. He smiles.

                                     BOB
                         Okay.

                                     MARIA
                         Have you been a patient of Dr. 
                         Marvin's for a long time?

                                     BOB
                         Long time? I wouldn't call it a long 
                         time.
                              (looking at Marvin)
                         What? Three or four days?

                                     MARIA
                         Days?!

               INT. A DINGY ROOM IN A DOWNTOWN URBAN SPRAWL, SAME

               Carswell Fensterwald sits watching Marvin and Bob on TV. 
               Marvin is a bumbling wreck, trying to save this one.

                                     MARVIN
                              (ON TV)
                         Well... you see... I was..., he was... 
                         I was..., following his case 
                         through..., another psychiatrist... 
                         He thought I was, er, the perfect 
                         doctor for the case. Because of my 
                         book.

                                     MARIA
                              (ON TV)
                         Ah.

                                     BOB
                         Why you sly dogs, he was right! I 
                         want to say that if more wisdom, or 
                         more empathy, or more pure 
                         intelligence exists than exits in 
                         this man, I want to know about it. 
                         Do you know that he actually had me 
                         sleep here last night? In his jamies, 
                         using his toothbrush!

                                     MARIA
                              (ON TV)
                         That's a very unusual technique.

               Fensterwald pounds his chair and howls with glee.

               BACK TO MARVIN'S HOUSE LIVING ROOM, SAME

                                     MARVIN
                         Well --

                                     BOB
                         I'll say and I've been to them all. 
                         Doctors who made you beat pillows.

               He demonstrates by beating a couch pillow.

                                     BOB
                         Doctors who make you scream.

               Bob suddenly screams. Marvin jumps.

                                     BOB
                         But this doctor has something simple. 
                         Baby Steps.

               Bob holds up Baby Steps then stands and walks back and forth 
               in front of Marvin. He holds the book so that it can be seen 
               by the TV camera.

                                     BOB
                         Baby step across the room. Baby step 
                         across the room...

               He leans and looks into the TV camera.

                                     BOB
                         Are you getting the book?

               Bob plops back on the couch.

                                     BOB
                         Let me tell you what I used to be 
                         like before I met Dr M.

               Bob puts his arm around Marvin.

                                     BOB
                         Eleven years ago I was not the man 
                         you see today. Eleven years ago...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. THE MARVIN HOUSE, MORNING

               The CBS vans are loading up. Maria, Lenny and Howie stand at 
               the door saying good-by. Marvin hovers in the background, in 
               shock.

                                     MARIA
                         Bob, that stuff about yourself was 
                         refreshingly honest. Could we talk 
                         to you again in a few months to update 
                         your progress?

                                     BOB
                         Sure. As long as my doctor gives 
                         permission.

               Marvin tries to force a smile but can't. A CBS staff 
               photographer comes over, places Bob and Maria in his frame 
               and snaps a picture. The CBS people head off.

                                     MARIA
                         Thank you for your hospitality, Mrs. 
                         Marvin.

                                     FAY
                         Anytime!

               Maria and CBS leave.

               INT. THE MARVIN HOUSE LIVING ROOM, SAME

               The family and Bob move back into the house. Looking like a 
               zombie, Leo closes the door. He stands still for a long 
               moment.

                                     MARVIN
                         I'm... ruined!

                                     FAY
                         Ruined?

                                     MARVIN
                         My career... Everything I've worked 
                         for..., over!

               Marvin ambles across the room like a cripple. The family 
               watches in shock.

                                     ANNA
                         But daddy...

               Suddenly Marvin turns on Bob.

                                     MARVIN
                         Get out.

                                     BOB
                         Is it something, I said?

               Marvin moves at Bob, backing him towards the front door.

                                     MARVIN
                         GET OUT!!

               Seeing Marvin's rage, Bob backs out and Marvin closes the 
               door. After a moment there's a knock. Marvin opens it.

                                     BOB
                         Is this aversion therapy?

                                     MARVIN
                         GO AWAY NOW!

                                     BOB
                         Okay.

               Marvin slams the door again. The family is stunned.

                                     FAY
                         My god, Leo, what's got into you?

                                     SIGGY
                         Dad, you're over reacting. What about 
                         Bob?

               EXT. THE CRIS CRAFT BOAT, DAY

               The doctors and their wives sit rapt, listening to Doctor 3.

                                     WIFE
                         Yeah, what about Bob?

                                     ANOTHER DOCTOR
                         What about Bob?

               INT. THE MARVIN HOUSE LIVING ROOM, DAY

                                     MARVIN
                         WHAT ABOUT BOB?!

                                     SIGGY
                         Dad...

                                     ANNA
                         Daddy, look at your behavior. What 
                         are you doing?

                                     MARVIN
                         What am I doing? What am I doing?!

               He strides across the room. He finds his electronic organizer, 
               opens it, and pushes buttons.

                                     MARVIN
                         Wednesday... Afternoon...

               He holds out the organizer for family to see the readout.

                                     MARVIN
                         I'm going sailing!

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               EXT. THE COUNTRY ROAD, DAY

               Bob walks down the road, upset, talking to himself.

                                     BOB
                         The fam is hurt. I've hurt them. I 
                         didn't mean to. Certainly they realize 
                         that. I've hurt the fam. Hurt the 
                         fam. I've hurt the fam.

               The Marvin station wagon, Marvin driving, passes. Bob sees 
               Fay, Siggy, and Anna turn and wave.

                                     BOB
                         Hi fam!
                              (pause)
                         Bye fam!

               The car speeds on.

                                     BOB
                         I hurt the fam.

               EXT. THE WINNIPESAUKEE PIER, DAY

               Marvin's family climbs aboard a small sailboat. Marvin pulls 
               a line onto the deck, then the boat glides out into the lake.

               EXT. WINNIPESAUKEE TOWN, FILLED WITH VACATIONERS, SAME

               Bob wanders, looking lost, mumbling.

                                     BOB
                         I could apologize. But then I'd have 
                         to go back and I'm not sure they 
                         want me. I hurt the fam. That much I 
                         know. Hurt the fam.

                                     VENDOR (O.S.)
                         Hot dog, bub?

               Bob looks idly up. A VENDOR with a cart is talking to Bob.

                                     BOB
                              (distracted)
                         Sure.

               The VENDOR hands Bob a hot dog. Bob hands him money then 
               wanders off.

               NEW ANGLE, A BUSY GREEN BESIDE THE PIER, DAY

               Families of tourists stroll. Bob stands staring dejectedly 
               out at the lake. Unthinkingly, he takes a bite of the hot 
               dog then turns.

                                     BOB
                         This has to be some kind of test. I 
                         know I hurt them but they have to 
                         know I didn't mean it. If it's a 
                         test... I ate a hot dog.

               Bob stares at the hot dog like it just spoke Greek.

                                     BOB
                         I ATE A HOT DOG!

               The tourists turn and stare.

               EXT. LAKE WINNIPESAUKEE, SAME

               Marvin stands at the helm, sailing the small sailboat across 
               lake. The breeze blows Marvin's hair, making him look wild. 
               Anna suns. Siggy casts a fishing line. Fay stares into 
               nowhere.

                                     MARVIN
                         I mean it's summer time right, what 
                         could their audience be, five million? 
                         Most of them hardly pay attention 
                         anyway, right? The point is, the 
                         book got on. It couldn't hurt sales, 
                         that much could it?

                                     FAY
                         Of course not.

                                     MARVIN
                         I mean... It's a disaster, Fay!

                         Hey, look. Isn't that Bob?

               Off the bow, a small motorboat is approaching.

               ANGLE ON THE MOTORBOAT, SAME

               Bob is steering a small motorboat towards the sailboat. He 
               holds half of his hot dog out like a trophy.

                                     BOB
                         Dr. M! Dr. M., I've had a 
                         breakthrough! I ate a hot dog! I'm 
                         driving a boat! Thanks to you!

                                     MARVIN
                         Oh no.

                                     SIGGY
                         Hey, Bob!

               Anna and Siggy wave. Marvin's eyes narrow. Bob keeps shouting 
               as he motors closer.

                                     BOB
                         I'm really making progress now! I 
                         feel like a whole new world is opening 
                         up!

               He keeps getting closer.

                                     BOB
                         My childhood memories are rushing 
                         over me like a flood!

               Marvin turns the rudder and comes about.

                                     MARVIN
                         Coming about!

               He turns the sailboat and heads the opposite direction from 
               Bob.

                                     ANNA
                         Daddy, what are you doing?

                                     MARVIN
                              (at Bob's boat)
                         Go away!

                                     BOB
                         What?

                                     ANNA
                         Daddy, he's trying to talk to you.

                                     SIGGY
                         Dad...

               Marvin keeps sailing away. But Bob's boat is faster and it's 
               gaining. Marvin sees this, jerks the rudder again, and turns 
               ninety degrees. He stands and shouts at Bob.

                                     MARVIN
                         Go away, do you hear me!!

                                     FAY
                         Leo, the boom!

               The boom hits Marvin square in the chest, and knocks him 
               overboard.

                                     ANNA, FAY, SIGGY
                         Daddy! Leo! Dad!

               EXT. THE WATER, LAKE LEVEL, SAME

               Marvin bobs in the water. The pilotless sailboat heels away. 
               Bob dives in, swims to Marvin, and grabs him by the chin in 
               a traditional life-saver hold. As Siggy gains control of the 
               sailboat, Bob begins doing the side stroke towards the distant 
               shore with Marvin in tow.

                                     BOB
                         I never had a father, really. Dad 
                         left one morning and never came back. 
                         My earliest memory is mom with a 
                         suitcase. Do you think that's 
                         significant?

               Marvin is a prisoner in tow. He drags himself under water. 
               Bob pulls him up and keeps swimming.

                                     BOB
                         I'd like to do some free association 
                         about my infancy: A beachball. A 
                         dog. A frog. A log. Poodle, noodle, 
                         doodle...

               As Bob swims Marvin towards the shore, going on and on with 
               this inane free association...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. THE MARVIN HOUSE, AFTERNOON

               Marvin, dry and dressed now, exits the house and gets in the 
               station wagon. He honks. Momentarily Bob runs out.

                                     BOB
                              (at the house)
                         Will do!

               Bob gets in the car. Affectless, Marvin stares at him.

                                     BOB
                         Wherever we're going, Fay wants us 
                         home by seven.

                                     MARVIN
                         No problem.

               Marvin accelerates away, rudely.

               EXT./INT. THE MARVIN STATION WAGON, DAY

               Rain is falling. The wipers swish. Marvin drives through 
               pastoral New Hampshire countryside focused, perhaps too 
               intently, on the road. Bob sits beside him.

                                     BOB
                         It's a combustible relationship, 
                         isn't it? Is it just you and me or 
                         is it you and everybody?
                              (pause)
                         So what's the big surprise?

                                     MARVIN
                         Intensive psychotherapy.

                                     BOB
                         Really?!

                                     MARVIN
                         Isn't that what you came here for?

                                     BOB
                         Yeah! But what brought this on now?

                                     MARVIN
                         You're ready.

                                     BOB
                         Wow. This is exciting.

               EXT. THE TOMSKY CONVALESCENT HOME, DAY

               The rain has let up. Marvin pulls up to a gated estate 
               sporting expansive grounds and a hotel sized main building. 
               Marvin stops at a guard gate.

                                     MARVIN
                         Leo Marvin to see Dr. Tomsky.

               The GATE GUARD checks a list. He waves Marvin through. GATE 
               GUARD Main building doctor. They're expecting you.

                                     BOB
                         Where are we?

                                     MARVIN
                         Therapy land, Bob. A twentieth century 
                         theme park of the mind.

               They drive.

                                     MARVIN
                         The lines look short today.

               EXT. THE TOMSKY CONVALESCENT HOME, SAME

               Marvin gets out and so does Bob. A man Leo's age, DR. TOMSKY, 
               approaches.

                                     DR. TOMSKY
                         Hello, Leo. Long time no see! Is 
                         this our friend?

                                     MARVIN
                         Bob Wiley, this is your new pal, Dr. 
                         Tomsky.

                                     BOB
                         New pal? What's wrong with my old 
                         pal?

               Tomsky makes a motion of his head. Two big attendants move 
               to either side of Bob.

                                     BIG ATTENDANT 1
                         Let us show you to your room.

               They lead Bob off.

                                     BOB
                         Hey! Don't touch me! I have seizures! 
                         Dr. M! Dr. M!!

               They take Bob into a building. Marvin turns to Tomsky.

                                     MARVIN
                         I really appreciate your helping me 
                         out on this, Kenneth.

               Tomsky holds out a form for Marvin to sign. He does.

                                     TOMSKY
                         I can only hold him for twenty four 
                         hours, Leo. Without staff 
                         corroboration.

                                     MARVIN
                         I'm not worried in the least, Kenneth. 
                         I'm sure your entire staff will 
                         corroborate. With intensive treatment 
                         he should be out in about -- fifty 
                         years.

               Marvin hands the clipboard back to Tomsky. They shake.

               EXT. THE MARVIN HOUSE DRIVEWAY, LATE AFTERNOON

               The Marvin station wagon pulls into the driveway, radio is 
               blasting, playing a tape of Neil Diamond. Marvin exits it, 
               dancing as he sings along.

                                     MARVIN AND TAPE
                         "I'll be what I am, solitary man. 
                         SOLITARY MAN!"

               INT. THE MARVIN SUMMER HOUSE, SAME

               Marvin enters singing. Siggy and Anna see him.

                                     ANNA
                         Dad, you okay?

                                     MARVIN
                              (to "Oklahoma")
                         "Okay, Anna Mae, Leo Marvin's okay 
                         Leo Marvin, he's okay!"

                                     SIGGY
                         Where's Bob?

                                     ANNA
                         Yeah, dad, where's Bob?

                                     MARVIN
                         Can't a man enjoy himself on vacation?

                                     ANNA
                         Dad -- ?

                                     MARVIN
                         Bob sends his regrets but he had to 
                         take a trip.

                                     ANNA
                         What kind of trip? I thought you 
                         were working with him.

                                     MARVIN
                         I was.

                                     ANNA
                         Then why'd he go on a trip?

                                     MARVIN
                         Why does a man climb a mountain, 
                         Anna? Because it's there.

               Marvin turns up the music and dances. Anna and Siggy stand 
               stunned.

                                     ANNA
                         He didn't even say good-bye?

                                     SIGGY
                         He just left?

                                     ANNA
                         It's not like Bob not to say good-
                         bye.

                                     MARVIN
                         That's why he left, you see. He just 
                         wasn't himself.
                              (pause)
                         He'll write.

                                     ANNA
                         Dad, if you did something to Bob...

                                     MARVIN
                         Anna, what do you take me for?
                              (pause)
                         Everything's fine.

               Marvin, looking perfectly content, turns off the music, goes 
               to his chair, picks up Freud's Understanding Dreams, the 
               book he's been trying to read since he arrived here. Siggy 
               and Anna stare at him suspiciously. Fay enters carrying the 
               cordless phone.

                                     FAY
                         Leo, a Dr. Tomsky says it's urgent.

               Marvin takes the phone and walks into the kitchen. Anna and 
               Siggy look even more suspicious. Momentarily Leo strides out 
               of the kitchen and walks out the front door.

                                     FAY
                         Leo, where are you going?

                                     MARVIN
                         Out.

                                     FAY
                         Just like that?
                              (pause)
                         Be home by seven, okay?

               Marvin doesn't answer because he's gone.

                                     ANNA
                         Something's rotten in Winnipesaukee.

               EXT. THE TOMSKY CONVALESCENT HOME, LATE AFTERNOON

               Marvin's car screeches up. Marvin hurries out.

               INT. THE TOMSKY CONVALESCENT HOME, SAME

               Bob sits around a table with Tomsky and several members of 
               the STAFF who are laughing.

                                     BOB
                         Wait, I've another one. Who knows 
                         the difference between Freud and 
                         Moses?

               He sees blank, expectant faces, waiting for a punchline.

                                     BOB
                         Well if you don't know, I'm going to 
                         another clinic!

               All laugh. Tomsky sees Marvin enter and stands.

                                     TOMSKY
                         Excuse me.

                                     BOB
                         So a psychiatrist and a psychologist 
                         go into a bar and order Bloody 
                         Marys...

               INT. THE TOMSKY CONVALESCENT HOME HALLWAY, SAME

               Tomsky joins Marvin in the hall. In the other room we see 
               Bob continuing to joke with the staff.

                                     MARVIN
                         Kenneth, you have been duped by a 
                         textbook narcissist. A brilliant 
                         neuropath!

                                     TOMSKY
                         Brilliant enough to dupe my entire 
                         staff? I doubt that.

               Tomsky stuffs a paper into Marvin's shirt pocket.

                                     TOMSKY
                         I'm giving you back his admitting 
                         forms, Leo, to save you any 
                         embarrassment.

                                     MARVIN
                         Embarrassment?!

                                     TOMSKY
                         It's perfectly natural for a patient 
                         to bond with his analyst. It's a 
                         normal part of therapy. If you want 
                         to be rid of him, simply take him 
                         back where you got him and go home.

                                     MARVIN
                         That's easy for you to say! He's 
                         human crazy glue! If it were that 
                         simple do you think I'd be here?

                                     TOMSKY
                         You should have never let him sleep 
                         in your pajamas, Leo. His problems 
                         don't go away just because you want 
                         them too.

                                     MARVIN
                         Whose side are you on?!

                                     TOMSKY
                         Relax, Leo.

                                     MARVIN
                         I'm relaxed!

                                     TOMSKY
                         Take a vacation.

                                     MARVIN
                         I'm on vacation!!

                                     TOMSKY
                         Are you sure? Maybe you should check 
                         in here for a few days and get a 
                         handle on things?

               Marvin looks at Tomsky, amazed at the implication of this 
               statement.

               EXT. THE COUNTRYSIDE OF NEW ENGLAND, DAY

               Marvin drives. Bob rides. Marvin looks ready to explode.

                                     BOB
                         Intensive psychotherapy? -- boy, you 
                         weren't kidding, were you? I mean 
                         even Dr. T. didn't think I needed 
                         that.
                              (pause)
                         Look I have an idea -- how are your 
                         afternoons? I mean since we're here 
                         together with nothing else to do, 
                         what say we work from two to four, 
                         something like that?

               EXT. THE COUNTRY ROAD, SAME

               The Marvinmobile screeches to a halt and Marvin jumps out. 
               He rushes around the car and opens Bob's door.

                                     MARVIN
                         Get out! Get out of my car, get out 
                         of my life, don't ever come back!

               Marvin drags Bob out of the car and slams the door.

                                     BOB
                         Are you saying you'd prefer mornings?

               Marvin gets back in and floors it. He speeds off.

                                     BOB
                         What is this, isolation therapy?

               Bob stands alone on the road.

                                     BOB
                         You're the doctor.

               Birds chirp and crickets crick. A pick-up truck passes and 
               Bob sticks out his thumb. The pick-up stops.

               INT. MARVIN'S CAR, SAME

               Marvin is about to bust a vessel. Telephone poles shoot by 
               like pickets on a fence. Behind him a siren wails. In his 
               rear-view mirror, Marvin sees a motorcycle cop approaching.

                                     MARVIN
                         No! You won't catch me!! NO!

               EXT. THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, ANOTHER SPOT, LATER

               The motorcycle cop is writing a steaming Leo Marvin a ticket. 
               A passing pick-up slows and Bob leans out the passenger 
               window.

                                     BOB
                         Need any help?

                                     MARVIN
                         No!

                                     BOB
                         Remember: be home by seven.

               The pick-up drives on. The motorcycle cop hands Marvin a 
               ticket. Marvin gets back into his car, throws it in gear, 
               and the car jerks backwards into the guardrail.

                                     MARVIN
                         Shit!

               Marvin throws it into forward. The car, fender dented, tears 
               away.

               EXT. THE PORCH OF A COUNTRY HOUSE, LATE AFTERNOON

               Sitting on the porch of his house, an OLD MAN watches as 
               Marvin's car slows to a stop out in the road. The tire under 
               the dented fender is torn to ribbons by the metal and the 
               car is now riding on the rim. Marvin stops, gets out of the 
               car, and looks at the tire.

                                     MARVIN
                         First he ruins my life, now he ruins 
                         my tire!

               Cursing to himself, Marvin walks to the trunk and removes a 
               jack.

                                     MARVIN
                         God! Damn! Son of a bitching! Bob!

               A WOMAN comes out of the house and joins the old man. They 
               watch in silence as Marvin jacks up his car. As he twists 
               and grimaces and kicks to get off the lug nuts, it starts to 
               RAIN.

                                     MARVIN
                         Shit piss crap! Son of a bitching 
                         douche bag asshole!

               THREE MORE PEOPLE come out on the porch and watch. As Marvin 
               struggles, the car slips off the jack and slams to the 
               pavement. Marvin begins kicking the tire and hitting it with 
               the jack.

                                     MARVIN
                         What about Bob?! Think about Bob! 
                         What about Bob? What about Bob? WHAT 
                         ABOUT BOB!!

               EXT. THE MARVIN HOUSE, DUSK

               Mumbling to himself, soaking wet, and filthy with tire grime, 
               Marvin walks to his house. He kicks open the front door.

                                     MARVIN
                         I'm home!

               INT. THE MARVIN HOUSE, DUSK. MARVIN'S P.O.V.

               Lights go on. Thirty people stand around the room with party 
               favors and drinks. In unison they yell:

                                     PARTY GUESTS
                         Surprise!
                              (then sing:)
                         "Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday 
                         to you! Happy Birthd...

               The singing tapers into silence. Flabbergasted by Marvin's 
               disheveled appearance, the party guests stare. Fay and the 
               kids approach, tentatively.

                                     SIGGY
                         Dad, what happened?

                                     MARVIN
                         Nothing.

                                     FAY
                         Leo, look at yourself!

                                     MARVIN
                         Just a little car trouble, hon. I'm 
                         fine.

               Fay is speechless. So are Siggy and Anna. Not wanting to let 
               things sink, party-hardy well-wishers approach Leo.

                                     PARTY GUEST 1
                         Happy Birthday, Leo.

                                     PARTY GUEST 2
                         Some night to have car trouble. You 
                         almost missed your own surprise party!

                                     BOB (O.S.)
                         Happy Birthday, Dr. M!

               Marvin turns and stares at Bob.

                                     BOB
                         I couldn't miss your birthday!

               Marvin suddenly leaps at Bob and grabs him by the throat. He 
               pushes him through three rooms of the house, choking him.

                                     MARVIN
                         I want you dead! Dead, you hear me, 
                         dead!

               Marvin falls on the floor on top of Bob. Guests go to pull 
               him off.

               INT. THE MARVIN BEDROOM, NIGHT

               Marvin lies in bed in the darkened room. He can hear the 
               party guests huddle outside in the hall, whispering. A guest 
               whom we recognize as the Doctor 3 from the boat, (the man 
               who is telling this story), enters carrying his doctor's 
               bag. He approaches Fay who is wringing her hands. Both speak 
               in whispers loud enough for Marvin to decipher.

                                     FAY
                         I've never seen him like this, Phil. 
                         He's got this delusion about Bob 
                         Wiley being the cause of all his 
                         problems and I don't know what to 
                         do.

                                     PHIL
                         He's under a lot of stress, Fay. His 
                         book, his interview which frankly 
                         didn't go so well, his birthday. 
                         That's a lot to bite off all at once. 
                         I'll give him a sedative and he'll 
                         be fine.

                                     FAY
                         You really think so?

               Phil puts a hand on Fay's hand and nods.

               INT. THE MARVIN LIVING ROOM, NIGHT

               Bob sits on the couch beside Siggy. Anna approaches.

                                     ANNA
                         You feeling better?

                                     BOB
                         I'm fine. It's your dad I'm worried 
                         about. How is he?

                                     ANNA
                         Upstairs. Resting. I can't understand 
                         why he'd attack you like that.

               Anna sits next to Bob. Bob sees George Stark, standing across 
               the room, smiling at Anna.

                                     BOB
                         I can't either. But one thing I've 
                         learned about psychiatrists: they're 
                         brilliant manipulators. I trust your 
                         dad completely. I'm sure everything 
                         he's done has been to help me.
                              (pause)
                         How come you aren't making a move on 
                         George Stark?

                                     ANNA
                              (glancing at George)
                         Bob, we've talked about this.

                                     BOB
                         No, you've talked about it and I've 
                         listened. In my opinion, George 
                         Stark's smile is not Oedipal 
                         regression and it's not confused 
                         libido. It's one good looking guy 
                         drooling over you, Anna Marvin.

                                     ANNA
                         Bob...

                                     BOB
                         Go ask if you can put your tongue in 
                         his mouth. I hear it works every 
                         time.

               Anna smiles then summons her courage, and smilingly approaches 
               George. He is clearly delighted. A woman walks up to Bob.

                                     WOMAN (LILY)
                         Hi. Fay said to introduce myself. 
                         I'm Lily, Leo's neurotic sister.

               We saw LILY MARVIN'S picture in Leo's office. Bob stands, 
               delighted.

                                     BOB
                         A pleasure. I'm neurotic too.

                                     LILY
                         Really, what a coincidence. Am I 
                         disturbing you?

                                     BOB
                         Only in a good way. Sit down.

               She does.

                                     BOB
                         It must be nice having an analyst in 
                         the family.

                                     LILY
                         I don't know, ask Leo. I'm an analyst 
                         too.

                                     BOB
                         You're kidding?!

               INT. MARVIN'S DARKENED BEDROOM, NIGHT

               Phil empties a large syringe into Marvin's buttock. He swats 
               Marvin's behind and Marvin pulls up his pj's.

                                     PHIL
                         That should give you some interesting 
                         ideas for your next book. You might 
                         even wake up feeling happy.

                                     MARVIN
                         I doubt it. Phil, do you remember a 
                         classmate named Fensterwald?

                                     PHIL
                         Carswell Fensterwald? Sure. Who could 
                         forget?

                                     MARVIN
                         I've forgotten and I don't know why. 
                         Did anything unusual happen with 
                         him?

                                     PHIL
                         You're joking.

                                     MARVIN
                         Do I act like a man who's joking?!

                                     PHIL
                         Relax, Leo. I just can't believe 
                         you'd block something like that out. 
                         Carswell was at Harvard with us. You 
                         turned him in for cheating.

                                     MARVIN
                         What...?

                                     PHIL
                         Don't you remember? You brought action 
                         against him for stealing your 
                         psychoanalysis notes and they booted 
                         him. The only place that would take 
                         him after that was University of 
                         Guadalajara.

               Marvin tries to speak but nothing comes out of his mouth. 
               Tomsky watches with concern.

                                     TOMKSY
                         Leo, is there something about Carswell 
                         that's disturbing you? Leo...?

                                     MARVIN
                         Thanks, Phil. Enjoy the party.

               Phil lingers then leaves, closing the door. Marvin begins 
               shaking all over. As he does the bed rattles rapidly against 
               the wall. Leo's losing it. He's no longer the same sane man. 
               In the darkness we hear:

                                     MARVIN
                         Baby steps, make a plan.

               INT. MARVIN'S BEDROOM, THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

               Fay sleeps soundly next to Marvin who is wide eyed, staring 
               at the ceiling, twitching. Marvin pulls himself carefully 
               out of bed and crawls on the floor to the door.

               EXT. THE MARVIN HOUSE, SAME

               Marvin, carrying his shoes, crawls outside. He tries to put 
               his shoes on and falls flat on his face. He then pulls himself 
               up and hobbles away.

               EXT. THE WINNIPESAUKEE GENERAL STORE, MORNING

               This is where the Marvin family was shopping when Bob first 
               came to town. Marvin paces outside until the owner opens the 
               front door for business.

               INT. THE GENERAL STORE, MORNING

               Marvin wanders through the hardware section, looking around. 
               FRED, the owner, works behind the counter.

                                     FRED
                         Can I help you, doctor?

                                     MARVIN
                         I want to buy a gun.

                                     FRED
                         Okay.

               Fred walks to a case.

                                     FRED
                         I've got Winchesters. Colts. What do 
                         you plan on hunting?

                                     MARVIN
                         Er. An animal. This tall. Hundred 
                         and seventy pounds. Bermuda shorts.

                                     FRED
                         Take a look at this baby. It'll shoot 
                         through anything but it also leaves 
                         a clean wound.

               He hands Marvin a rifle. Marvin examines it.

                                     FRED
                         Your wife was in with that Bob fellow. 
                         Sure is a nice guy.

                                     MARVIN
                              (handing back the 
                              rifle)
                         What do you have that leaves a messy 
                         wound?

               ANGLE ON THE CASH REGISTER AREA

               Fred is ringing up Marvin's purchase: two rifles and a box 
               of shells.

                                     FRED
                         I'll need you driver's license, social 
                         security number, and you can pick 
                         them up on Friday...
                              (checks a calendar)
                         the 18th.

                                     MARVIN
                         The eighteenth?

                                     FRED
                         There's a two week waiting period in 
                         this state.

                                     MARVIN
                         I can't wait two weeks! I need these 
                         now!

               He grabs the rifles. Fred keeps a firm grip on them.

                                     FRED
                         Dr. Marvin, it's the law.

               Fred wins the tug-of-war. Marvin stares at him.

                                     MARVIN
                         What about explosives? Any waiting 
                         period there?

               EXT. BOB'S COTTAGE, MORNING

               Marvin, carrying a bag and singing to himself, walks up to 
               the cottage. He looks around then kicks open the door.

               INT. BOB'S COTTAGE, MORNING

               The place looks completely anonymous except for Gil in a 
               bowl and Bob's bag of clothes. Marvin sits on the floor, 
               filling a pair of milk cartons with gray powder.

                                     MARVIN
                              (singing)
                         "Bob fell in to a Burning ring of 
                         fire. He went down down down And the 
                         flames went higher. And it burned 
                         burned burned, That ring of fire. 
                         The ring of fire."

               Marvin removes a wired mechanism from the bag and a timer. 
               He delicately pushes the wires into the milk cartons then 
               carefully ties on some fuse wires. He puts the milk cartons 
               and wired mechanisms into a BACKPACK and puts it under Bob's 
               bed. He begins laying the fuse wire along the floor towards 
               the door.

               Marvin passed Gil, sitting on a table. Marvin picks up the 
               bowl and puts it under the bed next to the bomb. He then 
               goes back to laying the wire into the kitchenette.

               EXT. BOB'S COTTAGE, SAME

               Marvin lays the fuse wire across room and out the door. He 
               closes the door and starts to set the timer when he spots a 
               note hanging on the nearby mailbox:

                                     MARVIN
                              (reading aloud)
                         "Dear Mr. and Mrs. G., If I'm not 
                         here, I'm at the Marvins. Would you 
                         feed Gil? Thanks. Bob. P.S. Your 
                         denture adhesives arrived so I put 
                         them in your mailbox. Enjoy. Bob. "

               Marvin seethes. He thinks a moment then heads back into the 
               cottage. Momentarily he returns carrying the back pack and 
               the long wire fuse.

               INT. THE MARVIN HOUSE, DAY

               Bob, Anna and Siggy sit around watching Fay on the phone.

                                     FAY
                         Well if you hear from him, Donna, 
                         please call... Thanks.

               She hangs up.

                                     FAY
                         Nobody's seen him.

               She stands and gets her purse off the table.

                                     FAY
                         I'm going looking for him.

                                     ANNA
                         Me too.

                                     SIGGY
                         Me too.

                                     BOB
                         Me too.

                                     ANNA
                         Shouldn't somebody stay here in case 
                         he comes back?

                                     SIGGY
                         I'll stay.

                                     BOB
                         I'll stay.

                                     FAY
                         We'll leave him a note.

               She pauses then stops in front of Bob.

                                     FAY
                         Bob, I'm not defending Leo's recent 
                         behavior in any way, so please don't 
                         take this personally. However 
                         irrational the reasons, Leo is so 
                         upset with you that I think it would 
                         be best if you weren't around when 
                         he comes back.

                                     BOB
                         Really?

                                     SIGGY
                         Yeah, mom. Why?

                                     FAY
                         Because I say so, Siggy.
                              (to Bob)
                         Please don't think it's the way I 
                         want it. It's just that Leo's not 
                         himself.

                                     SIGGY
                         It's not Bob's fault.

                                     BOB
                         Listen to your mom, Siggy. All of 
                         you get out of here, okay? I'll 
                         straighten up before I go and when 
                         Dr. M. comes home, everything will 
                         be exactly the way he likes it.

                                     FAY
                         Bob you're such a dear. Take good 
                         care, all right?

               Fay hugs Bob. So does Anna.

                                     BOB
                         You give George a chance okay?

               Anna nods. Bob turns to Siggy who is upset. Bob holds out 
               his hand.

                                     BOB
                         Give me leather, ass wiping bastard 
                         head.

               Siggy swats Bob's hand.

                                     SIGGY
                         Green puking piss-ant.

               The family and Bob exchange pregnant good-bye looks, then 
               Fay and Siggy and Anna exit.

                                     BOB
                         Bye, fam.

               NEW ANGLE, OUT THE LIVING ROOM WINDOW, SAME

               Bob watches as the Marvin family walks away. They wave. Bob 
               waves back, sadly. He shuffles across the room. He stops at 
               the puppets on the mantle.

                                     BOB
                         I guess this is good-bye, fam.

               Bob shuffles to Marvin's chair. He stares at the book Marvin 
               has been trying to read, Freud's Understanding Dreams then 
               casually opens it. He reads for a moment, gets interested in 
               it and sits down. He sits back in Marvin's chair, reading.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. THE MARVIN HOUSE, LATER

               Bob is asleep in Marvin's chair, Freud's Understanding Dreams 
               open on his chest. Suddenly Marvin's face pops up at the 
               window. He looks in, sees Bob, then ducks back down. 
               Momentarily, the front door to the cottage is kicked open 
               and there stands a seething Marvin.

                                     MARVIN
                         Get up and don't make a sound!

                                     BOB
                         Dr. M.! Everybody's looking for you.

               Marvin brandishes the back pack.

                                     MARVIN
                         I said shut up!

                                     BOB
                         Okay. You're the doc.

               EXT. THE MARVIN HOUSE, SAME

               Marvin, carrying the back pack, leads Bob outside. Bob looks 
               relaxed.

                                     BOB
                         Where we going hiking?

                                     MARVIN
                         Into the woods.

                                     BOB
                         Is this is a new form of therapy?

                                     MARVIN
                         Yeah, Bob, it's death therapy. It's 
                         a guaranteed cure.

                                     BOB
                         Death therapy. I like it.

               Marvin leads Bob into the woods beside the cottage.

               EXT. THE WOODS NEAR THE HOUSE, SAME

               Bob sits on a stump. Marvin puts the back pack on Bob's 
               shoulders then starts tying his hands behind him. Bob sits 
               passively, letting him.

                                     BOB
                         This is pretty imaginative, Dr. M. 
                         Will this be in your new book?

                                     MARVIN
                         If it is, I'll dedicate it to you, 
                         how's that?

                                     BOB
                         Great. Ow. That hurts. Ow.

               Marvin keeps tying Bob's hands.

                                     BOB
                         What is this now, pain therapy?

                                     MARVIN
                         Exactly. Now yell and scream and 
                         suffer!

                                     BOB
                         Ow! Ahh! Ow! That really hurts.

               Marvin sets the timer then walks away.

                                     MARVIN
                         Say hello to Freud for me.

               Marvin walks out of the woods.

                                     BOB
                         Dr. M, this hurts!

                                     MARVIN (O.S.)
                         Love hurts.

               INT. THE MARVIN HOUSE LIVING ROOM, SAME

               Marvin enters, looking happy. He goes to the stereo, puts on 
               Neil Diamond's "Penny Arcade" and cranks it up loud, then 
               goes to the window and opens it.

                                     MARVIN
                              (yelling to the woods)
                         Music to die by, Bob!

               Marvin does a little dance and talks to himself.

                                     MARVIN
                         I guess it was suicide, Fay. He tried 
                         it once, remember. Just goes to show, 
                         you never can tell.

               EXT. THE WOODS, SAME

               Bob sits trying to get comfortable.

                                     BOB
                         I'm worried about getting gangrene, 
                         Dr. M! I think I get the point!

               He struggles some more.

                                     BOB
                              (to himself)
                         At least I think I get the point.
                              (pause)
                         Maybe I'm not supposed to sit here.
                              (pause)
                         Maybe I'm supposed to undo these 
                         outer knots...

               He begins struggling to untie himself.

                                     BOB
                         So that my inner knots..., these 
                         strong..., restricting..., inner 
                         knots...

               He gets a hand free.

                                     BOB
                         Will come undone too.

               Both hands free, Bob stands.

                                     BOB
                         Yes!

               INT. THE MARVIN HOUSE LIVING ROOM, SAME

               Marvin is still dancing around, looking at his watch. He 
               holds up five, four, three, two, one fingers then prepares 
               for an explosion. Instead Bob opens the door.

                                     MARVIN
                         Ahh!

               Still wearing the back pack, Bob walks into the room.

                                     BOB
                         Death therapy cured me!

               Marvin runs across the room away from Bob.

                                     MARVIN
                         No!

                                     BOB
                         Yes! I used to be so afraid of 
                         everything, it was like dying a 
                         thousand deaths a day. Now, that you 
                         showed me I have only one death to 
                         be afraid of, I'm not afraid of 
                         anything anymore!

                                     MARVIN
                         NOOOO!

               Marvin runs out the back door of the house. Bob stands there 
               watching him.

                                     BOB
                         Don't be so modest!

               EXT. THE MARVIN DOCK, DAY

               Marvin runs out to the dock and tries to start the little 
               motor boat that sits there. Bob stops at the back door of 
               the house, casually tosses the back pack onto a chair, then 
               follows Marvin.

                                     BOB
                         Dr. M.?

               Bob walks out onto the dock. Marvin is working frantically 
               to start the motorboat.

                                     BOB
                         Dr. M., I'm really cured!

               The house explodes. Debris rains down on Bob and Marvin. 
               After it settles, the bust of Freud lands on the dock in 
               front of them.

                                     BOB
                         Did somebody leave the gas on?

                                     MARVIN
                         Why won't you go away! I disgraced 
                         myself on national television! No 
                         one will buy my book! My family's 
                         going to hate me!

                                     BOB
                         Dr. M., your family loves you.

                                     MARVIN
                         I'M FINISHED!

               Marvin is about to attack Bob then stands limp, a beaten 
               man. What's left of the house is now burning. The Guttmans 
               have run out of their trailer.

                                     THE GUTTMANS
                         Burn. Burn! Burn!!

               In the distance, SIRENS APPROACH.

                                     BOB
                         Dr. M. you have the crown jewels of 
                         England all around you. You have a 
                         wife with a generous heart. You have 
                         great kids and an incredible sister.

                                     MARVIN
                         Stay away from my sister!

                                     BOB
                         Dr. M, you have a fam!

               Marvin stares at Bob then takes a small can of gas from the 
               old motorboat and pours gas on himself. The SIRENS get closer.

                                     BOB
                         You know, I'm beginning to think 
                         you're an ingrate.

                                     MARVIN
                         What?!

                                     BOB
                         People are miserable all over the 
                         world and you're killing yourself? 
                         You should be ashamed.

                                     MARVIN
                         Don't talk that way to me!

                                     BOB
                         Maybe I was wrong about you.

                                     MARVIN
                         Do you hear me?!

                                     BOB
                         Maybe you're not so good after all.

               Marvin leaps on Bob.

                                     MARVIN
                         I'll kill you!

               Marvin attacks Bob on the dock. Fire trucks arrive. Fay and 
               the family drive up too. As a couple of FIREMEN and the family 
               rush to separate Marvin and Bob...

                                                          LONG DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. DOCTORS' HOUSE BOAT, SUNSET

               The doctors and their wives sit around Phil, stunned. Off 
               their bow is the slab that was once the Marvin house.

                                     PHIL
                         And they took him away.

                                     DOCTOR 1
                         My god, it was insanity. Bob drove 
                         Marvin to complete insanity!

                                     WIFE
                         What happened?

                                     PHIL
                         Leo was taken to the Tomsky Institute 
                         for a few days for observation. He 
                         lost his medical license, of course. 
                         A doctor can't try to kill one of 
                         his patients and expect to get away 
                         with it.

                                     WIFE
                         Well thank god for that.
                              (the other doctors 
                              stare daggers at her)
                         I mean..., you know... I mean...
                              (pause)
                         Then what happened?

                                     PHIL
                         Leo was returned to his family.

               EXT. THE TOMSKY CONVALESCENT HOME, DAY

               Leo stands, small suitcase in hand, looking sad and fragile. 
               Fay, Anna, Siggy, Lily and Bob get out of the station wagon 
               and look at him. No one says a word, then Bob goes up and 
               puts his arms around Leo. Leo stands motionless, shell 
               shocked.

                                     PHIL (O.S.)
                         Bob and the family rented a lakeside 
                         cottage where they could help Leo 
                         recuperate.

               EXT. THE LAWN OF A LAKESIDE COTTAGE, DAY

               Gil's bowl sits on a lawn table. In addition to Gil, the 
               bowl now contains several baby guppies. Marvin lies on a 
               deck chair, covered with a blanket, staring into nowhere. 
               Bob is next to him, talking on a cordless phone.

                                     BOB
                              (into phone)
                         I understand. Sure.

               He hangs up and puts the phone down.

                                     BOB
                              (to Leo)
                         Tough business.

               Bob makes some notes in his organizer then gets up. He grabs 
               hold of both of Leo's shoulders.

                                     BOB
                              (reassuringly)
                         I'm going over here. I'll be right 
                         over here.

               Leo doesn't look at him. A zombie would seem more alive. Bob 
               goes and joins the volleyball game.

                                     BOB (O.S.)
                         Okay, I'm with Siggy.

               Marvin sits staring into nowhere. The phone rings. Again.

                                     MARVIN
                              (almost inaudible)
                         Phone.

               The volleyball game continues.

                                     MARVIN
                              (a touch louder)
                         Phone.

               After another ring, he reaches for it.

                                     MARVIN
                              (INTO PHONE)
                              (listlessly affectless)
                         Hello.

                                     VOICE ON PHONE
                         May I speak to Bob, please?

                                     MARVIN
                              (still staring into 
                              nowhere)
                         Bob's... unavailable right now. Can... 
                         I take a message?

                                     VOICE ON PHONE
                         I'm Mr. Jameson with the Tucson school 
                         district. Bob contacted us about 
                         buying some toothbrushes but we're 
                         going to have to cancel the order.

                                     MARVIN
                              (writing)
                         Tucson canceling order... Any message 
                         why?

                                     JAMESON
                              (on phone)
                         It's not a priority right now.

                                     MARVIN
                              (writing)
                         Not priority... right now.
                              (pause)
                         Why?

                                     JAMESON
                              (ON PHONE)
                         Well... money's tight and...

                                     MARVIN
                         Sure.
                              (pause)
                         Though, you know there is another 
                         way to look at it.

                                     JAMESON
                              (ON PHONE)
                         What's that?

                                     MARVIN
                         Well... if you gave a new toothbrush 
                         and taught dental hygiene to every 
                         student at your school... In the 
                         long run you'd save them thousands 
                         of dollars. I mean look at the cost 
                         of dental bills. I bet I could have 
                         put my kids through college with 
                         what I've spent on fillings.

                                     JAMESON
                         That's an interesting point.

                                     MARVIN
                         It is, isn't it?
                              (pause)
                         Maybe you should try the toothbrushes. 
                         You might do a lot for education by 
                         saving teeth.

                                     JAMESON
                         Huh. I never thought of that.
                              (pause)
                         I tell you what. Tell Bob we'll take 
                         the order and see how it goes.

                                     MARVIN
                         Great.

               Marvin hangs up the phone. He affectless expression suddenly 
               turns to one full of thought.

                                     MARVIN
                         Fay.

               Marvin sits up, gaining energy, even enthusiasm.

                                     MARVIN
                         Fay!

               The Marvin family hurries over.

                                     PHIL (V.O.)
                         Leo Marvin now makes toothbrushes.

               Bob puts his arm around Leo as he gestures and talks more 
               and more animatedly to his delighted family.

                                     PHIL (V.O.)
                         The irony, of course, is that Bob 
                         brought the family closer than they'd 
                         ever been before. Harvey Green saw 
                         Leo last month and said he never 
                         looked happier.

               EXT. THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE BOAT

               The doctors are stunned.

                                     FEINBERG
                         My god. The poor bastard.

                                     ANOTHER DOCTOR
                         And you thought you had nightmares.

                                     FEINBERG
                         Unbelievable...

                                     WIFE
                         What happened to Bob?

               The others jump in: "Yeah, what about Bob? What about Bob? 
               What about Bob?"

                                     PHIL
                         Bob married Lily and had triplets. 
                         He went back to school, got a degree 
                         in marriage-family-counseling, and 
                         now has a big practice on Park and 
                         75th.

               INT. BOB WILEY'S MANHATTAN OFFICE, DAY

               Bob sits in the shrink's chair. Sitting in three chairs in 
               front of him are a FATHER, MOTHER, and SON.

                                     SON
                         Douche bag.

                                     MOTHER
                         Bastard head!

                                     FATHER
                         Son of a bitch!

                                     BOB
                              (gently to the father)
                         Try ass wipe of the universe.

                                     FATHER
                         Ass wipe of the universe!

               The family look at each other. Tears well. They hug.

                                     BOB
                         Excellent.

               EXT. THE DOCTORS ON THE BOAT

               The doctors look at each other in astonishment.

                                     DOCTOR 2 (V.O.)
                         Wait a minute. You're not telling me 
                         that Bob Wiley is Dr. Robert S. Wiley, 
                         the psychologist?!

                                     PHIL
                         That's exactly what I'm telling you.

               A BIG HOUSE BOAT goes by. Phil yells to it.

                                     PHIL
                         Hey Bob! Hello, BOB!!

               ANGLE ON THE BIG HOUSEBOAT

               Bob is surrounded by Lily Marvin, three toddlers and lots of 
               friends. Smiling, Bob waves at the doctors.

                                     FEINBERG (V.O.)
                         Wrote that huge best seller? What's 
                         it called?

               Bob's boat turns. On it's stern, in huge letters is it's 
               name: "Vacation Therapy".

                                     FEINBERG (V.O.)
                         Vacation Therapy!

                                     PHIL (V.O.)
                         Exactly. Sold 2 million copies.

               ANGLE ON THE DOCTORS BOAT

               who are dark green with envy.

                                     DOCTOR 2
                         I don't believe it!

                                     DOCTOR 1
                         Pinch me!

                                     FEINBERG
                         I'll never take another vacation as 
                         long as I live!

               ANGLE ON BOB'S HOUSEBOAT

               As the other doctors second in agreement, WE SEE Bob's hugely 
               happy houseboat motors off. We see Bob's big smile as he 
               passes out Kleenex to his family then waves good-bye to the 
               doctors.

               ROLL END CREDITS.

                                                THIRD DRAFT

                                                September 2, 1986









                        WHO SHOT ROGER RABBIT?

     This movie starts the way all movies should... with a
     cartoon.  It's not a Disney or a Warner's.  It's not a
     Fleischer, an MGM, or a Lanz.  This is a lesser known
     studio.


     FADE IN:

     ON A "MAROON CARTOON"

     Accompanied by zany CARTOON MUSIC, the TITLE CARD reads:

                   MAROON CARTOONS PRESENT
                BABY HERMAN AND ROGER RABBIT
                           IN
                      "THE BUNNYSITTER"

     Below are two cameos of the cartoon's stars.  One picture is
     of a cherubic baby in a bonnet innocently posed with his
     thumb in his mouth.  The other is of a paunchy rabbit with a
     gap between his front teeth.  He has a loveable, if slightly
     shell-shocked look.  The cartoon begins...


     BABY HERMAN AND ROGER RABBIT

     are in a playpen when TWO FEMALE LEGS in high heels walk INTO
     FRAME.  The VOICE belonging to the legs talks down to Baby
     Herman in a maternal coo.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
               Mommy's going to the beauty parlor,
               darling.  But I'm leaving you with your
               favorite friend, Roger.  He's going to
               take very, very good care of you...
                      (voice turns
                       ominous)
               ... cause if he doesn't, he's going
               back to the science lab!

     Roger gulps as he watches the legs disappear.  We HEAR
     FOOTSTEPS recede and a DOOR SLAM.  Roger turns confidently
     back to his charge.  But the little tyke is already squeezing
     through the playpen bars.

                               BABY HERMAN
               Baby bye-bye...

     Roger makes a dive for him, misses, and gets his head stuck
     between the bars.  He pleads with the Baby in a voice that
     resonates of Huntz Hall in "The Bowery Boys".

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hey, come back!  You heard what your
               mother said!


     BABY HERMAN

     ignores Roger.  We FOLLOW HIM as he crawls into the kitchen.
     He stops to regard something that has caught his attention...
     a cookie jar.  It's sitting on top of the refrigerator.

                               BABY HERMAN
               Coo-kie.


     ROGER

     wearing the playpen like a pillory, comes running toward the
     kitchen.  But the playpen is too wide to clear the door.  The
     impact SHATTERING the playpen and sends Roger sprawling
     across the kitchen floor.  When he looks up...


     BABY HERMAN

     is swinging precariously on the door of the freeer.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hang on, Baby.  I'll save you!

     Roger makes a desperate leap across the kitchen for the kid.
     But Baby Herman swings the door to the freezer open and Roger
     disappears inside.  Baby Herman grabs a cookie and swings
     back, shutting the door.  He climbs down and crawls out of
     the kitchen.  After a beat, the freezer door opens.


     ROGER

     now shaped like a block of ice, falls out and hits the floor.
     The block SHATTERS into ice cubes.  Roger looks around,
     dazed.


     BABY HERMAN

     has taken this opportunity to crawl out the window.  Roger
     races to the window.  His eyes pop out of his head at what he
     sees.


     ROGER'S POV

     Baby Herman is crawling along the sidewalk under the shadow
     of a safe being hoisted into a second floor window by the
     Acme Safe Moving Company.  The rope holding the safe is
     fraying down to a slender thread.


     ROGER

     gasps and rockets out the window toward Baby Herman.  The
     rope snaps.  The safe falls.  Roger arrives just in time to
     pluck the Baby out of harm's way.  But not in time to save
     himself.  The safe CRUNCHES down on his head, burying Roger
     into the sidewalk.  After a beat, Roger's hand appears and
     spins the tumbler.  The safe door opens.  Inside, we see the
     dazed rabbit with little TWEETING BIRDS circling his head.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
               Cut, cut, cut!

     The cartoon action stops abruptly, but the goofy CARTOON
     MUSIC PLAYS ON.  We begin a slow PULL BACK TO REVEAL that
     this cartoon is being filmed LIVE ON A SOUND STAGE.  The
     title card sits on an easle.  The female legs are paper
     mache' props manipulated by two HUMAN CREW MEMBERS.  Wearily,
     they lean the legs up against the stage wall.  A human
     DIRECTOR, wearing a tweed jacket and baggy pleated pants,
     steps onto the set.  From the equipment and the dress of the
     crew, we can tell it's the 1940's.  Baby Herman throws his
     cookie down in disgust.  He talks in a gravelly voice an
     octave lower than Wallace Beery's.

                               BABY HERMAN
               What the hell was wrong with that
               take??

                               DIRECTOR
               Nothin' with you, Baby Herman.  It's on
               Roger... again!
                      (over shoulder)
               Hey!  Could we lose the playback?

     The MUSIC suddenly STOPS as, off to the side, the SOUNDMAN
     lifts the needle off a phonograph record.  The Director leans
     over Roger and angrily plucks one of the birds circling his
     head.

                               DIRECTOR
                      (continuing)
               What's this, Roger?

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (sheepish)
               A tweeting bird?

                               DIRECTOR
               That's right, a tweeting bird.  But
               what does the script say?  'Rabbit gets
               conked.  Rabbit sees stars!'  Not
               birds, stars!

                               BABY HERMAN
               Aw, for cryin' out loud, Roger!  I'll
               be in my trailer... takin' a nap!

     Baby Herman pulls himself up to his full height of two feet
     and walks off the set.  He chooses a route that takes him
     under the dress of the SCRIPT GIRL.  She jumps as if goosed.
     Now two CREW MEMBERS lift the safe off Roger.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars,
               I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my
               head one more time.

                               DIRECTOR
               I've already dropped it on you
               twenty-three times.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Don't worry about me.  I can take it.

                               DIRECTOR
               I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried
               about the safe.

     CONTINUED PULLBACK.

     What we've been seeing has been from the POV of a MAN in a
     shiny brown suit standing unobtrusively at the back of the
     sound stage.  Under a beat-up fedora is a craggy face that's
     seen a lot in its life... but apparently didn't think much of
     it was funny.  EDDIE VALIANT takes a jolt from a pint of
     whiskey, evidently in reaction to what he's seen.  He opens
     his coat and returns the pint bottle to a shoulder holster
     which had formerly held a .38.  Nerves steadied, he walks out
     the stage door.


     EXT. MAROON STUDIO - DAY

     Valiant emerges from the stage onto a bustling Hollywood
     studio lot where CARTOON CHARACTERS (TOONS) and humans are
     comingling as if it were the most natural thing in the world.
     Valiant stops by an Acme Novelty truck which is unloading
     Toon props.  There are bombs, rockets, flattened pocket
     watches, anvils, giant slingshots, etcetera.  The license
     plate is California 1946.  He fishes out a pack of
     Chesterfields and taps out a half a butt that had been
     stubbed out.  As he lights it, Valiant regards a chubby,
     balding man wearing a three-piece suit and a worried
     expression coming towards him.  He is R.K. MAROON, studio
     boss.  Maroon is leading an entourage of ASSISTANTS trying to
     keep up.

                               MAROON
               Starting tomorrow there'll be no more
               roast beef lunches.  What happened to
               cheese sandwiches?  I was raised on
               cheese sandwiches.

     As the Assistants dutifully record his thoughts, Maroon sees
     a GUY taking a nap in the shade of a palm tree.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               And tell that guy sleepin' over there
               he's fired!
 
                               ASSISTANT
               It's your wife's brother, R.K.

                               MAROON
                      (reconsiders)
               Oh... tell him he's promoted.  But get
               him out of my sight.

     As the Assistants disperse, Maroon approaches Valiant.

                               MAROON
               Valiant, did you see the rabbit?

                               VALIANT
               He was blowin' his lines, all right.
               So what?

                               MAROON
               So what?  He's already put me three
               weeks behind on the shooting schedule!

     Now an EDITH HEAD-TYPE hustles up to show Maroon several
     costume designs.

                               COSTUMER
               Your reaction, R.K.?

     Maroon quickly checks out the drawing.

                               MAROON
               No!  That's not funny.
 
     She flips another drawing.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               That's funny.  Put a homburg on him
               it'll even be funnier.  Huh, Valiant?

     He grabs the pad and shows Valiant.  The rendering is of a
     hippo in a pink polka-dot tu-tu.

                               VALIANT
                      (deadpan)
               Yeah, that'd be a riot.

     Maroon responds to Valiant's sarcasm with raised eyebrows.

                               MAROON
               Boy, I hope what you have ain't
               contagious or I'll be out of business.

     He hands the pad back to the designer, who departs.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               How much do you know about show
               business, Valiant?

                               VALIANT
               Only there's no business like it, no
               business I know.

     Valiant watches an ALLIGATOR in a rebel uniform dragging a
     brace of cannons and several TOADSTOOLS parade by.

                               MAROON
               Yeah, and there's no business as
               expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over
               budget on the latest Bunnysitter
               cartoon and it's all because that
               rabbit can't keep his mind on his work.
               And you know why?

                               VALIANT
               One too many safes dropped on his head?

                               MAROON
               Nah, that goes with the territory.
               He's a stunt bunny.

     Maroon takes a copy of the "Hollywood Tattler" out of his
     pocket.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               Here's the problem...
                      (reads)
               "Seen cooing over calamari with
               notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica
               Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".
                      (looks up)
               His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's
               Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him
               up.

                               VALIANT
               So what do you want me to do?

                               MAROON
               Get me a couple juicy pictures.
               Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up
               with.

                               VALIANT
               I don't work in Toontown.

                               MAROON
               You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife
               sings at an underground Toon revue
               joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You
               can catch her in action there.

                               VALIANT
               The job's gonna cost you a hundred
               bucks.

                               MAROON
               A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.

                               VALIANT
               So's the job.

     Valiant starts to walk away.

                               MAROON
               All right, all right... You got your
               hundred bucks.

     Maroon turns, snaps his fingers.  His Assistant appears out
     of nowhere with Maroon's checkbook and a pen.  The Assistant
     turns and stoops so that Maroon can write the check on his
     back.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               Fifty now, fifty when you deliver the
               pictures.

     Maroon tears the check off and hands it to Valiant.  Suddenly
     Valiant ducks in reflex to a large shadow that passes
     overhead.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing;
                       chuckles)
               Kinda jumpy aren't you, Valiant?  It's
               just Dumbo.


     ABOVE THEIR HEADS - DUMBO

     swoops back and forth, then hovers, ears flapping like a
     hummingbird.

                               MAROON
               I got him on loan from Disney.

                               VALIANT
               Aren't you the lucky one...

     Valiant grabs the check from Maroon and starts for the gate.

                               MAROON
               When will I hear from you?

                               VALIANT
               As soon as is humanly possible.

     We FOLLOW Valiant out the gate under a wrought iron sign that
     reads "Maroon Cartoon Studios".  As he starts across the road
     he's almost run over by a Toon roadster that ROARS out of the
     gates.  When it BLASTS ITS HORN, it's the FIRST FIVE NOTES
     from the WOODY WOODPECKER SONG:  "HA-HA-HA-HA-HA".  Valiant
     jumps back as the roadster passes.  WOODY THE WOODPECKER'S
     behind the wheel with a self-important smile on his face.
     Valiant angrily waves the cloud of Toon dust away.

                               VALIANT
                      (coughs)
               Damn Toons.


     ACROSS THE STREET - A TROLLEY CAR

     is slowing to a stop in front of the studio.  It's a Pacific
     and Electric "Red Car", part of a vast system of electric
     trollies that once criss-crossed the L.A. Basin.  Valiant
     steps onto the "Red Car".  He reaches into his pocket to give
     the CONDUCTOR his nickel fare.  But he comes up with a
     handful of lint.  He holds out the check.

                               CONDUCTOR
               What do I look like, a bank?

     The Conductor jerks his thumb toward the door.  Valiant
     suffers the public humiliation,of having to step down past
     the rest of the boarding passengers.  He walks around to the
     back of the Red Car where a gang of TEN-YEAR-OLDS are
     loitering.  When the BELL SOUNDS and the Red Car starts to
     pull away, the Kids make a dash for a place on the cow
     catcher.  Valiant joins them.  We HOLD as the Red Car moves
     away and the street urchins regard their older partner in
     crime with curiosity.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:


     A BILLBOARD SIGN

     It reads:  "L.A.'s Pacific and Electric Red Car -- America's
     Finest Public Transportation System".  PAN DOWN to see that
     the sign is on the roof of the trolley terminal.  Red Cars
     are going in and out of the shed.  MOVE IN on one car
     approaching the terminal from down the street.  As it passes
     by...


     VALIANT

     hops off his freeloader's seat on the back,

                               KID
               So long, mister.

     Valiant waves laconically.

                               VALIANT
               Thanks for the cigarettes.

     We FOLLOW Valiant as he crosses the street to a seedy
     bungalow.  A note is push-pinned to the door.


     CLOSE - NOTE

     It says:  "Tomorrow's Friday... Well?  Dolores".


     VALIANT

     takes the note and walks back across the street toward the
     terminal.  He climbs up a flight of stairs, heading for a bar
     on the mezzanine.  The bar sports a red neon sign that used
     to blink, "The Terminal Station Bar".  But now it just says,
     "Terminal".


     INT. TERMINAL BAR - DAY

     The place must have been pretty swanky at the turn of the
     century when it was built in the first burst of enthusiasm
     over the new public transportation system.  It's in the motif
     of a trolley car.  There's a large map on the wail above the
     bar showing all the different lines.  Behind the bar is
     DOLORES.  If you scraped off all the makeup, you'd find an
     attractive woman in her late thirties.  She ministers to a
     rag-tag assortment of Hollywood low-lifes -- who are truly at
     the end of the line.


     VALIANT

     enters this den, lets his eyes adjust for a moment, then
     bellies up to the bar.  He finds a spot between a ONE-ARMED
     BLACK SOLDIER and a MIDGET stretched out on the bar passed
     out.  Now a TROLLEY RUMBLES underneath them.  The bar starts
     to shake like an earthquake, the lights flicker.  All the
     drinkers, observing a time honored ritual, lift their glasses
     simultaneously to avoid spilling any drops.  Even the Midget
     lifts his head until the trolley has passed.  Valiant reaches
     over the bar and blind-grabs a bottle of rye he obviously
     knows is there.  He pours himself a shot.

                               VALIANT
               Hey, fellas, what's the good word?

                               SOLDIER
               Lost my job.

     An ARTHRITIC COWBOY pipes up.

                               COWBOY
               Mule died.

     A DEAF-MUTE scribbles a note on a pad hanging around his
     neck.  He hands the note to Valiant.  It says "My girl dumped
     me".  Valiant pats him on the back, consoling.

                               VALIANT
               Well, you know what they say about
               dames, Augie...

     Then Valiant mouths the rest of it for Augie's benefit only.
     Augie reads his lips, then starts to roar silently, slapping
     his thigh.  Now Dolores makes her way down the bar.  She
     grabs the Midget by the suspenders and slides him out of the
     way.

                               DOLORES
               So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie?
               Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a
               dame who took a hundred bucks out of
               the till so your landlord would't
               throw you out of your dump.  And it was
               a dame who trusted you for the money
               when no one else in town would.  And
               it's a dame who's tired of waitin' for
               you to straighten yourself out and get
               a job!

                               VALIANT
               Would this be the same dame who's going
               to feel awfully foolish when she finds
               out I've got her money.

     Valiant slides the check across the bar.  Dolores studies it.
     She calms down a little.

                               DOLORES
               This is fifty bucks.  I need
               seventy-five before they check the
               books tomorrow.

                               VALIANT
               You'll have it in the morning.  Now be
               a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to
               put in my pocket.

                               DOLORES
               Is this paper even good?

                               VALIANT
               Check the scrawl.

                               DOLORES
                      (reads)
               R.K. Maroon.

     Now ANGELO, a Neanderthal sitting a few stools down, is
     tapping the shell of a hardboiled egg.

                               ANGELO
               Maroon?  Valiant, don't tell me you're
               workin' for a Toon?  Who's your client?
               Chilly Willy or Screwy Squirrel?

     Angelo chuckles at his own joke and goes to eat his egg.
     Suddenly Valiant darkens.  He grabs Angelo by the shirt and
     pulls him up to his face.

                               VALIANT
               Get this straight, greaseball.  I'm not
               workin' for a Toon!  I'd never work for
               a Toon!  Got that?

     Valiant jams the whole egg into Angelo's mouth, turns and
     storms out the door.  Angelo sputters and spits out the egg.

                               ANGELO
               What's his problem?

                               DOLORES
               Toon killed his brother.


     EXT. INK & PAINT CLUB - NIGHT

     Valiant knocks on the door of, a non-descript building in a
     run-down factory area.  A speakeasy style peephole slides
     open REVEALING the face of a TOON GORILLA.  Valiant offers
     the password.

                               VALIANT
               Walt sent me.

     The peephole slides closed and after a beat the door swings
     open.


     INT. CLUB

     The Gorilla, dressed in a tux, gives Valiant the once over.
     Valiant resents the assessment.

                               VALIANT
               Like your monkey suit.

                               GORILLA
               Wise ass...

     We FOLLOW Valiant down the hall toward the main room.  We can
     HEAR LAUGHTER and ZANY MUSIC from within.


     INT. MAIN ROOM

     When Valiant steps through the doorway, we see the place is
     no dive.  It's a white tablecloth nightclub on a par with the
     El Morroco or the Garden of Allah.  Behind the bar A
     CATERPILLAR BARTENDER is using his many arms to shake and
     pour several drinks at once.  Meanwhile a dozen PENGUIN
     WAITERS are gliding back and forth along the tables serving
     drinks to the well-heeled crowd.


     ON STAGE

     DONALD DUCK and DAFFY DUCK are seated opposite each other at
     matching grand pianos.  What begins as a decorous Duck duet
     on a Tchaikovsky piece (complete with knuckle-cracking,
     seat-spinning preparations) quickly accelerates to a loony
     game of one-upsmanship between these two irascible Ducks.
     There is keyboard stomping, lid-banging, piano wire plucking
     zaniness.


     THE AUDIENCE

     is HOWLING.  People are wiping the tears from their eyes
     they're laughing so hard.  All except...


     VALIANT

     He lights a cigarette impassively, not humored by the Toon
     hijinx.  He spots an empty table off to the side and makes
     his way towards it.  A SILLY GEEZER in a loud suit is at the
     next table.  The Geezer nods to him soberly as Valiant pulls
     Out the chair and sits down.  A LOUD FLATULENCE SOUND erupts
     from under Valiant.  The Geezer slaps his thigh with the
     hilarity of it all.

                               GEEZER
               Will you listen to that?  It's a pip!
               I'm thinking of callin' it a Whoopee
               Cushion.

     Valiant reaches under himself and comes up holding a deflated
     rubber bladder.  The Geezer retrieves it from him.

                               GEEZER
                       (continuing)
                No hard feelings, I hope.  Put 'er
                there...

     The Geezer grabs Valiant's hand before he can say no.  We
     HEAR A BUZZ.  Valiant retracts his hand as if shocked.  The
     Geezer howls with laughter and turns his palm to Eddie.

                               GEEZER
                      (continuing)
               Hand buzzer... real gasser.

     Valiant rolls his eyes and grabs a Penguin as it glides by.

                               VALIANT
               Scotch.

                               PENGUIN
               There's a two drink minimum.

                               VALIANT
               Just as long as there's no maximum.

                               GEEZER
               Waiter, I'll sign my check now.

     The Penguin puts a bill down on the Geezer's table and zips
     off.  The Geezer takes a fountain pen out of his jacket and
     writes on the bill.  But there doesn't seem to be any ink
     coming out.  He shakes and shakes the pen to get it flowing.
     It flows all right.  Ink splatters all over Valiant's shirt
     and pants.  Valiant looks down at the stain, doing a slow
     burn.  The Geezer starts laughing.  Valiant jumps up and
     grabs him by the lapels.

                               VALIANT
               That's it for you, pops!

                               GEEZER
                      (freaked)
               Calm down, son.  Look, the ink is gone.

     Valiant looks down at his shirt.  The stain is gone.

                               GEEZER
                      (continuing)
               See?  It disappears.

                               VALIANT
               Well, why don't you make like the ink?

     Valiant drops him into his chair and returns to his seat.
     The Penguin glides up with his drinks.  Valiant swallows the
     first one with one quick jerk of the head.


     ON STAGE

     Donald and Daffy's PIANO COMPETITION has reached a CRESCENDO
     of mayhem.  They've got the axes out, and in time with the
     MUSIC they reduce their pianos to matchsticks.  At the
     completion of the piece, they step to the front of the stage
     and with great decorum, arms around each other, they take
     their bows.  The curtain comes down to GREAT APPLAUSE.  We
     HEAR SFX of CRASHING AND BASHING backstage.  Now from behind
     Valiant, we HEAR a familiar high-pitched VOICE.

                               CIGARETTE GIRL
               Cigars... cigarettes... Eddie?

     Valiant turns to see BETTY BOOP standing with a box of
     tobacco wares strapped around her neck.  In contrast to all
     the other Toons, Betty's in black and white.

                               BETTY BOOP
                      (continuing)
               Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We
               miss you in Toontown.

                               VALIANT
               Wish I could say the same.  What're you
               doin' here, Betty?

                               BETTY BOOP
               Work's been slow for me since the
               cartoons went to color.  But I still
               got it, Eddie...
                      (sings)
               'Boop boop be-doop'.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, you still got it, Betty.
                      (indicates
                       Geezer)
               Who's Mr. Jocularity?

                               BETTY BOOP
                      (leans in)
               That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.

                               VALIANT
               Shoulda guessed.

                               BETTY BOOP
               He comes here every night to see
               Jessica Rabbit.

                               VALIANT
               Big on the musical comedy, huh?

                               BETTY BOOP
               Sounds like you ve never seen her,
               Eddie.

     Now the lights dim and Betty moves on.


     ON STAGE

     the dour DROOPY walks out with the spotlight following him.
     He's the evening's emcee.

                               DROOPY
                      (deadpan)
               Hello, everybody.  I hope you're all
               having as much fun as I am.  I have a
               small announcement to make.  Jessica
               Rabbit will not be able to sing
               tonight.

     There's a ROAR OF DISAPPROVAL from the men in the crowd.
     They shower him with debris.

                               DROOPY
                      (continuing;
                       deadpan)
               I was merely jesting.  Without further
               ado... here's woman times two,
               Toontown's own chanteuse par
               excellance... Jessica Rabbit!

     There is excited APPLAUSE as the lights dim. A TOON COMBO
     made up of CROWS in shades STRIKES UP the intro to the smokey
     song, "Why Don't You Do Right".  A spotlight hits the
     curtain. Now a curvaceous leg pokes out, teasingly.  The
     crowd goes wild as the rest of the body belonging to the leg
     emerges.  JESSICA RABBIT is a generously endowed red-headed
     bombshell.  She's a humanoid Toon... in her case, more
     beautiful than human.  Her figure is testimony to what a guy
     can do with a pencil and a fertile imagination,


     REACTION - VALIANT

     This is not quite the bunny he expected Roger to be married
     to.  His jaw drops.  And his reaction is mirrored all around
     the room.  The men are panting so hard you couldn't keep a
     match lit.


     CLOSEUP - JESSICA

     as she steps to the mike.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (sings)
               'You had plenty of money back
                  in '22
               You let other woman make a fool
                  of you
               Why don't you do right.
               Like some other men do...
               Get out of here and
               Get me the money too...'

     Jessica takes the mike and comes off the stage.  Slinkily.
     she wanders among the tables, teasing the men as she goes.

     Now there's a HOWL from behind Valiant.  A Tex Avery type
     TOON WOLF, who came masquerading as a human, couldn't help
     but show his true colors at the sight of Jessica.  He HOWLS
     as if it were a full moon.  His tongue rolls out of his head
     and piles up on the floor like so much clothesline.  His
     eyeballs telescope out of his head.  And finally, the Wolf
     levitates and snaps rigid like an open jacknife.  As the Wolf
     makes a rush for the stage, the Gorilla Bouncer grabs him by
     the suspenders.  The Wolf, legs spinning madly, practically
     knocks Valiant's table over as he grabs at Jessica.  But the
     Wolf has come to the end of his suspenders.  He snaps back
     toward the Gorilla who is holding an anvil in front of the
     suspenders.  CLANG!  The Wolf hits the anvil and slides to
     the floor.  The Gorilla calmly whisks him into a dustpan and
     carries him out.


     JESSICA

     like all good saloon singers, has continued her act
     undaunted.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (singing)
               'Why don't you do right.
               Like some other men do...'

     She sashays over to the Geezer's table.  Teasingly, she
     swirls the whisps of white hair onto his head into a Dairy
     Queen.  He giggles gleefully and makes a grab at Jessica.
     But she slips out of his grasp like mercury.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               'You ain't got no money
               Ain't got no use for you...'

     Now Jessica works her way over to Eddie.  She stops at his
     table and sings tauntingly.  Then with a flourish, she throws
     herself in his lap, and belts out the finale.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               'So get out of here...
               And get me the money toooo!'

     There is RAUCOUS APPLAUSE when she finishes.  Jessica looks
     deep into Eddie's eyes.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               Thanks for your lap.

     Before Eddie can reply, she jumps off, and slinks offstage,
     leaving Eddie a pile of human wreckage.  Valiant slugs the
     rest of his drink down to put out the fire in his libido.

     When the lights come up, Valiant looks over to where Acme is
     slicking down his eyebrows and patting his hair down.  He
     stands, picks up a bouquet of roses from the chair beside
     him, and as he passes Valiant's table, gives him a big wink.
     Valiant watches Acme disappear backstage.  He stands, drops
     a couple bucks on the table, and follows after him.


     BACKSTAGE

     Valiant steps past the curtain, keeping a discreet distance.
     He follows Marvin Acme down a corridor and around the corner.
     Acme stops and knocks on a dressing room door.  After a
     moment, it opens and Acme goes inside.  Valiant checks over
     his shoulder, but the backstage area is empty.  He eases over
     to the door and puts his eye to the keyhole.


     POV THROUGH KEYHOLE

     Jessica is seated at her dressing table.  Acme is on his
     knees next to her, kissing his way up her gloved hand, eyes
     closed in ecstasy.  Jessica takes her hand out of the glove
     and starts combing her hair, leaving Marvin kissing a
     suspended Toon glove.


     ANGLE ON VALIANT

     while he continues his peeping.  The Gorilla bouncer sneaks
     up behind him.

                               GORILLA
               Hey, whaddaya think you're doin',
               chump?

                               VALIANT
               Who're you callin' chump, chimp?

     The Gorilla smiles sadistically when he recognizes Valiant.

                               GORILLA
               Oh, it's da comedian...

     The Gorilla grabs Valiant by the belt and lifts him off the
     ground.  He opens the fire door and heaves Valiant out.


     EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

     Valiant comes flying out the door and CRASHES into a bunch of
     garbage cans in the alley.  The Gorilla stands in the doorvay
     regarding the dazed Valiant.

                               GORILLA
               And don't lemme catch your peepin' face
               around here again.  Got it?

                               VALIANT
               Ooga-booga.

     The Gorilla slams the door.  Valiant picks himself up out of
     the garbage.  He brushes himself off, then starts down the
     alley toward the rear of the building.  We FOLLOW him around
     the corner where he stops under Jessica's dressing room
     window.  He drags over a milk crate to stand on, takes a
     small camera out of his pocket and opens the bellows.  He
     stands on the crate and aims the camera through the corner of
     the window, as we HEAR the MUFFLED CONVERSATION from within.

                               ACME (O.S.)
               Are we going to play pattycake tonight?

                               JESSICA RABBIT (0.5.)
               Marvin, I have a headache...

                               ACME (O.S.)
                      (hurt)
               But you promised...

                               JESSICA RABBIT (O.S.)
               Oh, all right.  But this time take that
               hand buzzer off...

     Valiant's eyes widen in disgust.

                               VALIANT
               Jesus Christ...

     As he starts CLICKING pictures...

                                              CUT TO:


     EXT. MAROON STUDIO - LATE NIGHT

     There's one light on in the Administration building.


     INT. MAROON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     It's a large art deco office with walls covered with photos
     of Maroon and various celebrities, human and Toon.  R.K.
     Maroon is seated behind his desk.  Standing nearby is
     Valiant.  They are both regarding a hysterical Roger Rabbit,
     who's holding a set of 8 x lO glossies.  He's WAILING and
     CRYING, Toon tears flooding off him in a torrent.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Pattycake!  Pattycake!

                               VALIANT
               Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a
               good pair of shoes over it.

     ANGLE ON RUG

     Roger's tears have formed a puddle around the desk.  Valiant
     lifts a well-worn oxford and shakes the water off it.


     MAROON

     hands Roger his handkerchief.  Roger AAH-OO-GA'S his nose.

                               MAROON
               Take comfort, son, you're not the first
               man whose wife played pattycake on him.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I don't believe it.  I won't believe
               it.

                               MAROON
               The pictures don't lie.  Mr. Valiant
               here took them himself.

     Roger takes another look at the pictures.


     CLOSE - PHOTOS

     They're shots of Jessica Rabbit and Marvin Acme seated knee
     to knee, caught in the act of slapping palms... really
     playing pattycake.


     BACK TO SCENE

     Maroon gets up and crosses to a bar table set up by the
     window.  He pours a drink from a crystal decanter as Roger
     starts sobbing again.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               But Jessy... she's the light of my
               life, the apple of my eye, the cream in
               my coffee...

     Valiant eyes the booze longingly as he mutters to himself.

                               VALIANT
               Well, you better start thinkin' about
               drinkin' it black.

                               MAROON
               Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's
               been my friend and neighbor for thirty
               years.

     Maroon gestures out the window.  We see a blinking neon sign
     on the roof of the building across the street -- "Acme - If
     It's Acme - It's A Gasser!"

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               Who would have thought he was the Sugar
               Daddy?

     Maroon turns and carries the drink to Roger.  Meanwhile,
     Valiant sidles over to the bar to help himself.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               Well, the important thing now Roger, is
               to put all this behind you.
                      (hands him
                       drink)
               Drink this, son, you'll feel better.

     Roger takes the glass and shoots it down in one gulp.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               I know this all seems painful now, but
               you'll find someone new.  Won't he, Mr,
               Valiant?

     Eddie has just picked up the decanter to pour one for
     himself.

                               VALIANT
                      (over shoulder)
               Oh, yeah.  Good lookin' guy like him.
               Dames'll be breakin' his door down.


     CLOSE - ROGER

     The booze is taking its effect.  There's a RUMBLE like a
     volcano about to erupt.  Suddenly Roger's head turns into a
     Toon steam whistle SHRIEKING.  The HIGH PITCH causes glass
     objects in the room to SHATTER... including the crystal
     decanter that Valiant's holding in his hand.  It EXPLODES,
     soaking his suit with booze.  Valiant looks down at the
     damage, completely exasperated.

                               VALIANT
               Son-of-a-bitch...
                      (turns)
               Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now,
               so about the rest of my fee...

                               MAROON
               Sure, Valiant, sure...

     Maroon sits at the desk and writes a check.

                               MAROON
               Being experienced in these matrimonial
               matters, you have any advice for our
               friend here?

     Valiant crosses to the desk and takes the check.

                               VALIANT
               My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get
               yourself a quickie divorce.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Divorce?  Never!

     Suddenly Roger jumps onto Maroon's desk and grabs Valiant by
     the lapels.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Marriage is a two-way street and we're
               just experiencing a detour!  Jessica
               and I are going to get back together.
               We're going to be happy!   H-A-P-P-I!

     Roger zips off the desk and CRASHES out the window, leaving a
     rabbit outline in the glass... backlit by the blinking Acme
     sign.  Maroon and Valiant walk to the window and look out the
     rabbit-shaped hole in the window.

                               VALIANT
               At least he took it well.


     INT. VALIANT'S BUNGALOW - CLOSE - EMPTY BOOZE BOTTLE - EARLY
     MORNING

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL the bottle's on the floor next to the
     couch Valiant's passed out on.  He's still dressed in his
     clothes.  PAN the small studio apartment.  In the
     kitchen/alcove, Valiant has created a makeshift darkroom.  We
     see a curtain on a clothesline.  Various trays, and some
     pictures clipped up on clothespins.  The pictures depict
     Jessica Rabbit and Marvin Acme in various states of
     pattycake.  Now there is LOUD POUNDING on the door.  But it
     doesn't break through VaLiant's subconscious for several
     seconds.  Finally, he rouses, gets up and walks a crooked
     line to the door.  Valiant opens it and squints into the
     excruciating sunlight.  When his eyes focus, REVEAL a
     hang-dog POLICE DETECTIVE holding Eddie's morning paper.

                               VALIANT
               Lieutenant Santino... how ya doin'?

     Santino ignores the question and regards Valiant with a
     mixture of disgust and pity.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for
               a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.

                               VALIANT
               That's what you woke me up for?

     Santino flops open the morning paper.  Valiant's eyes narrow
     as he reads it.  The headline screams:  "TOON KILLS MAN!" And
     underneath:  "Marvin Acme Murdered at the Hands of Jealous
     Rabbit".  Santino throws the paper on the sofa.

                               LT. SANTINO
               You got trouble, Eddie.

     EXT. ACME FACTORY - DAY

     An L.A. police car turns into the yard of the Acme factory
     and pulls up in front of the old factory building.  There's
     all kinds of official activity in the yard... cop cars, a
     Coroner's truck, etcetera.

     Valiant and Santino get out of the police car.  Santino
     starts into the factory.  But he realizes Valiant's not
     following him.  He turns to see Valiant looking over the wall
     behind the factory, transfixed.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Now what?

                               VALIANT
               Just haven't been this close to
               Toontown for awhile.


     VALIANT'S POV

     The sky above the wall is a different color, a little bit
     more vibrant, a "Toon Blue", you might call it.


     SANTINO

     walks back and takes Valiant's arm.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Let's go, somebody wants to see you.

     Santino leads Valiant into the factory.


     INT. FACTORY - DAY

     It's a large warehouse filled with stacks of Toon gags,..
     boxes of dynamite, giant slingshots, boulders, everything
     you've ever seen in a Roadrunner cartoon.  Santino stops
     where a large black safe is imbedded at a cockeyed angle in
     the floor.  A FORENSIC TEAM is at work around the safe.
     They're chalking the outline around a body half obscured by
     the safe.

                               LT. SANTINO
               They say the rabbit got the safe idea
               from a cartoon he was makin' the other
               day.

                               VALIANT
               What a gasser.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Wait here...

     Santino walks to Acme's glassed office where a sobbing
     Jessica Rabbit is being interrogated.  We can only see her,
     not the person doing the interrogating.  Valiant sidles over
     to where the Forensic Guys are dusting the photographs he had
     taken for prints.  One of the Forensic Guys looks up from his
     work.

                               FORENSIC #1
               Say, didn't you used to be Eddie
               Valiant?

     Valiant ignores the slings and arrows and surveys the scene
     of the crime.  The door of the safe is ajar.  Valiant tries
     to look inside.  Forensic #2 closes the door with his knee.

     Now we HEAR the VOICE of Jessica Rabbit from behind them.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Mr. Valiant?

     Valiant turns to the voice.  WHAP!  Jessica slaps him hard
     enough across the face to make his head turn.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               I hope you're proud of yourself.

     She turns on her heel and storms off, sobbing into a
     handkerchief.  Valiant, rubbing his jaw, looks after her.  So
     do the Forensic Guys.

                               FORENSIC #1
               She likes you, Valiant.

                               FORENSIC #2
                      (low wolf
                       whistle)
               When they drew her, they broke the
               pencil.

     Now two WHITE-JACKETS from the Coroner's office start to
     carry Acme out on a stretcher.  As they pass Valiant, a hand
     still wearing a Hand Buzzer flops out.  Valiant grabs it --
     stopping the stretcher.

                               VALIANT
               Makes you wonder what in the world she
               was doin' with a guy who didn't clean
               his fingernails.


     CLOSE - HAND

     Imbedded under the fingernails is a reddish-brown substance.

                               FORENSIC #1
               So... it's blood.


     VALIANT

     peels a piece of it off... it chips and falls to the ground.
     He squats to examine it.

                               VALIANT
               It's not blood, it's paint.

     Suddenly the end of a cane comes down on Valiant's hand,
     pinning it to the floor.  Valiant follows the cane UP to it's
     gavel-shaped head -- past black pants, a black robe, to a
     cadaver-like complected face, and a large hooked proboscis.
     The head is shaved.  Rimless tinted glasses obscure the eyes.
     Although he's human, the total appearance is frighteningly
     vulture-like.  JUDGE DOOM is accompanied by Santino.

                               DOOM
               Is this man removing evidence from the
               scene of a crime?

                               LT. SANTINO
                      (deferential)
               Uh... no, Judge Doom.  Valiant here was
               just about to hand it over, weren't
               you, Valiant?

                               DOOM
               I'll take that.

     Doom takes his cane off Eddie's hand and reaches out for the
     paint chip.  Valiant palms a piece and drops a smaller piece
     into Doom's hand.  Doom examines it.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Looks like the deceased grabbed a
               handful of your client's pantaloons,
               Mr. Valiant.

     Valiant stands to face the Judge, who towers over him.

                               VALIANT
               He's not my client.  I was workin' for
               R.K. Maroon.

                               DOOM
               Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told
               us the rabbit became quite agitated
               when you showed him the pictures, and
               said nothing would stand in the way of
               him getting his wife back.  Is that
               true?

                               VALIANT
               Hey, pal, do I look like a
               stenographer?

                               LT. SANTINO
               Watch your mouth, Eddie, he's a judge.

     Doom smiles thinly at Valiant, tarns and walks with purpose
     towards the door.  Santino and Valiant follow.

                               DOOM
               The rabbit's movements are fairly clear
               after leaving the Maroon Studios.  He
               ran across the street, jimmied this
               door open, hoisted the safe on a block
               and tackle...


     EXT. ACME FACTORY

     Doom leads them outside and indicates a window.

                               DOOM
               ... then stood out here waiting for his
               prey.  After he cold-bloodedly
               accomplished his task, he went home.
               He was almost apprehended there by my
               men.

     Doom nods his head toward a group of sinister WEASLES (a la
     Disney's "Wind In The Willows").  They're loitering by a
     dogcatcher's wagon with "Toontown Control" on the side,
     cleaning their fingernails with switchblades and polishing
     Toon revolvers.
         
                               VALIANT
               Men?  They look more like weasles to
               me.

                               DOOM
               Yes, I find that weasles have a special
               gift for the work.
                      (turns back to
                       Valiant)
               The rabbit didn't contact you by any
               chance, did he?

                               VALIANT
               Why would he contact me?  I just took
               some lousy pictures.

                               DOOM
               So you wouldn't have any idea where he
               might be?

                               VALIANT
               Have you tried Walla Walla?  Kokomo's
               very nice this time of year.

     Doom steps into Valiant's face.

                               DOOM
               I'm surprised you aren't more
               cooperative, Mr. Valiant.  A human has
               been murdered by a Toon.  Don't you
               appreciate the magnitude of that?  My
               goal as Judge of Toontown, has been to
               rein in the insanity.  To bring a
               semblance of law and order to a place
               where no civilized person has ever been
               able to step foot.
               The only way to do that is to make the
               Toons respect the law.

     Suddenly a "YA-HA-HOOEY" interrupts his pontification, as a
     scruffy little TOON GOPHER comes hurtling over the wall from
     the Toontown side.  He's holding his blackened rear end...
     apparently the result of a run-in with a stick of dynamite.
     BONK!  The Gopher hits Doom in the back of the head, sending
     them both sprawling.  The Gopher picks himself up and shakes
     off the effects of the concusion.  When he sees who he's
     knocked down, he panics.

                               GOPHER
                      (petrified)
               Judge Doom!  Here, let me get that for
               ya.

     He whips a clothes brush out of his back pocket and furiously
     tries to clean the Judge's cloak.  Doom picks up the Gopher
     by the scruff of the neck and gets to his feet.

                               DOOM
               Why, you filthy little vagrant, you've
               soiled my robe!

                               GOPHER
               It's cleanin' up real good. Judge.

                               DOOM
               You've defiled a symbol of justice.

     As Doom carries the Gopher to the "Toontown Control" wagon,
     Valiant shoots a look to Santino.

                               VALIANT
                      (aside)
               Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?

                               LT. SANTINO
               No one knows.  He bought the election
               a few years back.  He's been rulin'
               Toontown ever since.

     When Doom gets to the wagon, the Weasles open up the back.
     In place of steel bars is a stream of fluid.  A Weasle turns
     a key and the flow of liquid stops.  The Gopher starts
     kicking furiously, trying to avoid the lock-up.

                                       GOPHER
                Oh, no, Judge, please, please, lemme
                go.  I think I hear my mother callin'
                me.

     Finally, the Gopher breaks free and makes a desperate dash
     for the wall.  Doom watches him run and calmly turns to where
     his car is parked.  It's a black Lincoln touring car with an
     ugly bird-like hood ornament.

                               DOOM
               Voltaire... the Gopher!

     Suddenly. the hood ornament SQUAWKS to life.  It's a hideous
     TOON VULTURE.  The Vulture flaps into flight.

     Just as the Gopher is about to make it over the top of the
     wall the Vulture's talons sink into his rear end and lift him
     airborne.  The Vulture drops the Gopher off with the Weasles.
     They pin him down.

                               GOPHER
               Hey, don't I have any rights?

                               DOOM
               Yes, you do... to a swift and speedy
               trial.

     One of the Weasles retrieves a briefcase from the sedan, puts
     it on the hood and snaps it open.  Twelve TOON KANGAROOS pop
     up, arranged in a jury box.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Court is now in session.

     He raps the Gopher on the head with the gavel end of his
     cane.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               The defendant is charged with vagrancy,
               assault and resisting arrest.  How do
               you find him?

     The Kangaroo court delivers the verdict instantly. Twelve
     LITTLE KANGAROOS pop up out of their Momma's pouches, holding
     up small cards, each with a letter spelling Y-O-U A-R-E
     G-U-I-L-T-Y.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Guilty as charged.  Case closed!

     Doom slams the briefcase shut.  He turns his attention back
     to the Gopher.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               I hereby sentence you to the dip!

                               GOPHER
               Oh no, not the dip!  Anything but the
               dip!  I'm too young to die...

     As the Judge pulls on a black rubber glove, the Weasles take
     out a stainless steel tub WHEEZING with sadistic glee.  They
     fill it from a spigot on the truck.

                               VALIANT
               What's with the dip?

                               LT. SANTINO
               That's how he gets rid of the
               troublemakers.  It's a combination of
               acetone, turpentine and paint remover.
               He calls it the...  Final Solution.


     THE GOPHER

     is wriggling and SCREAMING bloody murder as Doom lifts him up
     and holds him over the tub.  Then, as he's lowered into the
     solution, he starts to disappear. His pathetic SCREAMS are
     snuffed MID-YELP.

                               GOPHER
               Help!  Help!  He...

     The Gopher's gone.  All that's left of him is a paint slick
     on the surface of the liquid.

                               VALIANT
               Jesus.

     Doom pulls off the black rubber gloves finger by finger and
     hands them to a Weasle.  He turns to Valiant.

                               DOOM
                They're not kid gloves, Mr. Valiant.
                but that's how we handle things in
                Toontown.  I would think you'd
                appreciate that.

     He gets into his car, he pauses and looks back at Valiant.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               After all, didn't a Toon kill your
               brother?


     INT. TERMINAL BAR - DAY

     Dolores is behind the bar cutting lemon peels and preparing
     for the day's bartending.  There's one early customer, a
     grey-haired TROLLEYMAN in his Red Car uniform.  His hat's on
     the stool next to him and he's already drunk.  The door
     opens.  It's Valiant.  He walks over to the bar, reaches for
     a bottle and a shot glass and helps himself.  Dolores picks
     up a copy of the morning paper.

                               DOLORES
               Hey, Eddie, looks like you really
               stepped in it this time.

                               VALIANT
               What are you complaining about?  Here's
               your fifty bucks.

     Valiant slides the check across the bar.

                               TROLLEYMAN
                      (mumbling to
                       himself)
               Thirty-five years and all I got to show
               for it is a ticket punch.

                               VALIANT
               What's with Earl?

                               DOLORES
               A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some
               big company called Cloverleaf
               Industries.

                               VALIANT
               No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?

                               DOLORES
               Bastards put him on notice.

     Valiant picks up his glass. lifts it in toast to the
     Trolleyman.

                               VALIANT
               Here's to the pencil pushers.  May they
               all get lead poisoning.

     Now the Trolleyman unsteadily climbs up on his stool to get
     close to the Holy Grail... the Red Car route map over the
     bar.

                               TROLLEYMAN
                      (wistfully)
               The old Number Six Line... who'da
               thought they'd close that one down?

                               DOLORES
               Eddie, get him down from there.  He's
               gonna break his neck.

     Eddie grabs Earl around the legs and throws him over his
     shoulder like a sack of potatoes.  He carries him over to a
     booth and puts him down carefully, covering him with a
     tablecloth.

                               TROLLEYMAN
               Took you right to Toontown, it did.

                               VALIANT
               I know, I know... poor S.O.B.

     Valiant walks back to his drink at the bar.

                               DOLORES
               Do you think the rabbit did it?

                               VALIANT
               I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
               Make that a round.

     Valiant and Dolores look down the bar, but there's no one
     there.  Finally the familiar cowlick of Baby Herman rises to
     the top of the bar as he clambers up a barstool.

                               DOLORES
               We don't serve formula. Snookums.

                               BABY HERMAN
               You serve martinis, doncha?

                               DOLORES
               Yeah...

    Baby Herman slides his baby bottle down the bar to Dolores.

                               BABY HERMAN
               Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be
               wet.
                      (to Valiant)
               You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby
               Herman.

                               VALIANT
               I know who you are.  Kinda out of your
               neighborhood, aren't you?

                               BABY HERMAN
               Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a
               friend of mine's bein' framed.

                               VALIANT
               You mean the rabbit?  They got him
               cold.

                               BABY HERMAN
               You don't believe that.  I mean. the
               guy's an idiot, a moron, a complete
               fool...  but he'd never kill anyone.
               I know the guy.

     Dolores brings Baby Herman his baby bottle cocktail.

                               BABY HERMAN
                      (continuing)
               Thanks, doll.

     When Dolores turns around, Baby Herman pats her on the
     bottom.

                               DOLORES
                      (over her
                       shoulder)
               Oh, a ladies man, huh?

                               BABY HERMAN
                      (sotto voce; to
                       Valiant)
               My problem is I got a fifty-year-old
               lust and a three-year-old dinkie.

                               VALIANT
               My problem is I come here to drink in
               peace.  So if you don't mind...

                               BABY HERMAN
               C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole
               thing smell a bit funny to you?  I
               mean, no offense, but how did a
               mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in
               the first place?

                               DOLORES
                      (chiming in)
               Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an
               ad in the Yellow Pages.

                               VALIANT
               Thanks for the vote of confidence.

                               BABY HERMAN
               And another thing, the paper said no
               will was found.  But every Toon knows
               Acme had a will and, in it he promised
               to leave Toontown to the Toons.

                               VALIANT
               So where is it then?

                               BABY HERMAN
               Somebody took it from him.  That's what
               this whole thing's about.

                               DOLORES
               The papers said the safe door was
               opened, Eddie.

                               VALIANT
               Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya,
               Dolores?

                               BABY HERMAN
               My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always
               was after Acme's property.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?

     Valiant takes the paint chip out of his pocket and dangles it
     in front of Baby Herman.

                               BABY HERMAN
               No.  But neither does Roger.  That's
               Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise
               Orange.

                               DOLORES
               Well, I'll be...

                               BABY HERMAN
               So what's your next move, Valiant?

                               VALIANT
               My next move?  That's easy.  I'm
               gettin' up, and I'm walkin' out the
               door, and I'm goin' home to bed.

     Valiant stands.

                               DOLORES
               So you're not even gonna bother to find
               out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?

                               VALIANT
               He's a Toon... who cares?

     Baby Herman shakes his head sorrowfully.  As Valiant heads
     for the door, Dolores whaps her towel down on the bar.

                               DOLORES
               Well, you used to care, Eddie.  And it
               didn t matter if a client's skin was
               black, white, or painted!

     Valiant ignores her and walks out the door.


     INT. VALIANT'S HOUSE - DAY

     Eddie comes in the door with his coat over his shoulder.  He
     tosses the jacket over the chair and walks to the Murphy bed.
     He grabs the strap, and loosening his tie, walks away from
     the wall, pulling the bed down.  What he doesn't see is...


     ROGER RABBIT

     asleep in the bed.


     VALIANT

     still with his back to Roger, sits down exhaustedly on the
     bed and kicks off his shoes.  He lies back and pulls the
     covers over him.  He closes his eyes, rolls over to get
     comfortable.  Now he and Roger are nose-to-nose.  They both
     open their eyes at the same time.  They freak.

                               VALIANT
                      (screams)
               Aah!

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (screams)
               Aah!

     They both jump out of the bed.

                               VALIANT
               What the hell are you doin'?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I needed a place to hide.  I'm in
               trouble, Eddie.

                               VALIANT
               So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could
               get me a rap for aiding and abetting.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm
               here.

                               VALIANT
               Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my
               house?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, I asked the newsboy on the
               corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked
               a janitor, the fireman and finally the
               green grocer down the way.  He was very
               helpful.

                               VALIANT
               In other words, the whole goddamn world
               knows you're here!  Out!  Get out!

     Eddie tries to open the door, but Roger blocks it
     spider-like, arms and legs extended.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Please, Eddie, don't put me out.  I
               didn't do it, I swear.

     Valiant gives up trying to open the door and grabs Roger.  He
     pulls and he pulls.  Finally Roger snaps off like a broken
     rubber band.  The two of them go tumbling backward.  Valiant
     makes a grab for Roger but he slips out of his grasp like
     quicksilver.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               Sure I wanted to win Jessy back, but
               not that way.

     Valiant lunges again.  Roger dodges.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               After I left you, I went to see her at
               the Ink & Paint Club.

     Valiant picks himself up and tries to catch his breath.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               She was on stage, so I found a piece of
               paper and wrote her a love letter.

     Roger pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket and starts
     reading.

                                ROGER RABBIT
                       (continuing)
               'Dear Jessy.  How do I love thee?  Let
               me count the ways.  1-1000, 2-1000,
               3-1000...

     Valiant leaps for Roger and gets bim by the throat.  He rips
     the paper out of Roger's hand and crumples it up and throws
     it down.  He opens the door, throws Roger outside and quickly
     slams the door shut.  He leans against it, breathing hard.
     Suddenly, Roger comes through the mail slot like a limbo
     dancer.  Valiant, too tired to chase him, just watches him.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               Hey, that wasn't very nice.

     He retrieves the love letter, straightens it and puts it back
     in his pocket.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               It took me almost an hour to compose
               that.  But I decided not to leave it
               anyway.  I'd read it in person, that
               was my plan.

     Valiant crosses to the kitchen area where the dark room is
     still set up.  He opens the cabinet under the sink and comes
     out with a bottle of Scotch.  He takes a shot glass and pours
     himself one.

                               VALIANT
               Look, pal, if you're still here when I
               finish this drink, I'm callin' the
               police.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya.
               The police'll just dip me.  They were
               waitin' for me when I got home last
               night.  I ran.

                               VALIANT
               If you're so innocent, why'd you run?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always
               run.

     Valiant shoots the drink down and holds up the empty glass.
         
                               VALIANT
               That's it.

     He crosses to the phone on the counter.  He lifts the
     receiver and starts to dial.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, this is the moment of truth!  And
               I've spoken the truth, but you won't
               believe the truth.  So I guess the
               truth is my goose is cooked, my hash is
               slung. my fait is accompli.

     As Valiant finishes dialing, he idly puts the empty shot
     glass down on a photograph on the counter.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               Won't anything change your mind?

     Valiant turns from the pleading rabbit.  Now something he
     sees on the counter gets his attention.


     POV THROUGH SHOT GLASS

     The shot glass is resting on one of the reject pictures of
     Acme and Jessica.  The bottom of the glass is magnifying the
     back of the exuberant Marvin Acme.  Sticking out of his back
     pocket is a legal folder headed "Last Will and Testament".


     CLOSE - VALIANT

     He looks as if the truth has just hit him in the face.

                               VALIANT
               The goddamn will.

                               VOICE
                      (on phone)
               L.A.P.D.?

     Valiant slowly returns the phone to the cradle,

                               ROGER RABBIT
               You mean you believe me?

     Now outside we HEAR TIRES SCREECHING to a stop.  Roger runs
     to the window and pulls back the drapes.  His eyes bug out of
     his head.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               It's Toon Control!

     Valiant comes to the window and looks out, too.


     VALIANT'S POV

     The Toon Control wagon has stopped in front of the house.
     The Weasles pile out.  One of them takes what looks like a
     butterfly net out of the back.  Several others grab violin
     cases.


     EDDIE AND ROGER

     Valiant jerks Roger back behind the curtain.

                               VALIANT
               Get away from that window.

     Roger, elated, jumps into Valiant's arms.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               You're gonna help me?  How can I ever
               thank you?

     He plants a big wet Toon kiss on Valiant's lips.

                               VALIANT
               For starters... don't ever kiss me.


     EXT. BUNGALOW

     The Weasles are filing up the walk to the front door.  The
     leader pounds on the front door.

                               WEASLE
               Police...


     INT. BUNGALOW

     Valiant puts Roger down.

                               VALIANT
               I'll talk to 'em.  Find a place to
               hide.

     Roger zips to the closet door and goes inside.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Not in there.  That's the first place
               they'll look.

     Valiant goes to the closet and opens the door.  REVEAL Roger
     is now dressed in Eddie's trenchcoat and hat.  Playfully,
     Roger snaps one of the handcuffs onto Eddie's wrist.  He's
     got the Other attached to one of his wrists.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest!
               Just kidding...

                               VALIANT
               You idiot.  I lost the key for those
               cuffs.

     BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!  The KNOCKING is more impatient.  Valiant
     looks to the door.

                               WEASLE (O.S.)
               Open up!


     EXT. VALIANT'S DOOR

     The Weasles open the violin cases and take out real tommy guns
     and shoulder them in teams of two.  Suddenly they unleash a
     torrent of MACHINE GUN FIRE, making the outline of a weasle
     in the door with BULLETS.  The leader blows on the cut-out
     and it falls in.  The Weasles file through one by one.


     INT. APARTMENT

     The Weasles don't bother to look around.  They all just start
     BLASTING.  Bullets fly every which way.  The barrage destroys
     Valiant's apartment in a matter of seconds.  When the
     shooting stops and the smoke clears, the Weasles look around.
     The head Weasle spots blood all over the kitchen floor.

                                WEASLE #1
               We got him.

     But when he looks behind the counter, it's only a shattered
     ketchup bottle.


     EXT. REAR OF APARTMENT

     Eddie and Roger, handcuffed together, are beating it down the
     alley.  Roger, being a rabbit, is beating it a lot faster.
     He's kicking up dust, his legs are blur.  Valiant stumbles
     trying to keep up.  When they round the corner, Roger slams
     on the brakes, Toon style.  Valiant goes skidding past him and
     is jerked to a stop like a dog on a short leash.

                               VALIANT
               Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a
               Toon.

                               VALIANT
               Don't ever forget that.


     EXT. BUNGALOW - BACK WINDOW - THE WEASLES

     come piling out the window.  They start sniffing the ground.
     Suddenly one of them freezes on point, like a dog.  Another
     blows a HUNTER'S HORN and they're off on the trail.


     EXT. STREET - EDDIE AND ROGER

     emerge from the alley.  They pause momentarily to
     reconnoiter.  Eddie decides to go left, Roger right.  When
     they get to the end of the cuffs, they snap back into a pile.
     Valiant gets back to his feet and hauls Roger up angrily.

                               VALIANT
               This way, goof...

     They start across the street.  But Roger goes on one side of
     the Street sign, Eddie the other.  Roger coils around it like
     a tether ball.  Valiant yanks Roger off the sign and they
     duck across the street just as a trolley car passes.


     THE WEASLES

     come bloodhounding around the corner.  They search the street
     for signs of the fugitive.  But when they get to the trolley
     tracks, they stop, bewildered.

                               WEASLE #1
               Scent's cold.

                               WEASLE #2
               Pssst.

     He points toward the trolley car pulling into the Terminal
     Station.  They fall all over themselves scurrying over to the
     trolley.  They surround it and jump aboard, tommy-gun at the
     ready.


     INT. RED CAR

     The CONDUCTOR raises his hands like it was a hold-up.  A
     couple PASSENGERS scream as the Weasles search the car.  But
     no Roger or Eddie.  As quickly as they got on, they get off.


     EXT. RED CAR

     as it pulls away.  The Weasles look around perplexed.

                               WEASLE #1
               Funny... I could swear I smelled
               rabbit.


     ANGLE FROM ABOVE

     Eddie and Roger are balanced on the trolley wire above the
     Weasles' heads.  As the Weasles sniff around the barn, Eddie
     and Roger ease along the wire, using the wall of the Terminal
     Bar to lean on.


     INT. TERMINAL BAR - KITCHEN

     Dolores is preparing corned beef and cabbage.  The RADIO is
     PLAYING "MARES EAT OATS".  A NEWSCASTER breaks into the
     music.

                               NEWSCASTER
               News flash... Hollywood.  Citywide
               Toonhunt for Roger Rabbit, suspect in
               Acme slaying.  Police describe him as
               short, cuddly...  and psychotic.

     Dolores turns just as Roger's grinning face appears in the
     window.

                               DOLORES
                      (startled)
               Mother Mary...

     Now Eddie's face comes into view.  He motions for her to open
     the window.


     OUTSIDE THE WINDOW

     Roger and Eddie watch another trolley approach.  The contact
     arm sparks its way along the wire as it rolls along towards
     them.  Valiant watches as Dolores struggles to get the window
     open.

                               VALIANT
               Hurry, hurry...

     At the last second, the window opens.  Eddie jumps for the
     sill, Roger dangling from the cuffs as the trolley passes.


     INT. KITCHEN

     Dolores helps pull Valiant through the window.  Then he drags
     Roger inside.

                               DOLORES
               Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it
               is?

                               VALIANT
               Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.

     Roger bows at the waist, takes her hand and kisses it like
     Charles Boyer

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Charmed, enchanted, pleasure's all
               mined.

                               DOLORES
               Where'd you find him?

                               VALIANT
               The Toon Fairy left him under my
               pillow.

     Now Roger spots a plate of freshly shucked corn.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               May I?

     Before she can answer, he grabs an ear, presses it to his
     lips and applies the typewriter method to it.  When he gets
     to the end of a row, we even HEAR the BING!

                               DOLORES
               He's a riot.

                               VALIANT
               Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed
               to him.
                      (holds up
                       cuffs)
               Anybody in the back room?

                               DOLORES
               It's all yours.

     We FOLLOW Dolores as she leads Valiant and Roger across the
     hall.  She stops at a door, unlocks it, and leads them in.


     INT. BACK ROOM

     It's a tiny storage room/office with an institutional metal
     desk, a cot, and assorted janitorial supplies stacked around.
     Dolores shuts and locks the door behind her.  Valiant goes to
     a metal locker and digs through some tools, coming out with a
     hacksaw.  He sits on the cot and starts working on the cuffs.

                               DOLORES
               So you decided to help him after all?

                               VALIANT
               I oughta have my head examined.
                      (to Roger)
               Will you hold still?

     Roger quiets like a child for a moment as Valiant saws
     feverishly.  Then Roger slips his hand out of the cuff and
     holds his side while Eddie keeps sawing.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Does this help?

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, that's better.

     Valiant saws a couple more strokes before the realization of
     what Roger's done hits him.  His face darkens.  Roger sees
     the look and sheepishly tries to recover by sticking his hand
     back in the cuff.

                               VALIANT
               You mean to tell me you coulda taken
               your hand outta that cuff at any time?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, no, not any time.  Only when it
               was funny.

     Valiant looks at Roger like he's about to brain him.  Roger
     pulls his hand free again, and cowers out of range.  Valiant
     just rubs his forehead.

                               VALIANT
               Are you always this funny, or only on
               days when you're wanted for murder?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               My philosophy is if you don't have a
               sense of humor, you're better off dead.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah... well you just might get your
               wish.

                               DOLORES
               Can you get him out of it, Eddie?

                               VALIANT
               If I can find whoever wanted to kill
               Acme bad enough to get this.

     Valiant throws the pattycake picture down on the table.
     Dolores and Roger both examine it closely.

                               DOLORES
               Acme's will.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               So that's what this little drama is all
               about.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of
               the sound mind, your wife the sound
               body.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I resent that innuendo!  My wife is
               completely innocent.

                               VALIANT
               Your wife may be a lot of things, pal,
               but innocent isn't one of them.

                               DOLORES
               So what's the scam, Eddie?

                               VALIANT
               Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody
               wants Acme's property.  Cack the old
               man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the
               will.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               The habeus corpus is thickening.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't
               think they got the will.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               How do you know that?

                               VALIANT
               Well, Acme had the will in his pocket
               that night at the club.  It was gone in
               the morning when the cops found the
               body.

                               DOLORES
               Maybe they just took it out of his
               pocket.

                               VALIANT
               Then why'd they bother to crack the
               safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from
               Mount Baldy and it won't open.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your
               logic is specious.  What prevented Mr.
               Acme from putting the will back in the
               safe before they killed him?

                               VALIANT
               Because he's not forty feet tall.  The
               safe was up on the ceiling, remember?

     Dolores whistles over his deductions.

                               DOLORES
               Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow
               maybe I'll go down to probate court and
               see who's sniffin' around Acme's
               estate?

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle
               Maroon's cage.

     Valiant finishes sawing the cuffs.  He stands and throws the
     cuffs aside.  Valiant and Dolores go to the door.  Roger
     follows them eagerly.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               What should I do?  Who should I see?
               Where should I go?

     Valiant turns.

                               VALIANT
               Nothin', no one, nowhere,

     He slams the door.


     INT. POLO LOUNGE - CLOSE - MAROON

     He's in a booth in the middle of a business lunch.

                               MAROON
               Maybe money grows on trees in Toontown,
               but not at the Maroon Studio.

     WIDEN THE SHOT to REVEAL that Maroon's sharing a booth with
     BUGS BUNNY and his AGENT.  Bugs is chewing on a carrot.

                               BUGS BUNNY
               Look, Doc, fiduciary considerations
               aside, Roger Rabbit may have been
               willing to play second banana to an
               ankle-biter, but I ain't.


     ACROSS THE ROOM

     A MAITRE D' is leading Valiant and Augie, the deaf-mute to a
     table by the door.

                               VALIANT
               This'll be fine, huh, Augie?

      Augie nods his head.  They sit and pick up the menus.  Augie
      takes one peek and looks at Valiant, alarmed.  He scribbles a
      note.  Valiant reads it.

                               VALIANT
               Forget about the prices, pal.  If you
               want the shrimp cocktail, you have a
               shrimp cocktail.
                      (puts menu
                       down)
               Excuse me, Augie, I've got a little
               table-hopping to do.

      Valiant gets up from the table and starts across the room.


      AT MAROON'S BOOTH

                               AGENT
               I think you should know, R.K., we're in
               negotiations for Bugs to star in his
               own series at Warner Brothers.

                               MAROON
               Trying to scare up a bidding war
               between me and Jack Warner, eh?  Well,
               it won't work.  I'll call William
               Morris and I'll have 'em put out a
               rabbit call the likes of which this
               town's never seen!

                               BUGS BUNNY
               It's your dime, Doc.

                               MAROON
               And stop callin' me Doc!

                               BUGS BUNNY
               Eh, sure, Doc.

     Now Valiant arrives, pulls up a chair from next table and
     sits down.

                               VALIANT
               Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?

                               MAROON
               Valiant?  What're you doin' here?

                               VALIANT
               I Just thought I'd drop by and show you
               a photograph.

                               MAROON
               I've already seen your photographs.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, but I enlarged this one.  Thought
               you might be interested.

     Valiant takes an enlargement of the pattycake shot and puts
     it on the table in front of Maroon.  We can clearly see the
     will sticking out of Acme's pocket.

                               VALIANT
               Anyway... enjoy your lunch.

     Valiant stands and departs.  But his visit has done it's
     trick.  Maroon looks l'ike he's seen a ghost.  We FOLLOW
     Valiant across the room to his table where Augie is
     blissfully attacking a shrimp cocktail.

                               VALIANT
               How is that, Augie, pretty good?

     Augie nods enthusiastically.  Valiant keeps an eye on
     Maroon's booth.  Now he nudges Augie as Maroon excuses
     himself and goes into the phone booth just outside the door.
     Augie puts his shrimp fork down and picks up his pencil.


     AUGIE'S POV

     We see Maroon talk on the phone MOS.  As his lips move,
     Valiant supplies his words.

                               VALIANT (V.O.)
               It's me.  Valiant says there's a will.
               I don't know what he's trying to
               pull...


     BACK TO SCENE

     Valiant is reading of Augie's pad as Augie reads Maroon's
     lips, and scribbles down what he says.

                               VALIANT
                      (reading)
               Somebody's gonna have to take care of
               him.

     Augie looks up from his scribbling to exchange an eyebrow
     raising glance with Valiant.  Then he turns back to Maroon
     again.

                               VALIANT
                      (reading)
               The old man had it at the club that
               night.  That's right.  Yeah, I'm sure.
               I'll be there.

     Augie stops writing as Maroon hangs up the phone.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing; to
                       Augie)
               Where?

     Augie shrugs his shoulders.  Disappointed, Valiant lights a
     cigarette.  Now Augie elbows him and gestures across at
     Maroon, who's making another call.  Augie starts writing
     again.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing;
                       reading)
               Iris... cancel my appointments this
               afternoon.  I'll be at Forest Lawn.

     Maroon hangs up the phone and comes out of the phone booth.
     He hustles out of the room.  Valiant stands.

                               VALIANT
               You did great, Augie.  Have another
               shrimp cocktail.

     Valiant drops a twenty on the table and pats Augie on the
     back.


     EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL

     A CARHOP wheels a yellow Packard up in front.  Maroon climbs
     in and ROARS off.  Valiant ENTERS THE FRAME.  He looks after
     Maroon, then calmly starts walking down the driveway.


     EXT. FOREST LAWN CEMETERY - RED CAR STOP - DAY

     A Red Car pulls up.  Valiant climbs off.  He calmly crosses
     the street and ducks behind the cemetery entranceway as
     Maroon's Packard ROARS through.

                               VALIANT
                      (impressed)
               Love that Red Car.

     As Valiant starts to walk up the hill...

                                              CUT TO:


     THE ACME FUNERAL SITE - LONG SHOT - DAY

     A hearse, and a line of black limos are parked in the lane.
     Nearby, Marvin Acme's funeral is in progress.  Clustered
     around a gravesite are the mourners... TOONS of every stripe.
     There's MICKEY MOUSE comforting MINNIE.  TOM AND JERRY.
     HECKLE AND JECKLE.  CHIP 'N DALE.  Everyone from the famous
     to the not so famous is in attendance.  The eulogy is being
     delivered in a familiar blustery Southern VOICE.  It's
     FOGHORN LEGHORN.

                               FOGHORN LEGHORN
               Today we commit the body of brother
               Acme to the cold, I say cold, cold
               ground.  We shed no tears for we know
               that Marvin is going to a better place.
               That high, high, I say that
               high-larious place up in the sky.

     Foghorn Leghorn dramatically points skyward.

                               TOONS
                      (in unison)
               A-men!


     NEW ANGLE - VALIANT

     is leaning up against a palm tree on the hill.  We have been
     watching the proceedings from his POV.  Now he sees Maroon's
     car pull up.  He moves around to the other side of the tree
     as Maroon passes and starts wending his way through the
     crowd.


     AT THE GRAVESITE

     Foghorn Leghorn nods to the funeral DIRECTOR, a pasty-faced
     human in a black mourning coat.  The Director starts to turn
     the crank lowering the coffin into the grave.

                               FOGHORN LEGHORN
               Give us a sign, brother Herman, that
               you've arrived...

     Much to the funeral Director's amazement, the crank starts
     PLINKING Out the tune to "POP GOES THE WEASLE".  Now the Toon
     mourners pick up on it and join in.

                               TOONS
                      (singing)
               Round and round the mullberry bush, The
               monkey chased the weasle...

     The crank and SONG start going FASTER AND FASTER.

                               TOONS
                      (continuing;
                       singing)
               The monkey raid it all was in fun.  POP!
               Goes the weasle.

     Suddenly half of the lid to Acme's coffin flies open and a
     harlequin CLOWN BOI-YOI-YOINGS out.  The funeral Director
     faints dead away as the Toon SOBS turn to LAUGHTER.  The
     Toons turn and head away from the grave comforted by a
     funeral befitting a gag king.  They climb into their cars and
     SCREECH off like the start of the Indy 500.  One mourner is
     left at the gravesite.  Sitting in a chair dabbing at her
     eyes with a handkerchief is Jessica Rabbit.  Maroon walks up
     behind her.

                               MAROON
               So... trying to pull a fast one on me,
               huh?

     Jessica turns, startled.  She stands and faces Maroon.


     VALIANT

     smiles and leans in.  This is the moment he's been waiting
     for.  Now just as the conversation begins, it is drowned out
     by the NOISE from a LAWN MOWER.  Valiant turns to see a
     GARDENER riding around on a small tractor cutting the grass.
     Valiant tries to flag him down as he watches Maroon and
     Jessica having an arguement.  There's accusatory finger
     pointing.  In pantomime, Maroon gestures into his pocket as
     if describing the position of Acme's will.

     Jessica tries to leave.  He grabs her arm.  They're screaming
     at each other but we don't hear a word.  Valiant waves
     frantically for the Gardener to cut the machine.  But the
     Gardener misconstrues it as a friendly greeting and waves
     back.  Valiant turns in time to see Jessica kick Maroon in
     the groin and stomp off to a red Auburn Speedster.  She jumps
     in and speeds away as Maroon staggers back to his car.  The
     Gardener stops the tractor next to Valiant.  He SHUTS OFF THE
     ENGINE.  The cemetery is completely still again.

                               GARDENER
               Somethin' you want, mister?

                               VALIANT
               Not anymore...


     EXT. INK & PAINT CLUB - ALLEY - NIGHT

     A Steinway piano truck is parked next to the stage door.  TWO
     husky PIANO MOVERS are rolling a baby grand up the ramp to
     the stage door.  They knock on the door.  The Gorilla opens
     it and they muscle the piano inside.  After a moment, they
     reemerge.  We FOLLOW them back to the truck where a second
     baby grand stands ready to be moved.

                               MOVER #1
               I don't know about you, but it makes me
               sick to think of these beautiful pianos
               gettin' chopped into match sticks every
               night by those screwy ducks.

     Struggling, they push this second piano into the club.


     INT. CLUB - BACKSTAGE

     They roll the piano over to the wall and park it next to the
     first.

                               MOVER #2
                      (shakes head)
               And they call it entertainment.

     As they go out the stage door, MOVE IN on the baby grand.


     INSIDE THE PIANO - VALIANT

     is lying prone -- using the Steinway as his own Trojan Horse.
     He lifts the piano lid to climb out, but then HEARS FOOTSTEPS
     approaching.  He lowers the lid again.  Now someone starts
     testing the keys.  We see the hammers strike the strings,
     RUNNING UP THE SCALES until they reach the one under
     Valiant's nose.  The hammer whacks Valiant's nose on the
     backswing and strikes the string making a terrible SOUR NOTE.

                               DONALD DUCK (V.O.)
                      (exasperated
                       QUACK)
               Phooey!  Out of tune again!

                               DAFFY DUCK (V.O.)
               Not to worry, Donald.  We can fix that
               with my sledgehammer.

                               DONALD DUCK (V.O.)
               Never mind, Daffy.  I've got an axe in
               my dressing room.

     Valiant's eyes widen.


     ANGLE ON PIANO

     as the VOICES of Daffy and Donald recede, Valiant raises the
     lid and quickly climbs out.  He eases over to Jessica's
     dressing room.  As he starts to open the door, he HEARS
     SCUFFLING from inside.  Valiant puts his ear to the door.
     More SCUFFLING.  Valiant straightens, then suddenly whips the
     door open and flicks on the light.


     INT. DRESSING ROOM

     Nobody's there.  Perplexed, Valiant closes the door behind
     him and checks behind the dressing screen.  In the closet.
     No one.  He shrugs and starts to search the room.  He goes to
     Jessica's dressing table and rifles the drawers.  In her
     purse he discovers a Toon revolver.  He examines it.

                               VALIANT
               Girl's gotta protect herself.

     Valiant puts the gun back in the purse and closes the drawer.
     As he stands, he pauses to consider a Hurrel-like
     black-and-white photo of Roger Rabbit in a silver deco frame.
     He's dramatically posed with a cigarette like he was Tyrone
     Power.

     Valiant shakes his head and turns from the table.  Something
     catches his eye.


     ANGLE ON FLOOR

     Behind the dressing table, the corner of a piece of blue
     paper peeks out.  Valiant stoops down and fishes it out.
     It's a cover for a legal document -- "Last Will and Testament
     -- Marvin Acme".


     VALIANT

     stands, pleased.  He opens the blue folder.  But it's empty.
     Valiant puts it in his inside pocket and turns to go when
     suddenly an unseen hand flicks the lights off.

                               VALIANT
               Son of a bitch...

     We can't see anything in the darkness.  But we hear the SOUND
     of A FISTFIGHT.  There's the CRASHING of lamps and furniture
     breaking.  Now the door opens for a second as the assailant
     escapes.  Light floods in the room, illuminating Valiant on
     the floor with a curtain wrapped around his head.  As he
     struggles free the door closes.  The room is dark again.
     Valiant scrambles to the door.  When he whips it open, REVEAL
     the Gorilla framed in the doorway.  Valiant is frozen.  The
     Gorilla flicks on the light.  He smiles wickedly.

                               GORILLA
               And here I tought we had mice.

     Valiant tries to make a break for it.  WHAM!  The Gorilla
     lays him out cold with a right cross.

                                              BLACKOUT.


     FADE IN:

     VALIANT'S POV FROM FLOOR

     As his vision comes INTO FOCUS, Valiant sees the Gorilla,
     Jessica Rabbit, the Weasles and Judge Doom are standing over
     him.

                               GORILLA
               ... I caught him rummagin' around in
               here.  Then I called you, Judge, on a
               counta you be da one we pay juice to.

                               DOOM
                      (clears throat)
               You did the right thing, Bongo.


     THE WEASLES

     pull a groggy Valiant upright and plop him in a chair in
     front of Doom.

                               DOOM
               Being caught breaking and entering is
               not very good advertising for a
               detective.  What were you looking for,
               Mr. Valiant?

                               VALIANT
               Ask her...

     Valiant nods toward Jessica, who stands coolly smoking a
     cigarette.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Last week some heavy breather wanted
               one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe
               that's what he was after?

                               VALIANT
               Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I
               woulda broken into Frederick's of
               Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin
               Acme's will.

                               DOOM
               Marvin Acme had no will.  I should
               know, the probate is in my court.

                               VALIANT
               He had a will, all right.  She took it
               off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon
               knocked him off.  Then she set up her
               loving husband to take the fall.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               You, Mr. Valiant, are either drunk or
               punch drunk.  Probably both.

                               DOOM
               These are bold accusations, Mr.
               Valiant.  I hope you have some proof?

                               VALIANT
               I found the cover the will came in
               behind the dressing table.

     Valiant reaches into his pocket.  But the blue envelope is
     gone.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               They must've taken it off me.

                               DOOM
               They?

                               VALIANT
               The other people who were in here
               lookin' for the will.  I woulda caught
               'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted
               me.

     The Gorilla makes a move for Valiant.  Doom stops him.

                               DOOM
               Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr.
               Valiant our own way... downtown.

                               VALIANT
               Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of
               Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk
               to him.

                               DOOM
               Oh, not that downtown.  Toontown.

     The mention of Toontown has a visible impact on Valiant.

                               VALIANT
                      (nervous)
               You're not takin' me to downtown
               Toontown?

                               DOOM
               Indeed we are.  We'll continue the
               interrogation there.

                               VALIANT
                      (very agitated)
               I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me
               Santino.

                               DOOM
               You're a very stubborn man, Mr.
               Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show
               Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed
               men at the Toontown station...

     As the Weasles drag Valiant out of the room...

                               VALIANT
                      (screaming)
               No... you bastards!  Leggo of me!


     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     The Toon Control Wagon streaks along with the cat SIREN
     WAILING.  It flashes by then slams on the brakes at the
     entrance to an eerie tunnel.  A sign next to the tunnel says:
     "Toontown".


     INT. WAGON

     The Weasles look over at the bound and gagged Valiant.  One
     of them turns Valiant's head to look at the Toontown sign.

                               WEASLE #1
               What're you shakin' for?  Didn't you
               have a good time last time you were
               here?

     With a wicked WHEEZE, the driver floors it.


     EXT. TUNNEL

     The wagon disappears into the murky darkness.  PAN UP to the
     night sky.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:


     THE SKY - MORNING

     PAN DOWN to the tunnel.  We can't see into the darkness but
     we HEAR HOOTING and HOLLERING from within.  GUNS going off,
     FIRECRACKERS EXPLODING, WHIPS CRACKING, all accompanied by
     the WHEEZING LAUGHTER of the Weasles.

                               WEASLE #1 (O.S.)
               Soo-eey!  Soo-eey!

                               WEASLE #2 (O.S.)
               Let him go, boys.  I think he's got the
               message.

     After a beat, Valiant comes staggering out of the tunnel.
     He's got a burlap sack over his head tied around his waist.
     Behind him, the Weasles emerge holding paint cans and
     brushes.  They watch as he trips and falls by the side of the
     road.  The Weasles GIGGLE victoriously and head back inside.
     Valiant lies there for a moment, catching his breath.  Then
     he struggles to free his hands.  Finally he rips the sack off
     his head and sits up.


     CLOSE - VALIANT

     We see he's got a huge Toon pig with a goofy grin painted
     over his head.  Valiant pulls and tugs on it, but this is a
     costume that won't come off.  Valiant curses, gets to his
     feet and stumbles down the road.


     EXT. RED CAR STOP

     Valiant gets in the back of the line of PASSENGERS boarding
     the Red Car.


     INT. RED CAR - VALIANT

     steps aboard.  The Trolleyman, who we recognize as Earl from
     the Terminal bar, does a double-take when he sees the
     ridiculously silly looking man/Toon.

                               EARL
               Here's one for the books... a Toon
               wearin' human clothes.

                               VALIANT
               Earl... it's me, Valiant.

                               EARL
               Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?

                               VALIANT
               Toon cops worked me over.

                               EARL
               Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real
               Toon-a-Roo.

                               VALIANT
                      (apprehensively)
               What am I, Earl?

     Earl breaks the news to Valiant soberly.

                               EARL
               You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.

                               VALIANT
               No...

                               EARL
               Does it hurt?

                               VALIANT
               Not much.  It's hard to talk.

                               EARL
               Uh, Eddie, do me a favor.  Could you
               sit in the back so you won't cause as
               much of a commotion.

     Valiant tries to pull the brim of his hat down.  But it's
     comically small on the huge head.  He makes his way down the
     aisle past a veritable gauntlet of RAZZING, poking, tripping
     PASSENGERS.  Finally he finds an empty seat in the back as
     the Red Car starts up.


     A LITTLE KID

     wearing a baseball cap is sitting a few seats away with his
     MOTHER.  The Kid looks back at Eddie and laughs.  He leans
     over and whispers something to his Mom.

                               KID
               Can I, Mom?

                               MOMMY
               Go ahead, darling.  Take your bat.

     The Kid takes his baseball bat and approaches Valiant
     innocently.

                               KID
               Hi, Mr. Pig.  If I hit you on the head,
               will you make me a cuckoo bird?

     The Kid starts to take a swing with the bat.

                               VALIANT
               Kid, if you hit me on the head, I'm
               gonna throw you out this window.

     The Kid's eyes widen in terror.  This is not a typical Toon
     response.

                               KID
                      (crying)
                Mommy!


     INT. VALIANT'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

     We hear the SOUND of the SHOWER.  Valiant's hand reaches out
     past the shower curtain and grabs for a bottle.  But it's not
     shampoo.  It's turpentine.

                               VALIANT (O.S.)
               Dammit!

     CLOSE - TUB DRAIN

     The water swirling down the drain is tinged with paint of
     different colors.


     CLOSE - VALIANT

     He scrubs manically until the last of the pig head is gone.
     He rinses off and he feels around his face.  The absence of
     the Toon mask seems to bring him some relief.  He shuts off
     the shower and slides the shower curtain back.


     VALIANT'S POV - JESSICA RABBIT

     is leaning up against the doorjamb, dressed as usual, in a
     black cocktail dress with elbow length gloves and pearls.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the
               doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear
               it.

                               VALIANT
               That's because I don't have a doorbell.

     Jessica, caught in her lie, flutters her eyelids nervously.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.

                               VALIANT
               Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a
               towel.

     As she hands him a towel, she stares down at his anatomy.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               What's that thing?

     Valiant looks down at what she's referring to.

                               VALIANT
               Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a
               mole before?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Toons aren't given imperfections.

                               VALIANT
               No?  I guess we're not counting lying,
               stealing and murder.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               You've got the wrong idea about me.
               I'a a pawn in this just like poor
               Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll
               pay you anything.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta
               have the rabbit to make the scam work.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               No, no, no... I love my husband.

                               VALIANT
               Oh, sure.  I can just feature you
               standin' outside your little hutch,
               holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby
               to come home.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr,
               Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is
               being a woman looking the way I do.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it
               is bein' a man looking at a woman
               looking the way you do.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.

                               VALIANT
               I'm not complainin'.  But give me
               credit.  I'm the guy who took the
               pictures of you and Acme playin'
               pattycake, remember?

     Jessica takes a cigarette out of her purse.  She lights it
     and blows a cloud of Toon smoke.  It forms a recreation of
     what she describes.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Maroon came to me.  He told me he'd
               fire Roger if I didn't do it.  I went
               along with him for Roger's sake.  It
               was only pattycake, after all.

     Valiant waves at the smoke scene, dispelling it.

                               VALIANT
               So altruistic.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               It's the truth.  Why won't you believe
               it?

                               VALIANT
               Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I
               don't know what you're up to, lady, but
               I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               If I'm as bad as you think, what's
               stopping me from just killing you right
               now?

     Valiant reaches behind him and picks up a small cup on the
     sink.

                               VALIANT
               This cup of turpentine right here.  Go
               for that gun in your purse and I'm
               gonna let you have it.

     Jessica breaks down and starts sobbing.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Oh, Mr, Valiant, please... you're my
               only hope.

     She comes to Eddie and hugs him, burying her head in his
     shoulder.

                                JESSICA RABBIT
               I'm weak... you're strong.  Can't you
               find a place somewhere in your heart to
               help me?

     Valiant looks down at the luscious creature in his arms,
     considering the request.  The moment is interrupted by the
     CLEARING of a VOICE.

                               DOLORES (O.C.)
               Dabblin' in watercolors, Eddie?

     Valiant, still in just a towel, sheepishly turns to face
     Dolores, who's standing in the doorway.

                               VALIANT
               Dolores...

     Dolores regards Jessica with undisguised contempt.

                               DOLORES
               Lemme guess... your cousin from Des
               Moines?

     Jessica straightens her dress.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Perhaps I should go.

                               DOLORES
               Must you?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Goodbye, Eddie... don't hate me.

     Jessica blows Eddie a TOON KISS which flies across the room,
     landing on Eddie's cheek.  She saunters past the smoldering
     Dolores and out the door.  Dolores walks to Eddie and peels
     the kiss off his cheek.  She crumples it up and throws it
     down in the wastebasket.

                               DOLORES
               What was that?

                               VALIANT
               That was the rabbit's wife.

                               DOLORES
               The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what
               she was doin' with her arms around you?

                               VALIANT
               Probably lookin' for a good place to
               stick a knife.

                               DOLORES
               I just stopped by to tell you that I
               checked out the Acme probate.

                               VALIANT
               Maroon, right?

                               DOLORES
               Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit
               again.

                               VALIANT
                      (startled)
               What the hell would they want with a
               gag factory?

                               DOLORES
               Got me.  But unless the will shows up
               by Friday midnight, it's theirs.

     As Valiant considers this new development, he cocks an ear.
     In the distance, we HEAR FAINT SINGING.

                               VALIANT
               What's that comin' from the bar?

                               DOLORES
                      (listens)
               Sounds like singin'.

                               VALIANT
               Oh, no...

     As Valiant grabs his pants...

                                              CUT TO:


     INT. TERMINAL BAR - DAY

     Roger's out all right.  In fact, he's using the bar as a
     stage for a song and dance number.  The tune is extremely
     familiar.  In fact, it's the one that opens every Warner
     Brothers cartoon...  The Looney Tune Anthem.  But we've never
     heard words to go with it.

                               ROGER RAB3IT
               'The merry-go-round broke down
               But you don't see me frown...'

     Roger grabs Augie's pad and pencil, scribbles some drawings
     lightning fast.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               'Things turned out fine
               And now she's mine...'

     Roger flips through the pad which in crude animation, shows
     the story of Roger and Jessica getting back together,
     culminating in them kissing in a heart.  Augie's delighted.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               '... Cause the merry-go-round
               Went round...
               Hoo-hoo, Hoo-hoo...'

     Roger does backflips and acts like an escapee from the acute
     ward.


     THE DOOR OPENS

     Eddie and Dolores enter.  Valiant stops in his tracks at the
     sight of Roger's performance... and the smiles on the faces
     of the sourpusses.


     CLOSE - ROGER

     doesn't see Eddie.  He moves into the next verse.  He twirls
     around on the post.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               'My name is Roger Rabbit
               I've got a crazy habit
               I like to sing and dance and yuk...'

     Roger goes to Angelo, lifts off his cap, and whacks his
     toupee, making it spin like a top.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               '... So brighten up and smile
               You schmuck'.

     All the regulars in the bar have a good laugh at that one.
     Now as Roger twirls around on the post, he smashes into a bar
     tray held by Eddie.  Valiant carries him toward the back
     room, but the irrepressable entertainer gets on his knees Al
     Jolson style and blows kisses to his audience.  The regulars
     are HOWLING as Roger is carried out.


     INT. BACK ROOM

     Valiant flings Roger into the room and slams the door behind
     him.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hey, don't I get an encore?

                               VALIANT
               Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out
               there riskin' my neck for you.   I come
               back here and you're singin' and
               dancin'.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               But that's my calling, my purpose, my
               raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to
               make people laugh... and believe me,
               those people needed a laugh.

                               VALIANT
               And when they're done laughin' , they're
               gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo
               would rat on you for a nickel!

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...

                               VALIANT
               An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He
               just got outta prison.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well... I still don't think he'd turn
               me in.

                               VALIANT
               Just because you got 'em to laugh?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie.
               Sometimes it's the only weapon we have
               in life.

                               VALIANT
               I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson
               variety.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I've met some cynical and miserable
               humans in my time.  But you, Edward
               Valiant, are positively funereal!

                               VALIANT
               Well, right now it's gonna be your
               funereal.

     Valiant takes his fist back to belt Roger.  Roger stands
     stoicly, jaw thrust forward, eyes closed.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Go ahead and throw that punch.
                      (opens one eye)
               But you'd be more successful with a
               punch line.

     Valiant drops his fist and rubs his temples with frustration.

                               VALIANT
               You're driving me crazy, you know that?
               Let's go... you ruined this as a hiding
               place.

     Valiant grabs Roger by the scruff of the neck and opens the
     door.  But he ducks back in quickly.


     VALIANT'S POW - THROUGH DOOR - JUDGE DOOM

     has entered the bar.  He stands FRAMED in the doorway,
     Voltaire perched on his shoulder.  The red light of the neon
     sign flashes on his glasses making him look like he's got
     burning coals for eyes.  With the Weasles at the door backing
     him up, the satanic Doom walks to the bar, his FOOTSTEPS
     CREAKING along the wooden floor.  He surveys the scene, leans
     over the bar for a glass.  Doom holds the glass up to the
     light and looks at it disgustedly.  He picks up a bottle of
     scotch and carries it down to where the one-armed Soldier is
     sitting.  Doom stares at him, then pulls the empty sleeve out
     of the amputee's pocket.  He uses it to wipe the inside of
     the glass.

                               DOOM
               I'm looking for a rabbit.  He was last
               seen in this neighborhood.

     The barflies avoid Doom's stare and shoot covered glances to
     one another.  But nobody says a word.  Doom pours a drink
     into his newly cleaned glass... then gently pours it down
     Voltaire's gullet.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               You couldn't miss him.  Buck teeth.
               Orange pants.  About yea big.

     Doom squashes the Midget's head down to approximate the size.

                               DOLORES
               There's no rabbit here, so don't harass
               my customers.

     Doom turns to Dolores.

                               DOOM
               I didn't come here to harass.  I came
               here to reward.

     Doom walks around Dolores toward the back.  But Doom stops
     next to the blackboard.  On it is written:  "Today's Special
     - French Dip - $ .50".  Doom erases the "French" and the
     decimal point in front of the "50".  Then he picks up the
     chalk and starts to write.  The CHALK SQUEAKS excruciatingly
     on the blackboard.  Everyone winces but watches anyway, as
     Doom writes "Rabbit" where the "French" was, and adds the
     zeroes to the "50".  It now reads:  "Rabbit Dip - $5000".


     AT THE BAR - ALL EYES

     are fixed on the figure on the blackboard.  Angelo licks his
     lips.

                               ANGELO
               Hey, I seen a rabbit...

     Angelo looks defensively at all his cronies and back to Doom.

                               ANGELO
                      (continuing)
               He's right here in the bar.

     But instead of pointing to the back of the bar, he talks to
     the empty barstool beside him.

                               ANGELO
                      (continuing)
               Say 'ello, Harvey.

     The tension is broken.  Everybody at the bar starts HOWLING.


     INT. BACK ROOM

     Roger turns to Eddie victoriously.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               My pal.


     IN THE BAR

     Doom stares down the regulars until the laughter stops.
     Meanwhile, a Weasle has started sniffing around the bar where
     Roger was dancing.  As Doom turns to leave, the Weasle
     whispers in his ear as he points to the back.  Doom smiles
     and pats the Weasle on the head.  He turns to Angelo and the
     others.

                                        DOOM
                Now we'll see who laughs best...

     The Weasle bloodhounds through the bar with Doom striding
     after him.  We FOLLOW them to the door to the back room.
     Doom rips the door open.


     INT. BACK ROON

     It's dark.  Doom flicks on the light.  REVEAL Valiant on the
     cot, his pint bottle cradled in his arm.  He blinks as if
     awakened from a drunken slumber.

                               DOOM
               Valiant?  Why is it that whenever my
               men smell a rabbit, you're there?

     Valiant plumps the pillow behind his head.

                               VALIANT
               Must be my cologne... Eau Dc Carrot.

                               WEASLE #1
                      (sniffs)
               He's in here all right, boss.

     Suddenly the Weasle grabs the pillow from under Valiant's
     head and carves it to shreds with a switchblade.  Feathers
     fly.  But no rabbit fur.

                               WEASLE #2
               Youse want we should take the place
               apart?

     The rest of the Weasles are arrayed behind Doom with Toon
     crowbars, picks, and a jackhammer.

                               DOOM
               No, Sergeant.  That won't be necessary.

     Doom walks over to the locker.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               I know a trick that no Toon can resist.

     Doom raps on the locker with his knuckles.  Da-da-da-da-da...
     It's a familiar pattern that demands a Da-da response.  Doom
     moves to the desk and tries it again.  Da-da-da-da-da...


     INSIDE A MAXWELL HOUSE COFFEE CAN

     Roger is hiding while sweating out the urge to finish the
     familiar coda.  We HEAR the RAPPING again, closer.
     Da-da-da-da-da...  Roger's biting his nails.


     DOOM

     moves to the milk crate the coffee can is on.  Valiant gets
     up off the cot.

                               VALIANT
               You know, Doom, I don't know who's
               Toonier, you or the rabbit.

     Doom just smiles and knocks the pattern out on the crate.

                               DOOM
               Shave... and... a haircut...

     Roger bursts out of the can with the lid on his head.  He
     responds con brio.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Two... bits!
                      (looks around)
               Uh... oh...

     PSSSHEW!  Roger flies out the door.


     INT. THE BAR

     He streaks across the bar and out the front door.   After a
     beat, two Weasles step into the bar holding the butterfly net
     they had stretched across the door.  They WHEEZE with glee at
     the struggling Roger trapped inside.  A third Weasle carries
     the Judge's briefcase.

     Doom strides confidently into the bar.

                               WEASLE
               Oyez... oyez... oyez... court is now in
               session.

     Valiant and Dolores are led out by a couple Weasles holding
     guns on them.  As Doom snaps the briefcase open on the bar,
     the twelve Kangaroos pop up in their jury box.  Doom raps on
     the bar with his gavel-headed cane.  The regulars watch the
     bizarre scene in stunned silence.

                               DOOM
               Roger Rabbit is charged with the cold
               blooded murder of a human... Marvin
               Acme.  The jury will direct their
               attention to exhibits A, B, and C.

     The Weasles display photographs of Jessica and Acme playing
     pattycake, a blow-up of his fingerprints spelling
     RogerRabbitRogerRabbit in the whorls on the photographs, and
     a picture of Acme lying under the safe.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Motive, evidence, modus operandi.  How
               do you find the defendant?

     Once again the Kangaroo court wastes no time delivering the
     verdict.  The Baby Kangaroos pop up with their Y-O-U A-R-E
     G-U-I-L-T-Y signs.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Guilty as charged.  Case closed!

     Doom slams the briefcase shut.  Now two Weasles wheel the
     stainless steel tub filled with dip into the bar.  Another
     hands Doom his black rubber gloves.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               For this heinous crime, I sentence you
               to the dip!

                               ROGER RABBIT
               No, no. not the dip!  Eddie, tell him
               I didn't do it!

                               VALIANT
               I don't think it's gonna matter.
               Sorry, pal, I tried.

                               DOOM
               Yes, and for that you're charged with
               aiding and abetting.  But we'll let
               Santino handle that.

     Doom pulls on the rubber gloves.

                               VALIANT
               Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last
               request?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs?
               Just kidding.

                               VALIANT
               I think you want a drink.
                      (to Doom)
               How about it, Judge?

                               DOOM
               Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous
               tonight.  The successful conclusion of
               this case draws the curtain on my
               career as a jurist. I'm retiring to
               take a new role in the private sector.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to
               give you a gold watch.

     Valiant pours a glass of whiskey filling it all the way to
     the rim.  He holds it out to Roger.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper
               for me.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               But, Eddie, you know what happens
               when...

                               VALIANT
               Drink it, jerk.  All of it.

     He grabs Roger's hand and forces the drink into it.  Roger
     shrugs his shoulders and shoots the drink down.  We've seen
     the reaction before.  Suddenly Roger's head turns into a
     STEAM WHISTLE emitting such a PIERCING BLAST that is sends
     everyone into ear-grabbing agony.  Glasses, bottles, mirrors,
     even Doom's glasses SHATTER.  Valiant uses the distraction to
     punch the Weasles holding Roger.  He grabs the rabbit by the
     scruff of the neck. He gets as assist from Augie, who
     couldn't hear the noise.  Unfazed, Augie whacks a Weasle on
     the head with a barstool.  The Midget crawls behind Doom,
     who's been momentarily blinded.  The one-armed Soldier pushes
     him over.  Angelo is turning one Weasle's head around and
     around like a cruller.  Finally, Doom gets to his feet.

                               DOOM
               After them you fools...

     As the Weasles regroup, Valiant tips the stainless steel tub
     over sending the dip spilling toward them.  The Weasles
     recoil from the liquid.  Even Doom takes a step backward.


     EXT. TERMINAL BAR

     Eddie and Roger race down the stairs and toward the Toon
     Control Wagon which is parked in front of Doom's Lincoln,

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'.
               Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the
               noodle, the grey matter...

                               VALIANT
               If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin'
               from the law with a Toon?

     Valiant opens the door of the Toon Control wagon, and flings
     Roger inside roughly.


     INT. CAB

     Eddie goes to start the vehicle but the key is gone.   Now
     from behind them comes a DEEP RUMBLING VOICE somewhere
     between Lord Buckley and Barry White.

                               VOICE
               Excuse me, gentlemen...

     Eddie and Roger turn.  A snazzy TOON ROADSTER whose grill
     functions as it's mouth is talking from behind the liquid
     bars.

                               ROADSTER
                   If you effect my extrication, I
                   could offer you some carburetion.

     Valiant sighs with resignation and slides out of the cab,
     Roger in tow.


     EXT. REAR OF WAGON

     Eddie and Roger come racing around the side of the wagon.
     Valiant searches the back of the truck for the on/off switch.
     He finds it and turns off the flow of acetone.  The Roadster
     zips out of the truck and lands on the pavement, already
     flexing and limbering.   Behind him, a comical number of other
     TOON DETAINEES hop out like midgets out of a Volkswagon.

     They all head for the hills.

                               ROADSTER
               Well... what're we waitin' for, the
               William Tell Overture?


     ANGLE ON TERMINAL BAR - THE WEASLES

     come piling out.  They stack up like an Indian totem pole
     searching every direction.  One of them spots Eddie and
     Roger.  The Weasles stumble all over themselves in a mad
     scramble down the stairs.


     EDDIE AND ROGER

     hop into the sleek two-seater.   Valiant looks at the myriad
     of goofy cartoon gauges and switches on the Roadster's
     dashboard.

                               VALIANT
               What do I do?

                               ROADSTER
               You don't have to do nothin'...

     With a ferocious RUBBER BURNING SQUEAL, the Roadster ROARS
     off in "no frames".  The exit is so fast that Eddie and Roger
     are left behind, hanging mid-air.  But before they hit the
     ground, the Roadster zips back INTO FRAME.  Eddie and Roger
     fall back into their seats.  The Roadster bends around so his
     grill is facing them.

                               ROADSTER
                      (continuing)
               Uh... except hang onto your hat.

     The Roadster ROARS off again in a cloud of Toon dust.


     INT. SANTINO'S COP CAR

     coming the other way.  It's followed by another squad car,
     both with SIRENS BLARING.  When the red blur streaks by, Lt.
     Santino turns to his PARTNER.

                               LT. SANTINO
               What the hell was that?

                               PARTNER
               Speeding rabbit, Lieutenant.

                               LT. SANTINO
               That's what I was afraid of.


     EXT. STREET

     Santino's car does a 180 degree spin, and goes after the
     Roadster.  The second squad car follows.  The Weasles pile
     into the Toon Control wagon and join the chase.


     INT. THE ROADSTER

     rockets down the street, then takes a turn so wide that it
     drives up the front of the corner building, then back down on
     the sidewalk, just avoiding a newsstand.  The squad car
     following is not so dexterous.   It CRASHES into the stand,
     sending newspapers flying.


     THE ROADSTER

     looks back over it's shoulder, admiring his handiwork.

                               ROADSTER
               Read all about it, Benny's back in
               town!

     Up ahead, an egg delivery truck is double-parked in their
     lane.  Benny snaps around just as they're about to crash into
     the back of the truck.  There's nowhere to go.   But Benny's
     cool.

                               ROADSTER
               Going up...

     Suddenly, just before impact, the Toon suspension on the car
     accordions up, giving it a clearance of about fifteen feet...
     just enough to get over the truck.


     THE TOON CONTROL WAGON

     doesn't come with this unique feature.  It tries to avoid the
     truck but SMASHES into the back, splattering hundreds of eggs
     and sending the Weasles flying.


     EDDIE AND ROGER

     look down from their suspended position at the chaos behind.

                               ROADSTER
               Next floor, sundries, knick knacks,
               escaped convicts.  Watch your step.

     The Roadster accordions back down to it's original height and
     speeds past TWO MOTORCYCLE COPS.  The motorcycles ROAR after
     them.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hey, Benny, what were you in for?

                               ROADSTER
               Reckless driving.  Do you believe that?

                               VALIANT
               Hard to imagine.

     Benny zig-zags through traffic, scooting between cars, but
     the Motorcycle Cops manage to stay on his tail.  Up ahead,
     traffic is stopped in his lane.  With nowhere to go, Benny
     passes a trolley car moving down the center of the street.
     Suddenly, he swerves in front of the trolley to elude the
     Cops... only to see another Red Car coming the other way.

                               ROADSTER
               Hold your breath, babies...

     Benny sucks in his girth and gets on his tip-toes as the
     trollies pass on either side of them.


     WIDE SHOT

     When the trollies clear, Benny staggers out from between them
     still on tip-toes.  Benny plops down, squashes, then pops up
     to his old self again.


     BEHIND THEM

     The crippled Toon Control wagon is struggling to keep up.
     Voltaire circles above the truck and picks two Weasles up off
     the roof.  They're each carrying several sticks of dynamite.


     FROM THE AIR

     We see Voltaire flying after the Roadster, which is speeding
     along the palm-lined Elysian Park Drive.  The Weasles light
     the dynamite sticks and with WHEEZING delight, bombard the
     car below.


     BENNY

     swerves right and left dodging the EXPLOSIONS.  Now a stick
     of dynamite falls into the back seat, fuse burning.  Benny
     looks back.

                               ROADSTER
               Hate to sound like Chicken Little, but
               is the sky falling or what?

     Eddie and Roger turn to see the dynamite, fuse burning low.
     Valiant makes a desperate grab for it.  But it rolls under
     the front seat.  Roger jumps in Eddie's lap.


     ABOVE - VOLTAIRE AND THE WEASLES

     satisfied that they've hit their target, swoop back to the
     Toon Control wagon.


     IN THE ROADSTER

     Valiant tries to untangle himself from Roger.

                               VALIANT
               Grab it, you idiot!

     Finally, at the last second, Roger reaches down and picks the
     dynamite up like a hot potato.  He flips it out of the
     Roadster.


     THE DYNAMITE

     spins through the air, finally landing on the roof just as
     Voltaire and the Weasles arrive.  BOOM!  The Toon Control
     wagon is demolished.  When the smoke clears we see the
     Weasles and Voltaire scattered roadside, faces blackened,
     feathers smoking.


     EXT. ECHO PARK STREET

     Benny is leading a merry chase up and down the hills.  Beside
     the two Motorcycles, there are half a dozen squad cars.  But
     as Benny comes over the last rise, we see the road deadends
     at Echo Park Lake.  The police have blocked off the
     perpendicular streets with squad cars.  Eddie and Roger see
     the deadend fast approaching.  Roger covers his eyes with his
     ears.  Valiant braces himself.

                               VALIANT
               The brakes!  The brakes!

     Benny hits the brakes.  Smoke pours out as they burn up and
     the momentum is barely broken.

                               ROADSTER
               Forget the brakes, who brought the
               water wings?

     The Roadster SMASHES through the wooden guard rail and sails
     out over the water.  KERPLOP!  It splashes down in the lake.


     THE POLICE CARS

     SCREECH to a stop at the edge of the lake.  Santino jumps out
     and regards the floating Roadster.  He turns to the other
     cops with a smirk.  When he turns back again, the smirk
     disappears from his face.


     ANGLE ON LAKE

     Benny is calmly swimming away using his fenders to do the
     crawl.  Now they pass a spooning COUPLE in a rowboat.  The
     couple regard them open-mouthed.


     THE EDGE OF THE LAKE

     Benny nears the shoreline, touches bottom and wades out.
     When they hit dry land, Benny shakes off like a dog.  He REVS
     HIS ENGINE.

                               ROADSTER
               Maybe it's my imagination, but I always
               seem to run better after I've had a
               wash.
                     (turns)
               Now where can I drop you cats?

     As Benny ROARS off...

                                              CUT TO:


     EXT. ALLEY - DAY

     Benny peeks around the corner, then tip-toes into view. down
     the alley until he stops in front of a back door.  Eddie and
     Roger climb out.

                               VALIANT
               Thanks, Benny.

                               ROADSTER
               If you ever need me, just stick out
               your thumb.

     WHOOSH!  Benny is gone.  Valiant goes to the door and unlocks
     it.  As he and Roger head up the back stairs...

                                              CUT TO:


     INT. BUILDING - CLOSE - DOORWAY

     A hand painted design on the rippled glass shows a knight on
     a white charger.  On the shield in bold letters it says,
     "Veritas".  And lettered around it -- "Valiant and Valiant -
     Private Investigation".


     VALIANT

     sticks his key in the door and unlocks it.  Roger studies the
     banner.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other
                Valiant?

                               VALIANT
                My brother.  Get inside.

     He pushes Roger into the office.


     INT. OFFICE

     It's a typical detective office -- a couch, a sink, a window
     -- except for the partner's desk in the middle of the room.
     There's a chair on each side.  Valiant closes the door and
     locks it.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                So what's our plan, our scenario, our
                modus operandi?

                               VALIANT
                We can't do anything till it's dark.

     Valiant picks up some yellowed newspapers off the couch and
     dumps them on the floor.  They leave a clean spot on the
     couch.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Guess you haven't been here in a while.
                     (reads
                      headline)
                'Japs Bomb Pearl Harbor'.

     Roger walks over to the wall.  He takes a framed picture off
     the wall which shows two guys clowning with Mickey Mouse.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Say, who's this guy laughin'?

                               VALIANT
                Me.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've
                never seen you laugh before.  That your
                brother makin' the rabbit ears?

                               VALIANT
                What is this, Twenty Questions?

     Valiant grabs the picture from Roger and re-hangs it.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
                I'm gonna get some sleep.  I suggest
                you do the same.
         
     Valiant stretches out on the couch.  Roger nudges him to move
     over so he can lie down.  Grudgingly, Valiant slides over a
     fraction giving Roger a tiny piece of the couch.  They lie
     head to foot.


     CLOSEUP - VALIANT

     The problems of the day are knitting his brow.  Finally his
     eyes close.  After a beat, we HEAR Roger SNORING.  It's LOUD.
     Valiant's eyes pop open.  He rolls over.  WIDEN THE SHOT to
     see what he sees.


     ABOVE ROGER'S HEAD - A TOON DREAM BUBBLE

     has appeared.  Inside the bubble is a saw sawing back and
     forth through a log.  It is SYNCHRONIZED to the SOUND of
     Roger's SNORE.  Valiant kicks Roger, trying to stop the
     infernal SOUND.

     Roger sits up.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Huh?

     In the dream bubble, the saw cuts through the log.  One end
     of the log falls out of the bubble and BONKS Roger on the
     head, knocking him unconscious.  Valiant shakes his head and
     closes his eyes again.  We PAN UP off his face and PAST the
     window where the sun is setting.  As the CAMERA MOVES ALONG
     THE WALL, we see a gallery of framed newspaper clippings.
     "Valiant and Valiant Crack Popeye Kidnapping - Return Sweepea
     to Loving Arms of Parents".  And... "Brothers Find Brothers:
     Heckle and Jeckle Rescued From Redwood Forest!"  And...
     "Goofy Cleared of Atomic Spying Charges".  The PAN CONTINUES
     until we get to the window again.  Now it's dark outside.
     MOVE DOWN to Valiant's sleeping face.  He stirs. then opens
     one eye.  Now they both pop open at what he sees.


     VALIANT'S POV

     Roger has a magnifying glass an inch in front of his face
     that distorts his grinning face hideously.


     VALIANT

     startled from his sleep, reflexively shoves Roger away from
     him.  He flies into a swivel chair and goes spinning around.

                               VALIANT
                You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked
                you for the patsy.  Always gotta play
                the fool.  You make me sick!

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience,
                but what happened to you that was so
                dark, lurid, embittering?

                               VALIANT
                You wanna know?  Well, since you're so
                goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of
                you Toons killed my brother.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                A Toon?  Noooo.

                               VALIANT
                Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who
                killed Bambi's mother.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous,
                despicable... a smear on the drafting
                board.

                               VALIANT
                Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and
                Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All
                Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em.
                And when this guy was accused of
                knockin' over the First National Bank
                of Toontown, we took his case.  But
                when we looked into it, we found out he
                did do it after all.  We went to his
                house to take him in.  But he was wise.
                He got the drop on us... literally.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (wincing)
                Safe?
         
                               VALIANT
                Piano.  Guy got away, disappeared into
                Toontown.  Nobody ever saw him again.

     Now the PHONE on the desk RINGS.  Roger makes a move to it.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                I'll get it.

                               VALIANT
                Get away from there.

     The PHONE RINGS TWO MORE TIMES and stops.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Wrong number?

                               VALIANT
                No, it's not.

     Valiant goes to the phone anticipating a RING which comes
     after a moment.  Valiant picks up the receiver.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Dolores?
         
                                              INTERCUT:


     DOLORES

     on the phone in the Terminal Bar.

                               DOLORES
               I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's
               called here about four times.  He says
               he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He
               says he can help you.

                               VALIANT
               I'll bet.

                               DOLORES
               Are you gonna call him, Eddie?

                               VALIANT
               What've I got to lose?  You okay,
               Dolores?

                               DOLORES
               Yeah... they closed me down for a
               coupla weeks.

                               VALIANT
               That'll work out just fine.  When this
               thing is over, I'll take you to
               Catalina.  How does that sound?

                               DOLORES
               Familiar.  Be careful, Eddie.

     Dolores hangs up the phone.

                                              INTERCUT TO:


     VALIANT

     He CLICKS the switchhook and dials.
         
                               VALIANT
               Maroon?  Whaddaya want?

                               MAROON
                      (on phone)
               Have you got the will?

                               VALIANT
               Maybe.  Why?

                               MAROON
                      (on phone)
               Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock.
               If you've got the will maybe we can
               stop this thing.

                               VALIANT
               Stop what?

     CLICK.  Maroon has hung up.  Valiant hangs up the phone and
     goes to a wall safe.  He spins the combination.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are
               ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine
               o'clock.

                               VALIANT
               That's why I'll be there at 8:45.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I tell you what, maybe I better come
               with you.

                               VALIANT
               Forget it.

     Valiant reaches into the safe for a .38 revolver.  He checks
     the cylinder. Then he takes out a wooden box about 8" X 12".
     He closes the safe, picks up a black doctor's bag and puts
     the box and the revolver into it.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a
               chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you
               think.

                               VALIANT
               How much is a shave and a haircut,
               Roger?

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (sheepish)
               Two bits.

                               VALIANT
               I rest my case.

     Valiant goes to the door, pauses.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               If I don't make it back here by ten...

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yeah?

                               VALIANT
               ... I'd head for Cucamonga.

     Valiant closes the door, leaving Roger alone.  Roger paces
     back and forth manically.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Cucamonga?  I don't know anybody in
               Cucamonga.


     EXT. MAROON STUDIO - NIGHT

     The lot is dark and deserted.  Now headlights cut through the
     darkness as Maroon's Packard pulls up in front of the
     Administration building.


     INT. CAR - MAROON

     reaches over and opens the glove compartment.  He takes out a
     small automatic.  But his hands are so slippery with
     perspiration, it falls to the floor.  Cursing, he takes out
     a handkerchief, wipes his hands and his face and picks up the
     gun again.  As he gets out of the car, we see the clock says
     8:55.


     INT. ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - NIGHT

     Maroon hustles up to his office door.  He looks nervously
     over his shoulder, then goes inside.


     INT. MAROON'S OFFICE

     Maroon switches on the lights.  He goes to his desk.  He
     takes out the gun and puts it in the left hand drawer.  Then
     he takes it out and puts it in the right hand drawer.  Then
     back to the original drawer.  Finally satisfied, he goes to
     the bar to calm his obviously shattered nerves.  As his
     shakey hand starts to pour from the decanter, another hand
     comes INTO FRAME.

                               VALIANT
               Steady, R.K., that stuff's eighteen
               years old.

     Maroon jumps back as Valiant steps from behind the curtain,
     holding his black bag.

                               MAROON
               Valiant!  You surprised me.

                               VALIANT
               That was the idea.

     Valiant takes over the pouring duties.  He turns and carries
     Maroon's drink to him.  Maroon goes and sits down in his
     chair.  He looks to the pistol hiding place.  Valiant
     casually sits on the desk, putting his legs over the drawer.

                               VALIANT
               You're not too good at this, are you,
               R.K.?

                               MAROON
               No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker,
               not a murderer.

                               VALIANT
               Well, everybody needs a hobby.

                               MAROON
               No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I
               had nothin' to do with Acme gettin'
               killed.  I just wanted to sell my
               studio.  But they wouldn't buy my
               property unless Acme would sell his.
               And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna
               blackmail Acme with pictures of him and
               the rabbit's wife.

     Maroon gets up from his chair, highly agitated.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               But then it all went to hell.  I been
               around Toons all my life.  I can't sit
               around and see them all destroyed.

     Maroon eyes Valiant's black bag.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               You got the will in there, don't ya?

                               VALIANT
               No, I don't.

                               MAROON
               You tricked me, damn you!

                               VALIANT
               Take it easy.

                               MAROON
               There's no time to take it easy!  You
               don't realize the diabolical mind we're
               dealing with!


     ANGLE ON WINDOW

     A gun pokes through the open window past the curtain.  It's a
     Colt .45 Buntline -- an unmistakeable gun with an extra long
     barrel.

                               MAROON
               If I don't get that will by midnight
               tonight, Toontown's just gonna be land
               for the free...


     VALIANT

     sees a reflection of the gun on the glass on a movie poster
     on the wall.  He turns.  But it's too late.  BANG!  BANG!
     BANG!  Maroon crumples, caught mid-sentence.  Valiant dives
     behind the desk and draws his gun.  He looks over at Maroon's
     dead body on the floor.

                               VALIANT
               And the home of the brave?

     Valiant crawls to the window where the shots came from.  He
     looks out.


     VALIANT'S POV

     The comely silhouette of Jessica Rabbit runs to her car,
     jumps in and ROARS out the the studio gates.


     VALIANT

     grabs his black bag, climbs out of the office window and
     jumps off the fire escape to the lot below.


     EXT. STUDIO LOT

     Valiant hops into Maroon's Packard.  He hits the starter
     button and takes off after Jessica.


     NEW ANGLE

     as the car pulls away, the trunk lid lifts.  Roger Rabbit
     peers out, disoriented.  Then closes it.


     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     Jessica's car speeds along.  Valiant is in close pursuit in
     the Packard.  He's about to catch up on the straightaway when
     Jessica's car disappears into a tunnel.


     VALIANT

     slams on his brakes.  The Packard goes fishtailing, finally
     spinning to a stop at the foot of the "Toontown" sign.

     Valiant gets out of the car.  He looks down the tunnel.  He's
     sweating.  He loosens his necktie.  He paces back and forth
     at the tunnel mouth.  He looks up at the Toontown sign and
     suddenly smashes it with his fist.  It spins around like a
     weathervane.

     Valiant walks to the Packard with purpose.  He grabs the
     black bag and puts it on the hood.  He opens it and takes out
     the wooden box.


     CLOSE - BOX

     as the clasp is popped and the box opened, REVEAL a stunning
     presentation model TOON .38 resting on crushed velvet.  It's
     everything a real gun could be... and more.  Each feature is
     exaggerated... the barrel, the cylinder, the ivory grips are
     all Toon-sized.


     VALIANT

     picks the gun up and hefts it respectfully.  Then he opens an
     ammo section in the wooden box. SIX TOON .38 DUM-DUM BULLETS
     are in velvet creases.  The Toon Bullets blink to life as if
     awakening from a long sleep.

                               DUM-DUM #l
                      (rubbing eyes)
               Eddie... is that really you?

                               VALIANT
               Uh-huh.

                               DUM-DUM #2
               What year is it?

                               VALIANT
               '46.

                               DUM-DUM #3
               Who won the war?

                               DUM-DUM #4
               Who do you think, dummy?

                               DUM-DUM #5
               Welcome back, Eddie.

                               DUM-DUM #6
               Where you been the last five years?

                               VALIANT
               Drunk.

     He opens the cylinder.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Feelin' frisky tonight, boys?

                               DUM-DUMS
               Yeah!

     The Bullets eagerly dive into their respective chambers.  He
     snaps the cylinder closed, reaches into his shoulder holster
     and takes out the pint bottle.  He unscrews the cap and pours
     the rest of the booze onto the ground.  When it's drained, he
     flings the bottle in the air and FIRES the Toon .38.  KA-POW!
     It makes a SOUND like a CANNON.


     THE TOON BULLET

     climbs like a rocket into the dark sky.  It SCREECHES up to
     the bottle, puts on the brakes.  The Bullet puts on a
     jeweler's eyepiece, then it whips out a little hammer and
     chisel acd delivers one delicate tap.


     VALIANT

     watches as a cut glass chandelier falls out of the sky and
     CRASHES at his feet.  Valiant holsters his weapon and climbs
     into the Packard.  He puts it in gear and pulls into the
     tunnel.


     IN THE TUNNEL - DRIVING

     As Valiant heads toward the proverbial light at the end of
     the tunnel, suddenly the CAR RADIO COMES ON.

                               RADIO ANNOUNCER
               ... From the tippy tip top of
               Toontown's Tip Top Club, this is Mellow
               Melody Matinee.  Here's our favorite
               cricket, Jimmy, with 'Give A Little
               Whistle'.

                               JIMINY CRICKET
                      (on radio)
               'When you get in trouble, and you don't
               know right from wrong...'

     Valiant turns the on/off switch, then punches all the buttons
     but to no avail.  The SONG PLAYS ON anyway.

                               JIMINY CRICKET
                      (continuing)
               '... Give a little whistle
               Give a little whistle...'

                               VALIANT
               I hate Toontown...

     As Jimmy croons on, Valiant emerges from the tunnel.


     VALIANT'S FOV

     Through the windshield we see we have arrived in Toontown,
     where it's a beautiful sunny day.  Eddie is now driving down
     a phantasmagorical boulevard in a completely animated world.
     It's a Max Fleischer version of a city neighborhood.  The
     trees and buildings are swaying in time with the MUSIC.
     Eddie looks to his left and sees a huge Aphrodite-like hood
     ornament on the front of a TOON CAR.  Then as the car starts
     to pass him he sees hood... hood... hood... more hood then a
     CHAUFFEUR, then more car, and finally the Wolf we remember
     from the Ink & Paint Club.  He's in top hat and tails, a TOON
     LAMB in the passenger seat.  He tips his hat.

                               WOLF
               Helloooo, cousin.

     Now he drives past a Toon building under construction.  Like
     everything else in Toontown. the construction company sports
     the name "Acme".  The sign out frontsays:  WATCH OUR
     PROGRESS.  Eddie looks up, and before he can drive by, the
     building gets built floor by floor with accompanying SFX in
     about two seconds.

     Up ahead, the street is clear for blocks.  Then suddenly cars
     pour out of all side streets at once, clogging the boulevard
     like arteriosclerosis.  There is mad HONKING in this cartoon
     traffic jam.  Eddie shakes his head.  He pulls over, parks
     and gets out.

     Valiant pulls out his Toon .38.  Suddenly, the street empties
     in the blink of an eye.  Shutters close, and the sidewalk
     rolls up like window shades.  It's so quiet you could hear a
     pin drop.  In fact, a PIN DROPS from a second story window,
     landing with the CLANG! of a manhole cover.  All is quiet
     again.  Valiant starts across the street -- there is a CREAK
     behind him.  Valiant whirls around, levelling his pistol at
     the sound.


     ANGLE ON PACKARD - ROGER

     peeks out of the trunk of Maroon's car.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Don't shoot, Eddie.  It's me.

     Valiant lowers the gun as Roger emerges.

                               VALIANT
               What the hell are you doin' in there?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I followed you to the Maroon Studios.
               When I heard those shots, I thought I'd
               help you and investigate the inside of
               this trunk.

     Valiant reaches into the black bag in the car.  He comes out
     with a pair of TOON HANDCUFFS.  He slaps one on Roger's
     wrist.

                               ROGER RA13BIT
                      (continuing)
               Hey, what're you doin'?

     Valiant drags Roger to the steering wheel.

                               VALIANT
               I'm making sure you don't help me
               anymore.

     He locks the cuff to it, and heads across the street.


     AROUND THE CORNER - VALIANT

     stops at a street sign.  The post is bristling with fingers
     pointing in different directions; i.e., Poughkeepsie,
     Transylvania, Walla Walla, South Pole (the finger points down
     of course), and finally a finger which says:  The Dame.
     Eddie follows the finger down the side street to a high rise
     building.

     He catches a glimpse of Jessica darting into the elevators.
     Valiant hustles inside after her.

     Valiant goes to the elevators, and watches the floor
     indicator spinning round and Round, finally stopping with a
     BING at the 125th floor.  The elevator doors open and Valiant
     steps on.


     IN THE ELEVATOR

     Valiant punches 125.  Suddenly the elevator takes out with
     such velocity that Valiant is thrown to the floor.  After a
     moment, it stops so fast that he hits the ceiling.  Then
     bounces back to the floor as the doors open.  He picks
     himself up and steps off the elevator.

     He's in a foyer with four doors.  Valiant opens the first and
     steps inside.  He disappears.


     NEW ANGLE

     Valiant is on the outside of the building hanging onto a
     flagpole for dear life.  He looks down at the street which
     looks miles below.  Valiant inches back along the flagpole to
     the door and pulls himself to safety.


     INSIDE - VALIANT

     tries the next door.  This time more carefully.  A SPEEDING
     TRAIN is coming right at him.  He slams the door.  He tries
     the next one.  A homely OLD TOON LADY is in a bathtub.  She
     lets out a BLOODCURDLING SCREAM.  Valiant closes that door
     quickly, and turns to the last.  When he opens this one, we
     HEAR FOREBODING MUSIC.  We see...


     A DARK ALLEY

     Warily, Valiant walks into the alley, gun drawn.  There's a
     NOISE behind the garbage cans.  Valiant turns as a DEAD BODY
     with a knife in his back falls out of the shadows at
     Valiant's feet.  A SQUEAKY VOICE comes from behind Valiant.

                               VOICE
               I guess they didn't clean up after the
               last moider.

     Valiant whips around to see a TOON RAT perched on a skull
     picking his teeth.  Valiant kicks the skull.  The rat
     scrambles for cover.

     As Valiant continues on, we see...


     JESSICA RABBIT

     Steps out of the shadows behind him and aim the gun at his
     back.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Don't move, Valiant.

     Valiant turns slowly to see Jessica's got a bead on him with
     her revolver.

                               VALIANT
               Well... I always figured I'd get it in
               Toontown.

     BLAM!  She fires.  But Valiant's still standing.  We HEAR a
     CRASH behind Eddie as a figure falls into some boxes from a
     fire escape above.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               I think I got him.

     Jessica runs past Valiant to the figure.  He follows,
     bewildered.


     ANGLE ON GROUND

     We can see two rabbit ears sticking out from behind a box

                               VALIANT
               You shot Roger.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's
               men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.

     Jessica moves the box aside and tugs on the rabbit ears.  The
     rabbit head pops off.  Underneath is a Weasle.  In his hand
     is the Colt .45 Buntline.

                               VALIANT
               Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Don't worry, you're not the first.  We
               better get out of here.

     As they run down the alley...

                                              CUT TO:


     THE PACKARD - ROGER

     is behind the wheel making ENGINE NOISES like a little kid.
     He pushes all the buttons, windshield wipers, convertible
     top, etcetera, until he accidentally hits the starter button.
     VROOM!  The Packard fires to life.  Roger's startled for a
     moment, but quickly regains his composure.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hmmm... What would be the harm if I
               took her for a spin?

     He throws it into gear.  The Packard bucks into the car in
     front of it.  Then Roger shifts again.  The same process is
     repeated in reverse.  He SMASHES back and forth.  BANG!
     BANG!

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
                Ah... the open road.


     AROUND THE CORNER - EDDIE AND JESSICA

     come racing down the street.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?

                               VALIANT
               Why didn't you tell me?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               I didn't know who I could trust.

                               VALIANT
               We're even.  By the way, I did find
               your husband.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (excited)
               Where is he?

                               VALIANT
               He's right here in the...

     Valiant rounds the corner and points toward the spot where
     the car used to be.  But all that remains is a crumpled
     bumper.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               ... car.

     He shakes his head and looks around for signs of Roger.

                                              INTERCUT TO:


     THE PACKARD

     is careening down Toon streets totally out of control.
     Panicked, Roger is spinning the wheel as if it were a
     motorboat.  He drives in one side of Mother Goose's Shoe and
     out the other, diapers all over the windshield.  Unable to
     see, Roger steers right off the road.  The car hurtles
     through space.  As it starts to fall, we see it's Toon
     Monument Valley.  The Packard passes a promontory on which
     WILE E. COYOTE is perched.  As Roger passes, he waves to the
     Coyote.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hi, Roger Rabbit.  Love your work.

                                              INTERCUT TO:


     EDDIE AND JESSICA

     who are now facing a squad of TEN Toon Control Weasles.  They
     unleash a fusilade of bullets.

     Valiant knocks Jessica to the ground.  The bullets pass
     harmlessly overhead going into the window of the Acme Cheese
     Shop, riddling a round of cheese.  The CHEESEMAKER'S hand
     comes INTO FRAME changing the sign that says "Gouda" to
     "Swiss".

     Valiant rolls and FIRES his Toon .38 Special.  The Toon
     Bullet turns into a cannonball, which rolls down the street
     busting up the Weasle squad like a bowling ball through ten
     pins.

     As Eddie pulls Jessica to her feet, two more Weasles descend
     on them.  They fling Toon knives, which pin Eddie to a wooden
     fence.  Valiant rips one hand free, and BLASTS two shots at
     them.

     The Toon Bullets get to the Weasles, and open their nose
     cones.  Two frying pans emerge and BONK the Weasles on the
     head.

     Jessica starts to pull the knives out, releasing Eddie.

                               VALIANT
               How did you get onto Doom?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Marvin told me.  Doom was after his
               land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he
               brought me his will.

     Valiant sees a Weasle skulking at them with a tommygun.
     BLAM!  Valiant fires at him.  The Weasle ducks back around
     the corner.  But Valiant's Dum-Dum SCREECHES to a stop and
     goes around the corner, too.  We HEAR an EXPLOSION.  The
     Weasle come staggering out and falls in the street.

                               VALIANT
               So where is it?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               When I opened up the blue envelope, all
               that was inside was a blank piece of
               paper.

                               VALIANT
               A joker to the end.

     Now Weasles are coming at them from every direction.  Valiant
     aims the Toon .38 at a Toon tank rolling their way.  But when
     he pulls the trigger, the gun just CLICKS.  Empty.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Looks like our goose is cooked, our
               hash is slung, our fait is accompli...

                               VALIANT
               Lemme guess where you got that from.
               Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see
               in that guy anyway?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               He made me laugh.

     Valiant shakes his head.  Now they are completely surrounded
     by Weasles.  The situation looks bleak.

                               VALIANT
               Well, do you prefer to die this way or
               that way?

     Valiant jerks his thumb indicating the direction behind him.
     Suddenly, there's a rubber-burning SCREECH as Benny the
     Roadster arrives next to Valiant's hitchhiker-posed thumb.

                               ROADSTER
               Need a lift?

     Valiant does a take.

                               VALIANT
               Benny.

     The Roadster looks back approvingly as Jessica climbs in with
     Eddie.

                               ROADSTER
               Mr. Valiant, you've made a vast
               improvement in the company you keep.

     Benny blasts through a couple of Weasles.  They swing back
     and forth like tavern doors, then topple.

     He takes a hard right into the next block which is the Toon
     Arctic.  His tires turn into skis.  He slaloms back and forth
     between trees.  The Weasles pursue on dogsled.

     Benny grabs a striped barber's pole -- the North Pole -- and
     slides down it.  They land in the Toon Sahara.  Benny crawls
     up a large sand dune, his tongue hanging out of his radiator.
     He glances back at the Weasles who are mounted on camels,
     waving scimitars.  When they reach the top of the sand dune,
     we see they're on the precipice of a bottomless chasm.

                               ROADSTER
               Look, the drawbridge -- we're gonna
               make it.

                               VALIANT
               I don't see any bridge.

                               ROADSTER
               That's because you gotta draw it first.

     Benny takes a pencil hanging from a post lettered "Draw
     Bridge".  He wets the pencil point and in a flash draws a
     bridge.  It's a rickety rope bridge.  Using the pencil as a
     balancing pole, Benny starts to tiptoe across.

     The Weasles jump off t'heir camels and start filing onto the
     bridge after them.

     When Benny finally reaches the other side, Valiant grabs the
     pencil from him and gets out of the car.

                               VALIANT
               Hold on a second.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Eddie, come on.

     But Valiant stands facing the Weasles, who are charging at
     him, swords raised.  With a sly smile, Valiant holds up the
     eraser end of the pencil.  This freezes the Weasles.  But as
     Valiant starts to erase a rope support, the eraser breaks off
     the pencil and falls down into the chasm.  The Weasles WHEEZE
     with relief and advance for the kill.  At the last second,
     Valiant takes the business end of the pencil and scribbles a
     handsaw.  He grabs it by the handle and saws the rope.  The
     bridge swings away, smacking the Weasles into the opposite
     canyon wall.  One by one, they slide off and disappear into
     the abyss.


     VALIANT

     climbs back into Benny.  The Roadster takes off again, making
     a skidding left turn onto the main drag.  As they make their
     break into the Toontown tunnel...


     EXT. TOONTOWN TUNNEL - L.A. SIDE - NIGHT

     A ten gallon drum is sitting by the side of the road under
     the Toontown sign.  From in the tunnel we hear the SOUND of
     Benny's ENGINE coming closer.  Now a foot comes out of the
     shadows and rests on the ten gallon drum.  As the SOUND of
     the ROADSTER gets VERY LOUD, the foot kicks the drum over,
     spilling a clear liquid across the road.


     NEW ANGLE - THE FOOT

     belongs to Judge Doom.  Doom smiles sadistically as the
     Roadster with Eddie and Jessica aboard comes shooting out of
     the tunnel.  When Benny hits the liquid, he starts to skid.

                               ROADSTER
               Uh-oh... whoaaa...!  Look out!

     His tires smoke, then disappear. It's a dip slick.  Without
     tires, Benny spins out of control, finally ending up in the
     bushes roadside.

     Before Eddie and Jessica can make a move, they are surrounded
     by a horde of Weasles pointing what looks like a hundred guns
     at them.

                               DOOM
               Are you two all right?

     Doom opens one of the Roadster's doors and helps Jessica out.
     Valiant climbs out after her.  The Weasles quickly relieve
     him of his Toon pistol.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               These roads can be very treacherous at
               night, especially in a maniacal Toon
               vehicle.

                               VALIANT
               The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.

                               DOOM
               I've had enough of your insolence!
                      (to Weasles)
               Put him in my car.  I think they'll
               enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at
               the Acme factory.

     The Weasles prod Valiant and Jessica into Doom's Lincoln.  A
     Weasle refers to Benny WHIMPERING in the bushes.

                               WEASLE
               What about him?

                               DOOM
               He's not going anywhere.  We'll send
               the mobile unit after him.

     Doom climbs into the car and it zooms off, Weasles jumping
     onto the running boards.


     BENNY

     crawls out of the bushes on his axles.

                               ROADSTER
               The boinin', the boinin'...

     He makes it down into the drainage ditch, dipping his
     tootsies one by one.  There's a HISS as they hit the water
     and the chemicals from the dip are extinguished.

                               ROADSTER
                      (continuing)
               Oh, yeah... that's better.

     Now Benny hears the SOUND of another VEHICLE COMING out of
     the Toontown Tunnel.  He ducks down and peeks over the ditch
     to see...


     ROGER IN THE PACKARD

     come SCREAMING out of the tunnel backwards.  Maroon's Packard
     looks like the winner of a demolition derby.

     Benny stands and waves to him.

                               ROADSTER
               Roger!

     Roger sees him and slams on the brakes, skidding the Packard
     into the Toontown sign.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Benny?

     Benny hobbles over to the Packard.  He pops his trunk and
     rummages around.  He comes out with Toon boltcutters.  He
     clips Roger's cuffs off.

                               ROADSTER
               Doom's got your wife and Valiant.  He
               took them to the Acme factory,

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Let's go!

     Benny nudges Roger to the passenger side.

                               ROADSTER
               Slide over, son.  It looks like you've
               done enough drivin' for tonight.

     Now the Toon Roadster gingerly gets behind the wheel of the
     Packard.  He hits the gas and the Packard lurches down the
     road.


     INT. ACME FACTORY - NIGHT

     Doom's car is parked inside.  There are several other
     vehicles as well.  There's a steamroller, a road grader, and
     a huge modified tanker truck.  It's mounted with a thousand
     gallon vat, the contents of which are being stirred by a
     motorized unit.  All the vehicles are marked with a large
     green four-leaf clover logo.


     VALIANT AND JESSICA

     are held at gunpoint by a couple of Weasles, while several
     others are busy JACKHAMMERING the brick wall at the far end
     of the factory.  Doom pulls on his rubber gloves, turns to
     the Weasles.

                               DOOM
               Frisk them.  See if they have the will.

     Several Weasles rush for the opportunity to frisk Jessica.
     The head Weasle slaps the others away.  Then WHEEZING
     laciviously, he turns to the task.  He starts to move his
     hands over her body when Jessica stomps her heel on his feet.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Get your hands off me, you little
               rodent!

     The Weasle hops away angrily and quickly frisks Valiant.  He
     turns to Doom and shakes his head.

                               DOOM
               No matter.
                      (checks watch)
               I don't expect the will to show up in
               the next fifteen minutes.  By then
               Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite
               legally.

                               VALIANT
               So you're Cloverleaf?

                               DOOM
               No one person is Cloverleaf.  We're a
               vast company with diverse interests...
               gasoline, tires, automobiles.


     AT THE BRICK WALL

     The jackhammering has stopped.  A Weasle plucks one brick out
     of the wall.  Toon light beams through.  He reaches into the
     hole in the wall and comes out holding a bunch of Toon
     bananas.  WHEEZING wickedly, he passes them out to his
     compatriots.  They devour the bananas, throwing the peels
     helter-skelter.


     VALIANT

     turns his attention from the brick wall back to Doom.

                               VALIANT
               Come on, Doom.  What would a company
               like that want with Toontown?

                               DOOM
               It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was
               my idea of how to put the land to
               better use.

     Doom goes to the truck and starts turning on valves and
     starting compressors.
                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               In fact, they thought my concept so
               brilliant, that they offered me the
               Directorship of Transportation.  I've
               accepted.
                      (to Weasle)
               Bring me Mr. Valiant's gun.

     The Weasle trots over and delivers Valiant's Toon .38.  Doom
     inspects it.  He reads an engraving on the frame.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               'Thanks for getting me out of the
               hoosegow.  Yosemite Sam'.
                      (looks up)
               How sweet.

     Doom throws the gun on the ground.  He pushes back a long
     lever on the truck, letting loose a tiny spurt of fluid from
     the discharge valve.  The gun disappears.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Dip?

                               DOOM
               That's right.  Enough to dip Toontown
               off the face of the earth.


     EXT. ACME FACTORY - ROGER AND BENNY

     have been watching the proceedings through a window.  They
     turn to each other stunned.

                               BENNY/ROGER RABBIT
               Dip Toontown?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               We gotta do something!

     Roger scurries back to the Packard hidden outside the gates.
     He opens Valiant's black bag and comes out holding Eddie's
     real pistol.  Benny comes tenderfooting up.

                               ROADSTER
               Roger, what're you gonna do with that
               gun?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I'm gonna save them, of course.  You go
               for help.  Find Dolores at the Terminal
               Bar.  She'll know what to do.

                               ROADSTER
               Well... all right...

     Reluctantly, Benny gets behind the wheel of the Packard.

                               ROADSTER
                      (continuing)
               But you be careful now with that gun.
               This ain't no cartoon.

     Benny pulls away.  Roger turns with determination and zips
     back to the window


     INT. FACTORY

     Doom pulls the tarp off the top of the truck, revealing a
     modified water cannon.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               You're sick, Doom.  Where do people
               like you come from?

                               DOOM
               Never mind where I come from.  Just
               watch where I'm going.

                               VALIANT
               Don't you think anyone's gonna notice
               that Toontown's gone?

                               DOOM
               They won't care.  Who's going to miss
               some ridiculous talking mice when they
               can have the future?


     EXT. BACK OF FACTORY - ROGER

     is trying to jimmy open a window using his whole body for
     leverage.  He finally pops the window open.  Gun drawn, he
     climbs over the sill.  And falls head first.


     INT. BATHROOM

     Roger splashes into the toilet bowl in the Acme washroom.  He
     bobs up.  He drains the water out of the pistol barrel and
     peeks over the bowl.  He gets a determined look in his eye.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               It's time to make my move.

     Roger starts to climb out of the toilet.  He reaches for
     something to grab onto.  Unwittingly, he gets the toilet
     chain hanging from the tank above.  As he pulls himself out,
     the toilet flushes.   Roger has only a moment to register a
     dumbfounded expression before he is sucked down the john.


     IN THE FACTORY - DOOM

     continues expansively.

                               DOOM
               Right here where we're standing, will
               be the cornerstone of my idea... the
               cloverleaf -- an elegant cement
               structure that intertwines freeways.

                               VALIANT
               What the hell's a freeway?

                               DOOM
               A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes
               of asphalt running uninterrupted from
               L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to
               Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica.
               Someday everyone will be in cars
               driving happily, non-stop from one end
               of the L.A. Basin to another.

                               VALIANT
               That's what this is all about?  Tell
               me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway?
               We got the Red Cars, the best public
               transportation in the country.

                               DOOM
               Not for long.  We're retiring the Red
               Cars.  People will drive, Mr. Valiant,
               because they'll have to.  And when they
               drive, they'll have to buy our cars,
               our tires, our gasoline.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Why'd you bother to call it a freeway?

     Doom steps up into their faces.  Behind him, several Weasles
     are fashioning a noose.

                               DOOM
               Has a nice ring.  Too bad you two won't
               be around to enjoy it.

     Suddenly Roger EXPLODES out of the drainage grate in the
     floor.  His entrance sends the Weasles flying.  Roger lands
     on his feet, James Cagney-like, levelling his gun on Judge
     Doom.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Get 'em up.  All of you!  Or I let the
               Judge have it!

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Roger, darling!

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yes, it's me, my dearest.  I'd embrace
               you but first I have to take care of
               some unfinished business.

                               DOOM
               Put that gun down, you buck-toothed
               fool.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Go ahead.  Give me an excuse to fill
               you full of holes, pump you full of
               lead.
                      (over shoulder)
               How'm I doin', Eddie?

                               VALIANT
               Real good, Rog... but maybe you better
               let me take over.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Not before I satisfy my sense of moral
               outrage.

     Milking the moment, he shifts the gun from one hand to
     another.  He circles Doom, poking and prodding him with the
     gun.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               You think you could get away with this?
               Hah!  We Toons may be idiotic, but
               we're not stupid!


     POV OVERHEAD

     We LOOK DOWN on the proceedings from high in the rafters.
     PULL BACK TO REVEAL we're watching from the POV of Voltaire,
     who's perched on the top inventory rack.  Voltaire cleans his
     fingernails, casually.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yes, justice, Judge Doom.  The real
               meaning of the word probably hits you
               like a ton of bricks!

     Voltaire calmly nudges an Acme Ton-Of-Bricks off the shelf.


     CLOSE - ROGER

     He never sees it coming.  SMASH!  The bricks land on his head
     and bury him.  The only thing we can see of Roger is his hand
     with the gun in it.

                               DOOM
               Well, this is turning out better than
               I thought.

     Doom picks the gun up.  The Weasles drag Roger out from under
     the bricks.  Big bright stars are circling his head.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (delirious)
               Look, stars!  Ready when you are,
               Raoul.

     Valiant shakes his head, but Jessica starts to laugh.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               I have missed you, Roger.

                               DOOM
               Tie the lovebirds together.

     The Weasles twirl Toon rope around Roger and Jessica like a
     cocoon.  They hook them on a power winch.  Then hit a button
     and raise Roger and Jessica until they're suspended fifteen
     feet above the floor... right in the path of the Dipmobile.

     Doom hands Valiant's gun to the head Weasle.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Let him watch his Toon friends get
               dipped...  then shoot him.

     Doom turns and starts to walk away.


     ANGLE ON GROUND

     He steps on a Toon banana peel and goes flat on his keester.


     THE WEASLES

     always quick with a laugh, BREAK UP at their boss'
     misfortune.  The one guarding Eddie is so overcome with
     LAUGHTER that he's slapping his thigh with his gun hand.
     Valiant sees his opportunity.  He starts to make a move
     toward the distracted Weasle and almost gets his hands on the
     gun when:

                               DOOM
               Watch out, you idiot... he's going for
               the gun!

     The Weasle turns at the last second, sticking the barrel up
     against Valiant's nose.  Doom gets to his feet.  He glowers
     at the Weasle and knocks him on the head with the gavel head
     of his cane.  Doom stalks out of the room.

     The Weasles scramble to positions on the Dipmobile.  One
     FIRES UP the ENGINE.

     The streetcleaner brushes start to turn.  The vehicle starts
     to creep forward.

     Another Weasle climbs into the turret.  He puts Roger and
     Jessica in the crosshairs of the cannon.

     Beads of sweat break out on Valiant's face.

     The Weasle, WHEEZING with evil glee, starts to press his
     finger to the trigger.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               You guys think this is real funny,
               doncha?
                      (to Valiant)
               Eddie, do somethin'!

     At the last second, Eddie shouts at the Weasle.

                               VALIANT
               Hey!

     The Weasle turns to him.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Before you pull the trigger, I want you
               to know somethin' about the guy you're
               about to dip.

     Suddenly, Eddie breaks into the "Looney Tooney Song".  The
     song Roger had sung in the bar.  The silly voice that comes
     out of his mouth surprises everybody, especially Roger.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing;
                       sings)
               'His name is Roger Rabbit
               He's got a crazy habit...'

     Valiant starts skulking across the floor.  It's a cross
     between Groucho Marx and a Chuck Berry Duck Walk.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing;
                       sings)
               'He likes to sing and dance and yuk
               So brighten up and smile you
                  schmuck...'

     Valiant starts "hoo-hooing", slapping himself in the
     forehead.  Now the Weasles start GIGGLING.  They've never
     seen a human do this before.

                               VALIANT
               'Now my name's Eddie V
               I'm looney too you'll see'

     Valiant flips into a handstand and starts walking on his
     hands.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               'I walk with my hands
               And I shake with my feet...'

     He offers his foot to a Weasle who shakes it.  The others
     HOWL.  Eddie flips upright and grabs a stick of Acme
     dynamite.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               'I think dynamite
               Is swell to eat'.

     Eddie takes a bite out of the Toon dynamite and acts like
     he's savoring it.  The spectacle of this human doing this is
     too much to bear.  Now the Weasles are rolling on the ground,
     holding their sides.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               He's lost his mind!

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yeah, isn't it great?  Keep it up,
               Eddie... you're killing 'em, you're
               slayin' 'em, you're knockin' 'em dead.

     Roger means it.  The Weasles are laughing so hard they're
     giving themselves heart attacks.  Valiant spins around on the
     floor like a clock dial gone berserk.

                               VALIANT
               Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo...

     One by one, the Weasles keel over... dead.  Opaque WEASLE
     SPIRITS leave their bodies with wings and harps, and float
     heavenward, still laughing.


     VOLTAIRE

     alarmed at the scene below, grabs a brick and flaps toward
     the ceiling.  He throws the brick through the skylight and
     flies out.

                               VOLTAIRE
               Doom!  Doom!


     ON THE DIPMOBILE

     The Weasle on the turret collapses onto the trigger.  The
     unmanned dip cannon starts spraying, as the arm sweeps
     slowly back and forth like an, automatic lawn sprinkler.


     VALIANT

     hitches a ride on the last ascending Weasle Spirit, letting
     it hoist him to the top of the truck.  As he moves the Weasle
     body off the trigger...


     VOLTAIRE

     CRASHES back through the skylight and swoops down on Eddie.
     He sinks his talons into Eddie's back and lifts him into the
     air.

     As Valiant is being pulled skyward he reaches for something
     along the wall of inventory.  He grabs a handful of Acme
     Small Pills and jams a couple dowm the buzzard's mouth.
     Instantly, Voltaire starts to shrink.  As he gets smaller, he
     can no longer hold Eddie up.  They both descend as Voltaire
     shrinks to the size of a chick.

     The sprayer is swinging back towards Roger and Jessica.  At
     the last second, Valiant reaches up and blocks it.  It swings
     back the other way.

     As Valiant scrambles up on the vehicle to turn it off,
     Voltaire has found a box of Acme Big Pills.  He pecks into
     it... and after a beat, EXPLODES out of the box.  He's now
     three times the size he was before.  Voltaire flaps in for
     the kill.

     Valiant reaches the turret just in time to swing the cannon
     around.  The spray of dip blasts one of Voltaire's wings off.
     He spins earthward like a flaming Messerschmidt, finally
     landing in the dip vat and dissolving into a black pool.

     Doom arrives just in time to see his pet bird dissolved.
     Angrily, he steps onto a giant Acme Mousetrap.  He uses a
     piece of Acme cheese to spring it, catapulting him through
     the air.

     Just as Valiant is about to turn off the dip cannon, Doom
     lands on the truck.  He knocks Eddie off the turret with a
     flying tackle.  They both hit the floor.

     Doom gets up, leaving Eddie stunned.  He sprints to where the
     Weasle had dropped Eddie's pistol.  Finally Eddie shakes it
     off.  He sees Doom about to reach the gun.  He straps on a
     pair of Acme Rocket Skates, fires them up and shoots across
     the floor.  He knocks Doom into a stack of Acme boxes,
     toppling the whole shelf down on top of him.

     As the sprayer swings back toward Roger and Jessica, they
     have their last moment together.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Roger, I want you to know I love you.
               I loved you more than any woman has
               ever loved a rabbit.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Be comforted in the knowledge that as
               we face the Grim Dipper, our paint will
               be comingled for eternity.

     They both close their eyes, waiting for the end.  But it
     never cames.  The truck runs up on some boxes and the sprayer
     arm swings back the other way.

     Doom grabs an Acme slingshot, loads an Acme boulder and fires
     it at Valiant.  BLAM!  It whacks Valiant on the head, laying
     him out cold in front of the Cloverleaf steamroller,

     Doom climbs into the steamroller and starts it up.  He puts
     it into gear and starts it rolling toward Valiant.

     Valiant comes around to see the huge roller bearing down on
     him.  At the last second, Valiant rolls out of the way and
     grabs an Acme boxing glove.  It accordians out and smashes
     Doom in the face.  He goes flying out of the driver's seat,
     turning the wheel as he falls.  The steamroller starts to
     turn in circles.

     Valiant jumps Doom.  But Doom is stronger.  He throws Valiant
     off and starts whacking him with his fist.  He pummels
     Valiant backward toward the drum of the steamroller.  Valiant
     grabs the nearest thing for defense.  It's a can of Acme
     Stay-Put Adhesive.  He whips it up in front of his face.
     Doom puts his fist right through it, covering his hand with
     glue.  He smiles at Valiant and hauls off again.  Valiant
     ducks.  Doom's fist strikes the top of the drum of the
     steamroller.  Frantically he tries to pull it off.  But it
     "Stays-Put".  The roller starts to suck his fist down and
     under.

                               DOOM
               Nooooo!

     Jessica and Roger avert their eyes as the steamroller crushes
     Doom.

     Valiant breathes a sigh of relief.  He starts for the dip
     truck as the cannon swings back toward Roger and Jessica.
     But neither of them are watching the cannon.  Their eyes are
     fixed on the ground behind the steamroller.


     ANGLE ON GROUND

     There isn't the messy pile of blood and guts you'd expect to
     see if a human got run over.  Instead, we see that Judge
     Doom's remains have rolled out like a flat black pancake.
     After a beat, an edge curls up with a CREAK.  Now the whole
     shape peels off the floor and wobbles to it's feet. REVEALING
     DOOM IS A TOON.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Eddie, look out!


     VALIANT

     turns to see Doom stick his flattened thumb in his mouth.  He
     blows, re-inflating himself.  His glasses CRACK and fall off.
     Then his prosthetic eyeballs pop out.  His teeth shatter and
     fall out of his mouth like china.  Underneath his latex mask
     we can see his Toon mouth and evil red Toon eyes.

                               VALIANT
               Holy shit, he's a Toon!

                               DOOM
               Surprised?

                               VALIANT
               Not really.  Only a Toon could think of
               something as goofy as that freeway
               idea.

     Doom takes the black rubber gloves off, REVEALING red hands
     with long fingernails.  He makes his fist into an anvil and
     advances on Valiant.

                               DOOM
               Is that so?  Well, we'll see who's the
               goofy one.

     BLAM!  From ten feet away, he smashes Valiant with a
     bone-crushing punch.  Valiant staggers backwards.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               By the way, when I killed your brother,
               Teddy, I used to talk just like this.

     Doom spesks in a Toony high-pitched squeak.  Valiant
     recognizes him now.

                               VALIANT
               You?

                               DOOM
               That's right, me.

     BLAM!  Doom hammers Valiant again.  He's defenseless against
     Doom's super human strength.  BLAM!  Valiant goes
     sprawling to the ground.  Now Doom's hand turns into a
     buzzsaw.  He goes to administer the coup de grace.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Now Eddie's gonna be deady, just like
               Teddy.

     With his last ounce of strength, Valiant grabs the Acme
     Boxing Glove.  He pops it.  The glove extends across the
     room, punching the release lever on the dip truck.


     CLOSE - VALVE

     A flood of dip gushes out of the valve and rolls toward Doom
     like a wave.


     DOOM

     SCREAMS as the torrent hits him with a CRASH.  But there's no
     escape for him this time.  The flood of liquid envelopes him
     at the ankles.  He dissolves into it like a melting candle.


     THE DIPMOBILE

     continues forward inexorably.  The arm is swinging towards
     Roger and Jessica.  It gets closer and closer...

     Valiant tries to get to the truck, but it's too late.  The
     cannon has reached them.


     CLOSE - ROGER AND JESSICA

     They close their eyes, preparing to meet their Maker.  But
     nothing happens.

     The spray of the cannon suddenly peters out.  It dries up in
     a harmless drip as the tank has completely emptied.

     Valiant gets to the controls of the power winch.  He hoists
     Roger and Jessica up out of the way.  The Dipmobile passes
     harmlessly underneath them and SMASHES through the brick
     wall.


     TOONTOWN

     is REVEALED in all its splendor.  It's a bucolic setting.  A
     rainbow shares the blue sky with a smiling sun.  Fawns and
     butterflies, chipmunks and flowers watch curiously as the dip
     truck rolls past.  Suddenly it's lifted off the ground.  We
     see it's resting on the top of a TOON GIANT's head.  This
     Giant plucks the truck off his head, regards it, then pops it
     in his mouth.


     VALIANT

     lowers Roger and Jessica to the ground.  We HEAR POLICE
     SIRENS approach.  When Valiant unties them, Jessica turns and
     exclaims...

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               My hero!

     Then she hugs Roger passionately.  Valiant can only shrug.


     THROUGH THE WALL - TOONS

     start coming in.  They look around at the scene, bewildered,
     then gather around Doom's robe, mask and shoes lying in the
     puddle of dip.  There's a reddish slick floating on top.
     Valiant wanders over and joins them.

                               VALIANT
               Hi-ho, the Doom is dead.


     ANGLE ON DOOR

     Dolores, Lt. Santino, and several other COPS rush in, guns
     drawn.  Dolores runs to Eddie and puts her arms around him.
     Santino looks down at the remains on the floor.

                               LT. SANTINO
               What the hell is that?

                               VALIANT
               Doom.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Jesus Christ... that was the Judge?

     Valiant takes the paint chip out of his pocket.  He puts it
     up against the red slime on the robe.  It's a match.

                               VALIANT
               That was the murderer of Herman Acme,
               Maroon... and my brother.

     Dolores looks down at the front of Valiant's shirt.  A dark
     stain is appearing.

                               DOLORES
               Eddie, we better get you to hospital.
               You're bleedin'.

     Valiant looks down at the stain.

                               VALIANT
               That's not blood.  That's ink.  That
               goof Acme squirted me with some the
               other day.  Why it's comin' 'through
               now, I don't know.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               That's because it's
               Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up
               three days later.  Gives you enough
               time to get away from the victim so he
               doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great
               gag.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah...

                               DOLORES
               I'll treat you to a new shirt.  After
               all, you did save Toontown.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Problem is without Marvin's will, the
               land still goes to Cloverleaf.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               That's right.  If only we knew what
               happened to that will...

     Valiant looks up from his shirt.

                               VALIANT
               Say Roger, remember that love letter
               you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint
               Club?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yeah?

                               VALIANT
               I think you oughta read it to her.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Good idea.

     He reaches in his pocket, pulls out the paper and clears his
     throat.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing;
                       reads)
               Dear Jessy... How do I love thee?  Let
               me count the... I, Marvin Acme, of
               sound mind and body... Hey?


     CLOSE - PAPER

     The Disappearing-Reappearing Ink is coming up over Roger's
     scribbling.

                               VALIANT
               Keep reading...

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (reads)
               Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of
               sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo,
               do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the
               property known as Toontown to those
               loveable characters...

     PAN the Toon crowd, who are listening to the reading of the
     will.  It is a gallery of recognizable faces.  Everyone from
     Mickey to Bugs, Yakky Doodle to Yosemite Sam, Dumbo to Dopey,
     Bambi to Droopy, Tweety Bird to Tinkerbell.  They're all
     there.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               ... who have given me and the rest of
               humanity so much mirth and merriment...
               the Toons.

     The Toon crowd erupts with a CHEER!  Hats go in the air and
     they descend on Roger, slapping his back.  Roger breaks away
     from the crowd and joins Eddie.


     TWO SHOT - EDDIE AND ROGER

     They stand side by side, looking out over Toontown.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, Eddie, you still think I'm a
               patsy, a simp, a chump?

     Eddie wipes the spit off his face.

                               VALIANT
               No, kid, you're a real hero.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I guess I am at that.  Cigar?

     Roger holds out a large stogie.

                               VALIANT
               Why not?

     Roger lights Eddie's and one for himself.

                               VALIANT
                       (continuing)
               By the way, Roger, you were right about
               your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm
               glad you got her back.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               And I'm glad you got your sense of
               humor back.  Think you'll keep it?

                               VALIANT
               Only time will tell.

     Valiant puffs on the cigar.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               From this box here...

     Valiant glances down.  The box says, "Acme Exploding Cigars".
     He looks to Roger, but it's too late.  KABOOM!  KABOOM!
     Their cigars blow up in classic Toon tradition, blackening
     both their faces.  Roger starts laughing.  Eddie stares at
     Roger for a moment, then he starts laughing too.  They throw
     their heads back in a HOWL.  The other Toons join in.  Pretty
     soon the whole factory is shaking with LAUGHTER.


     A TOON COP

     dressed in blue uniform and hat with his back to us tries to
     restore order in the Acme factory.  As soon as he talks, we
     recognize the stutter.  It's PORKY PIG.

                               PORKY PIG
               O-k-k-k, mmmove along.  There's
               nnnothin' else to see.  T-t-that's it.
               T-t-that's all, folks.
                      (turns to
                       CAMERA)
               Hmm, I l-l-like the sound of that.

     Then, savoring the phrase, Porky stutters out the famous
     sign-off.

                               PORKY PIG
                      (continuing)
                Eee-ba-da, eee-ba-da... t-t-that's all,
                folks!

     CARTOON MUSIC UP.

                        WHO SHOT ROGER RABBIT?

     This movie starts the way all movies should... with a
     cartoon.  It's not a Disney or a Warner's.  It's not a
     Fleischer, an MGM, or a Lanz.  This is a lesser known
     studio.


     FADE IN:

     ON A "MAROON CARTOON"

     Accompanied by zany CARTOON MUSIC, the TITLE CARD reads:

                   MAROON CARTOONS PRESENT
                BABY HERMAN AND ROGER RABBIT
                           IN
                      "THE BUNNYSITTER"

     Below are two cameos of the cartoon's stars.  One picture is
     of a cherubic baby in a bonnet innocently posed with his
     thumb in his mouth.  The other is of a paunchy rabbit with a
     gap between his front teeth.  He has a loveable, if slightly
     shell-shocked look.  The cartoon begins...


     BABY HERMAN AND ROGER RABBIT

     are in a playpen when TWO FEMALE LEGS in high heels walk INTO
     FRAME.  The VOICE belonging to the legs talks down to Baby
     Herman in a maternal coo.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
               Mommy's going to the beauty parlor,
               darling.  But I'm leaving you with your
               favorite friend, Roger.  He's going to
               take very, very good care of you...
                      (voice turns
                       ominous)
               ... cause if he doesn't, he's going
               back to the science lab!

     Roger gulps as he watches the legs disappear.  We HEAR
     FOOTSTEPS recede and a DOOR SLAM.  Roger turns confidently
     back to his charge.  But the little tyke is already squeezing
     through the playpen bars.

                               BABY HERMAN
               Baby bye-bye...

     Roger makes a dive for him, misses, and gets his head stuck
     between the bars.  He pleads with the Baby in a voice that
     resonates of Huntz Hall in "The Bowery Boys".

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hey, come back!  You heard what your
               mother said!


     BABY HERMAN

     ignores Roger.  We FOLLOW HIM as he crawls into the kitchen.
     He stops to regard something that has caught his attention...
     a cookie jar.  It's sitting on top of the refrigerator.

                               BABY HERMAN
               Coo-kie.


     ROGER

     wearing the playpen like a pillory, comes running toward the
     kitchen.  But the playpen is too wide to clear the door.  The
     impact SHATTERING the playpen and sends Roger sprawling
     across the kitchen floor.  When he looks up...


     BABY HERMAN

     is swinging precariously on the door of the freeer.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hang on, Baby.  I'll save you!

     Roger makes a desperate leap across the kitchen for the kid.
     But Baby Herman swings the door to the freezer open and Roger
     disappears inside.  Baby Herman grabs a cookie and swings
     back, shutting the door.  He climbs down and crawls out of
     the kitchen.  After a beat, the freezer door opens.


     ROGER

     now shaped like a block of ice, falls out and hits the floor.
     The block SHATTERS into ice cubes.  Roger looks around,
     dazed.


     BABY HERMAN

     has taken this opportunity to crawl out the window.  Roger
     races to the window.  His eyes pop out of his head at what he
     sees.


     ROGER'S POV

     Baby Herman is crawling along the sidewalk under the shadow
     of a safe being hoisted into a second floor window by the
     Acme Safe Moving Company.  The rope holding the safe is
     fraying down to a slender thread.


     ROGER

     gasps and rockets out the window toward Baby Herman.  The
     rope snaps.  The safe falls.  Roger arrives just in time to
     pluck the Baby out of harm's way.  But not in time to save
     himself.  The safe CRUNCHES down on his head, burying Roger
     into the sidewalk.  After a beat, Roger's hand appears and
     spins the tumbler.  The safe door opens.  Inside, we see the
     dazed rabbit with little TWEETING BIRDS circling his head.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
               Cut, cut, cut!

     The cartoon action stops abruptly, but the goofy CARTOON
     MUSIC PLAYS ON.  We begin a slow PULL BACK TO REVEAL that
     this cartoon is being filmed LIVE ON A SOUND STAGE.  The
     title card sits on an easle.  The female legs are paper
     mache' props manipulated by two HUMAN CREW MEMBERS.  Wearily,
     they lean the legs up against the stage wall.  A human
     DIRECTOR, wearing a tweed jacket and baggy pleated pants,
     steps onto the set.  From the equipment and the dress of the
     crew, we can tell it's the 1940's.  Baby Herman throws his
     cookie down in disgust.  He talks in a gravelly voice an
     octave lower than Wallace Beery's.

                               BABY HERMAN
               What the hell was wrong with that
               take??

                               DIRECTOR
               Nothin' with you, Baby Herman.  It's on
               Roger... again!
                      (over shoulder)
               Hey!  Could we lose the playback?

     The MUSIC suddenly STOPS as, off to the side, the SOUNDMAN
     lifts the needle off a phonograph record.  The Director leans
     over Roger and angrily plucks one of the birds circling his
     head.

                               DIRECTOR
                      (continuing)
               What's this, Roger?

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (sheepish)
               A tweeting bird?

                               DIRECTOR
               That's right, a tweeting bird.  But
               what does the script say?  'Rabbit gets
               conked.  Rabbit sees stars!'  Not
               birds, stars!

                               BABY HERMAN
               Aw, for cryin' out loud, Roger!  I'll
               be in my trailer... takin' a nap!

     Baby Herman pulls himself up to his full height of two feet
     and walks off the set.  He chooses a route that takes him
     under the dress of the SCRIPT GIRL.  She jumps as if goosed.
     Now two CREW MEMBERS lift the safe off Roger.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars,
               I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my
               head one more time.

                               DIRECTOR
               I've already dropped it on you
               twenty-three times.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Don't worry about me.  I can take it.

                               DIRECTOR
               I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried
               about the safe.

     CONTINUED PULLBACK.

     What we've been seeing has been from the POV of a MAN in a
     shiny brown suit standing unobtrusively at the back of the
     sound stage.  Under a beat-up fedora is a craggy face that's
     seen a lot in its life... but apparently didn't think much of
     it was funny.  EDDIE VALIANT takes a jolt from a pint of
     whiskey, evidently in reaction to what he's seen.  He opens
     his coat and returns the pint bottle to a shoulder holster
     which had formerly held a .38.  Nerves steadied, he walks out
     the stage door.


     EXT. MAROON STUDIO - DAY

     Valiant emerges from the stage onto a bustling Hollywood
     studio lot where CARTOON CHARACTERS (TOONS) and humans are
     comingling as if it were the most natural thing in the world.
     Valiant stops by an Acme Novelty truck which is unloading
     Toon props.  There are bombs, rockets, flattened pocket
     watches, anvils, giant slingshots, etcetera.  The license
     plate is California 1946.  He fishes out a pack of
     Chesterfields and taps out a half a butt that had been
     stubbed out.  As he lights it, Valiant regards a chubby,
     balding man wearing a three-piece suit and a worried
     expression coming towards him.  He is R.K. MAROON, studio
     boss.  Maroon is leading an entourage of ASSISTANTS trying to
     keep up.

                               MAROON
               Starting tomorrow there'll be no more
               roast beef lunches.  What happened to
               cheese sandwiches?  I was raised on
               cheese sandwiches.

     As the Assistants dutifully record his thoughts, Maroon sees
     a GUY taking a nap in the shade of a palm tree.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               And tell that guy sleepin' over there
               he's fired!
 
                               ASSISTANT
               It's your wife's brother, R.K.

                               MAROON
                      (reconsiders)
               Oh... tell him he's promoted.  But get
               him out of my sight.

     As the Assistants disperse, Maroon approaches Valiant.

                               MAROON
               Valiant, did you see the rabbit?

                               VALIANT
               He was blowin' his lines, all right.
               So what?

                               MAROON
               So what?  He's already put me three
               weeks behind on the shooting schedule!

     Now an EDITH HEAD-TYPE hustles up to show Maroon several
     costume designs.

                               COSTUMER
               Your reaction, R.K.?

     Maroon quickly checks out the drawing.

                               MAROON
               No!  That's not funny.
 
     She flips another drawing.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               That's funny.  Put a homburg on him
               it'll even be funnier.  Huh, Valiant?

     He grabs the pad and shows Valiant.  The rendering is of a
     hippo in a pink polka-dot tu-tu.

                               VALIANT
                      (deadpan)
               Yeah, that'd be a riot.

     Maroon responds to Valiant's sarcasm with raised eyebrows.

                               MAROON
               Boy, I hope what you have ain't
               contagious or I'll be out of business.

     He hands the pad back to the designer, who departs.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               How much do you know about show
               business, Valiant?

                               VALIANT
               Only there's no business like it, no
               business I know.

     Valiant watches an ALLIGATOR in a rebel uniform dragging a
     brace of cannons and several TOADSTOOLS parade by.

                               MAROON
               Yeah, and there's no business as
               expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over
               budget on the latest Bunnysitter
               cartoon and it's all because that
               rabbit can't keep his mind on his work.
               And you know why?

                               VALIANT
               One too many safes dropped on his head?

                               MAROON
               Nah, that goes with the territory.
               He's a stunt bunny.

     Maroon takes a copy of the "Hollywood Tattler" out of his
     pocket.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               Here's the problem...
                      (reads)
               "Seen cooing over calamari with
               notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica
               Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".
                      (looks up)
               His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's
               Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him
               up.

                               VALIANT
               So what do you want me to do?

                               MAROON
               Get me a couple juicy pictures.
               Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up
               with.

                               VALIANT
               I don't work in Toontown.

                               MAROON
               You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife
               sings at an underground Toon revue
               joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You
               can catch her in action there.

                               VALIANT
               The job's gonna cost you a hundred
               bucks.

                               MAROON
               A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.

                               VALIANT
               So's the job.

     Valiant starts to walk away.

                               MAROON
               All right, all right... You got your
               hundred bucks.

     Maroon turns, snaps his fingers.  His Assistant appears out
     of nowhere with Maroon's checkbook and a pen.  The Assistant
     turns and stoops so that Maroon can write the check on his
     back.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               Fifty now, fifty when you deliver the
               pictures.

     Maroon tears the check off and hands it to Valiant.  Suddenly
     Valiant ducks in reflex to a large shadow that passes
     overhead.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing;
                       chuckles)
               Kinda jumpy aren't you, Valiant?  It's
               just Dumbo.


     ABOVE THEIR HEADS - DUMBO

     swoops back and forth, then hovers, ears flapping like a
     hummingbird.

                               MAROON
               I got him on loan from Disney.

                               VALIANT
               Aren't you the lucky one...

     Valiant grabs the check from Maroon and starts for the gate.

                               MAROON
               When will I hear from you?

                               VALIANT
               As soon as is humanly possible.

     We FOLLOW Valiant out the gate under a wrought iron sign that
     reads "Maroon Cartoon Studios".  As he starts across the road
     he's almost run over by a Toon roadster that ROARS out of the
     gates.  When it BLASTS ITS HORN, it's the FIRST FIVE NOTES
     from the WOODY WOODPECKER SONG:  "HA-HA-HA-HA-HA".  Valiant
     jumps back as the roadster passes.  WOODY THE WOODPECKER'S
     behind the wheel with a self-important smile on his face.
     Valiant angrily waves the cloud of Toon dust away.

                               VALIANT
                      (coughs)
               Damn Toons.


     ACROSS THE STREET - A TROLLEY CAR

     is slowing to a stop in front of the studio.  It's a Pacific
     and Electric "Red Car", part of a vast system of electric
     trollies that once criss-crossed the L.A. Basin.  Valiant
     steps onto the "Red Car".  He reaches into his pocket to give
     the CONDUCTOR his nickel fare.  But he comes up with a
     handful of lint.  He holds out the check.

                               CONDUCTOR
               What do I look like, a bank?

     The Conductor jerks his thumb toward the door.  Valiant
     suffers the public humiliation,of having to step down past
     the rest of the boarding passengers.  He walks around to the
     back of the Red Car where a gang of TEN-YEAR-OLDS are
     loitering.  When the BELL SOUNDS and the Red Car starts to
     pull away, the Kids make a dash for a place on the cow
     catcher.  Valiant joins them.  We HOLD as the Red Car moves
     away and the street urchins regard their older partner in
     crime with curiosity.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:


     A BILLBOARD SIGN

     It reads:  "L.A.'s Pacific and Electric Red Car -- America's
     Finest Public Transportation System".  PAN DOWN to see that
     the sign is on the roof of the trolley terminal.  Red Cars
     are going in and out of the shed.  MOVE IN on one car
     approaching the terminal from down the street.  As it passes
     by...


     VALIANT

     hops off his freeloader's seat on the back,

                               KID
               So long, mister.

     Valiant waves laconically.

                               VALIANT
               Thanks for the cigarettes.

     We FOLLOW Valiant as he crosses the street to a seedy
     bungalow.  A note is push-pinned to the door.


     CLOSE - NOTE

     It says:  "Tomorrow's Friday... Well?  Dolores".


     VALIANT

     takes the note and walks back across the street toward the
     terminal.  He climbs up a flight of stairs, heading for a bar
     on the mezzanine.  The bar sports a red neon sign that used
     to blink, "The Terminal Station Bar".  But now it just says,
     "Terminal".


     INT. TERMINAL BAR - DAY

     The place must have been pretty swanky at the turn of the
     century when it was built in the first burst of enthusiasm
     over the new public transportation system.  It's in the motif
     of a trolley car.  There's a large map on the wail above the
     bar showing all the different lines.  Behind the bar is
     DOLORES.  If you scraped off all the makeup, you'd find an
     attractive woman in her late thirties.  She ministers to a
     rag-tag assortment of Hollywood low-lifes -- who are truly at
     the end of the line.


     VALIANT

     enters this den, lets his eyes adjust for a moment, then
     bellies up to the bar.  He finds a spot between a ONE-ARMED
     BLACK SOLDIER and a MIDGET stretched out on the bar passed
     out.  Now a TROLLEY RUMBLES underneath them.  The bar starts
     to shake like an earthquake, the lights flicker.  All the
     drinkers, observing a time honored ritual, lift their glasses
     simultaneously to avoid spilling any drops.  Even the Midget
     lifts his head until the trolley has passed.  Valiant reaches
     over the bar and blind-grabs a bottle of rye he obviously
     knows is there.  He pours himself a shot.

                               VALIANT
               Hey, fellas, what's the good word?

                               SOLDIER
               Lost my job.

     An ARTHRITIC COWBOY pipes up.

                               COWBOY
               Mule died.

     A DEAF-MUTE scribbles a note on a pad hanging around his
     neck.  He hands the note to Valiant.  It says "My girl dumped
     me".  Valiant pats him on the back, consoling.

                               VALIANT
               Well, you know what they say about
               dames, Augie...

     Then Valiant mouths the rest of it for Augie's benefit only.
     Augie reads his lips, then starts to roar silently, slapping
     his thigh.  Now Dolores makes her way down the bar.  She
     grabs the Midget by the suspenders and slides him out of the
     way.

                               DOLORES
               So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie?
               Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a
               dame who took a hundred bucks out of
               the till so your landlord would't
               throw you out of your dump.  And it was
               a dame who trusted you for the money
               when no one else in town would.  And
               it's a dame who's tired of waitin' for
               you to straighten yourself out and get
               a job!

                               VALIANT
               Would this be the same dame who's going
               to feel awfully foolish when she finds
               out I've got her money.

     Valiant slides the check across the bar.  Dolores studies it.
     She calms down a little.

                               DOLORES
               This is fifty bucks.  I need
               seventy-five before they check the
               books tomorrow.

                               VALIANT
               You'll have it in the morning.  Now be
               a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to
               put in my pocket.

                               DOLORES
               Is this paper even good?

                               VALIANT
               Check the scrawl.

                               DOLORES
                      (reads)
               R.K. Maroon.

     Now ANGELO, a Neanderthal sitting a few stools down, is
     tapping the shell of a hardboiled egg.

                               ANGELO
               Maroon?  Valiant, don't tell me you're
               workin' for a Toon?  Who's your client?
               Chilly Willy or Screwy Squirrel?

     Angelo chuckles at his own joke and goes to eat his egg.
     Suddenly Valiant darkens.  He grabs Angelo by the shirt and
     pulls him up to his face.

                               VALIANT
               Get this straight, greaseball.  I'm not
               workin' for a Toon!  I'd never work for
               a Toon!  Got that?

     Valiant jams the whole egg into Angelo's mouth, turns and
     storms out the door.  Angelo sputters and spits out the egg.

                               ANGELO
               What's his problem?

                               DOLORES
               Toon killed his brother.


     EXT. INK & PAINT CLUB - NIGHT

     Valiant knocks on the door of, a non-descript building in a
     run-down factory area.  A speakeasy style peephole slides
     open REVEALING the face of a TOON GORILLA.  Valiant offers
     the password.

                               VALIANT
               Walt sent me.

     The peephole slides closed and after a beat the door swings
     open.


     INT. CLUB

     The Gorilla, dressed in a tux, gives Valiant the once over.
     Valiant resents the assessment.

                               VALIANT
               Like your monkey suit.

                               GORILLA
               Wise ass...

     We FOLLOW Valiant down the hall toward the main room.  We can
     HEAR LAUGHTER and ZANY MUSIC from within.


     INT. MAIN ROOM

     When Valiant steps through the doorway, we see the place is
     no dive.  It's a white tablecloth nightclub on a par with the
     El Morroco or the Garden of Allah.  Behind the bar A
     CATERPILLAR BARTENDER is using his many arms to shake and
     pour several drinks at once.  Meanwhile a dozen PENGUIN
     WAITERS are gliding back and forth along the tables serving
     drinks to the well-heeled crowd.


     ON STAGE

     DONALD DUCK and DAFFY DUCK are seated opposite each other at
     matching grand pianos.  What begins as a decorous Duck duet
     on a Tchaikovsky piece (complete with knuckle-cracking,
     seat-spinning preparations) quickly accelerates to a loony
     game of one-upsmanship between these two irascible Ducks.
     There is keyboard stomping, lid-banging, piano wire plucking
     zaniness.


     THE AUDIENCE

     is HOWLING.  People are wiping the tears from their eyes
     they're laughing so hard.  All except...


     VALIANT

     He lights a cigarette impassively, not humored by the Toon
     hijinx.  He spots an empty table off to the side and makes
     his way towards it.  A SILLY GEEZER in a loud suit is at the
     next table.  The Geezer nods to him soberly as Valiant pulls
     Out the chair and sits down.  A LOUD FLATULENCE SOUND erupts
     from under Valiant.  The Geezer slaps his thigh with the
     hilarity of it all.

                               GEEZER
               Will you listen to that?  It's a pip!
               I'm thinking of callin' it a Whoopee
               Cushion.

     Valiant reaches under himself and comes up holding a deflated
     rubber bladder.  The Geezer retrieves it from him.

                               GEEZER
                       (continuing)
                No hard feelings, I hope.  Put 'er
                there...

     The Geezer grabs Valiant's hand before he can say no.  We
     HEAR A BUZZ.  Valiant retracts his hand as if shocked.  The
     Geezer howls with laughter and turns his palm to Eddie.

                               GEEZER
                      (continuing)
               Hand buzzer... real gasser.

     Valiant rolls his eyes and grabs a Penguin as it glides by.

                               VALIANT
               Scotch.

                               PENGUIN
               There's a two drink minimum.

                               VALIANT
               Just as long as there's no maximum.

                               GEEZER
               Waiter, I'll sign my check now.

     The Penguin puts a bill down on the Geezer's table and zips
     off.  The Geezer takes a fountain pen out of his jacket and
     writes on the bill.  But there doesn't seem to be any ink
     coming out.  He shakes and shakes the pen to get it flowing.
     It flows all right.  Ink splatters all over Valiant's shirt
     and pants.  Valiant looks down at the stain, doing a slow
     burn.  The Geezer starts laughing.  Valiant jumps up and
     grabs him by the lapels.

                               VALIANT
               That's it for you, pops!

                               GEEZER
                      (freaked)
               Calm down, son.  Look, the ink is gone.

     Valiant looks down at his shirt.  The stain is gone.

                               GEEZER
                      (continuing)
               See?  It disappears.

                               VALIANT
               Well, why don't you make like the ink?

     Valiant drops him into his chair and returns to his seat.
     The Penguin glides up with his drinks.  Valiant swallows the
     first one with one quick jerk of the head.


     ON STAGE

     Donald and Daffy's PIANO COMPETITION has reached a CRESCENDO
     of mayhem.  They've got the axes out, and in time with the
     MUSIC they reduce their pianos to matchsticks.  At the
     completion of the piece, they step to the front of the stage
     and with great decorum, arms around each other, they take
     their bows.  The curtain comes down to GREAT APPLAUSE.  We
     HEAR SFX of CRASHING AND BASHING backstage.  Now from behind
     Valiant, we HEAR a familiar high-pitched VOICE.

                               CIGARETTE GIRL
               Cigars... cigarettes... Eddie?

     Valiant turns to see BETTY BOOP standing with a box of
     tobacco wares strapped around her neck.  In contrast to all
     the other Toons, Betty's in black and white.

                               BETTY BOOP
                      (continuing)
               Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We
               miss you in Toontown.

                               VALIANT
               Wish I could say the same.  What're you
               doin' here, Betty?

                               BETTY BOOP
               Work's been slow for me since the
               cartoons went to color.  But I still
               got it, Eddie...
                      (sings)
               'Boop boop be-doop'.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, you still got it, Betty.
                      (indicates
                       Geezer)
               Who's Mr. Jocularity?

                               BETTY BOOP
                      (leans in)
               That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.

                               VALIANT
               Shoulda guessed.

                               BETTY BOOP
               He comes here every night to see
               Jessica Rabbit.

                               VALIANT
               Big on the musical comedy, huh?

                               BETTY BOOP
               Sounds like you ve never seen her,
               Eddie.

     Now the lights dim and Betty moves on.


     ON STAGE

     the dour DROOPY walks out with the spotlight following him.
     He's the evening's emcee.

                               DROOPY
                      (deadpan)
               Hello, everybody.  I hope you're all
               having as much fun as I am.  I have a
               small announcement to make.  Jessica
               Rabbit will not be able to sing
               tonight.

     There's a ROAR OF DISAPPROVAL from the men in the crowd.
     They shower him with debris.

                               DROOPY
                      (continuing;
                       deadpan)
               I was merely jesting.  Without further
               ado... here's woman times two,
               Toontown's own chanteuse par
               excellance... Jessica Rabbit!

     There is excited APPLAUSE as the lights dim. A TOON COMBO
     made up of CROWS in shades STRIKES UP the intro to the smokey
     song, "Why Don't You Do Right".  A spotlight hits the
     curtain. Now a curvaceous leg pokes out, teasingly.  The
     crowd goes wild as the rest of the body belonging to the leg
     emerges.  JESSICA RABBIT is a generously endowed red-headed
     bombshell.  She's a humanoid Toon... in her case, more
     beautiful than human.  Her figure is testimony to what a guy
     can do with a pencil and a fertile imagination,


     REACTION - VALIANT

     This is not quite the bunny he expected Roger to be married
     to.  His jaw drops.  And his reaction is mirrored all around
     the room.  The men are panting so hard you couldn't keep a
     match lit.


     CLOSEUP - JESSICA

     as she steps to the mike.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (sings)
               'You had plenty of money back
                  in '22
               You let other woman make a fool
                  of you
               Why don't you do right.
               Like some other men do...
               Get out of here and
               Get me the money too...'

     Jessica takes the mike and comes off the stage.  Slinkily.
     she wanders among the tables, teasing the men as she goes.

     Now there's a HOWL from behind Valiant.  A Tex Avery type
     TOON WOLF, who came masquerading as a human, couldn't help
     but show his true colors at the sight of Jessica.  He HOWLS
     as if it were a full moon.  His tongue rolls out of his head
     and piles up on the floor like so much clothesline.  His
     eyeballs telescope out of his head.  And finally, the Wolf
     levitates and snaps rigid like an open jacknife.  As the Wolf
     makes a rush for the stage, the Gorilla Bouncer grabs him by
     the suspenders.  The Wolf, legs spinning madly, practically
     knocks Valiant's table over as he grabs at Jessica.  But the
     Wolf has come to the end of his suspenders.  He snaps back
     toward the Gorilla who is holding an anvil in front of the
     suspenders.  CLANG!  The Wolf hits the anvil and slides to
     the floor.  The Gorilla calmly whisks him into a dustpan and
     carries him out.


     JESSICA

     like all good saloon singers, has continued her act
     undaunted.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (singing)
               'Why don't you do right.
               Like some other men do...'

     She sashays over to the Geezer's table.  Teasingly, she
     swirls the whisps of white hair onto his head into a Dairy
     Queen.  He giggles gleefully and makes a grab at Jessica.
     But she slips out of his grasp like mercury.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               'You ain't got no money
               Ain't got no use for you...'

     Now Jessica works her way over to Eddie.  She stops at his
     table and sings tauntingly.  Then with a flourish, she throws
     herself in his lap, and belts out the finale.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               'So get out of here...
               And get me the money toooo!'

     There is RAUCOUS APPLAUSE when she finishes.  Jessica looks
     deep into Eddie's eyes.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               Thanks for your lap.

     Before Eddie can reply, she jumps off, and slinks offstage,
     leaving Eddie a pile of human wreckage.  Valiant slugs the
     rest of his drink down to put out the fire in his libido.

     When the lights come up, Valiant looks over to where Acme is
     slicking down his eyebrows and patting his hair down.  He
     stands, picks up a bouquet of roses from the chair beside
     him, and as he passes Valiant's table, gives him a big wink.
     Valiant watches Acme disappear backstage.  He stands, drops
     a couple bucks on the table, and follows after him.


     BACKSTAGE

     Valiant steps past the curtain, keeping a discreet distance.
     He follows Marvin Acme down a corridor and around the corner.
     Acme stops and knocks on a dressing room door.  After a
     moment, it opens and Acme goes inside.  Valiant checks over
     his shoulder, but the backstage area is empty.  He eases over
     to the door and puts his eye to the keyhole.


     POV THROUGH KEYHOLE

     Jessica is seated at her dressing table.  Acme is on his
     knees next to her, kissing his way up her gloved hand, eyes
     closed in ecstasy.  Jessica takes her hand out of the glove
     and starts combing her hair, leaving Marvin kissing a
     suspended Toon glove.


     ANGLE ON VALIANT

     while he continues his peeping.  The Gorilla bouncer sneaks
     up behind him.

                               GORILLA
               Hey, whaddaya think you're doin',
               chump?

                               VALIANT
               Who're you callin' chump, chimp?

     The Gorilla smiles sadistically when he recognizes Valiant.

                               GORILLA
               Oh, it's da comedian...

     The Gorilla grabs Valiant by the belt and lifts him off the
     ground.  He opens the fire door and heaves Valiant out.


     EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

     Valiant comes flying out the door and CRASHES into a bunch of
     garbage cans in the alley.  The Gorilla stands in the doorvay
     regarding the dazed Valiant.

                               GORILLA
               And don't lemme catch your peepin' face
               around here again.  Got it?

                               VALIANT
               Ooga-booga.

     The Gorilla slams the door.  Valiant picks himself up out of
     the garbage.  He brushes himself off, then starts down the
     alley toward the rear of the building.  We FOLLOW him around
     the corner where he stops under Jessica's dressing room
     window.  He drags over a milk crate to stand on, takes a
     small camera out of his pocket and opens the bellows.  He
     stands on the crate and aims the camera through the corner of
     the window, as we HEAR the MUFFLED CONVERSATION from within.

                               ACME (O.S.)
               Are we going to play pattycake tonight?

                               JESSICA RABBIT (0.5.)
               Marvin, I have a headache...

                               ACME (O.S.)
                      (hurt)
               But you promised...

                               JESSICA RABBIT (O.S.)
               Oh, all right.  But this time take that
               hand buzzer off...

     Valiant's eyes widen in disgust.

                               VALIANT
               Jesus Christ...

     As he starts CLICKING pictures...

                                              CUT TO:


     EXT. MAROON STUDIO - LATE NIGHT

     There's one light on in the Administration building.


     INT. MAROON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     It's a large art deco office with walls covered with photos
     of Maroon and various celebrities, human and Toon.  R.K.
     Maroon is seated behind his desk.  Standing nearby is
     Valiant.  They are both regarding a hysterical Roger Rabbit,
     who's holding a set of 8 x lO glossies.  He's WAILING and
     CRYING, Toon tears flooding off him in a torrent.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Pattycake!  Pattycake!

                               VALIANT
               Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a
               good pair of shoes over it.

     ANGLE ON RUG

     Roger's tears have formed a puddle around the desk.  Valiant
     lifts a well-worn oxford and shakes the water off it.


     MAROON

     hands Roger his handkerchief.  Roger AAH-OO-GA'S his nose.

                               MAROON
               Take comfort, son, you're not the first
               man whose wife played pattycake on him.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I don't believe it.  I won't believe
               it.

                               MAROON
               The pictures don't lie.  Mr. Valiant
               here took them himself.

     Roger takes another look at the pictures.


     CLOSE - PHOTOS

     They're shots of Jessica Rabbit and Marvin Acme seated knee
     to knee, caught in the act of slapping palms... really
     playing pattycake.


     BACK TO SCENE

     Maroon gets up and crosses to a bar table set up by the
     window.  He pours a drink from a crystal decanter as Roger
     starts sobbing again.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               But Jessy... she's the light of my
               life, the apple of my eye, the cream in
               my coffee...

     Valiant eyes the booze longingly as he mutters to himself.

                               VALIANT
               Well, you better start thinkin' about
               drinkin' it black.

                               MAROON
               Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's
               been my friend and neighbor for thirty
               years.

     Maroon gestures out the window.  We see a blinking neon sign
     on the roof of the building across the street -- "Acme - If
     It's Acme - It's A Gasser!"

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               Who would have thought he was the Sugar
               Daddy?

     Maroon turns and carries the drink to Roger.  Meanwhile,
     Valiant sidles over to the bar to help himself.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               Well, the important thing now Roger, is
               to put all this behind you.
                      (hands him
                       drink)
               Drink this, son, you'll feel better.

     Roger takes the glass and shoots it down in one gulp.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               I know this all seems painful now, but
               you'll find someone new.  Won't he, Mr,
               Valiant?

     Eddie has just picked up the decanter to pour one for
     himself.

                               VALIANT
                      (over shoulder)
               Oh, yeah.  Good lookin' guy like him.
               Dames'll be breakin' his door down.


     CLOSE - ROGER

     The booze is taking its effect.  There's a RUMBLE like a
     volcano about to erupt.  Suddenly Roger's head turns into a
     Toon steam whistle SHRIEKING.  The HIGH PITCH causes glass
     objects in the room to SHATTER... including the crystal
     decanter that Valiant's holding in his hand.  It EXPLODES,
     soaking his suit with booze.  Valiant looks down at the
     damage, completely exasperated.

                               VALIANT
               Son-of-a-bitch...
                      (turns)
               Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now,
               so about the rest of my fee...

                               MAROON
               Sure, Valiant, sure...

     Maroon sits at the desk and writes a check.

                               MAROON
               Being experienced in these matrimonial
               matters, you have any advice for our
               friend here?

     Valiant crosses to the desk and takes the check.

                               VALIANT
               My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get
               yourself a quickie divorce.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Divorce?  Never!

     Suddenly Roger jumps onto Maroon's desk and grabs Valiant by
     the lapels.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Marriage is a two-way street and we're
               just experiencing a detour!  Jessica
               and I are going to get back together.
               We're going to be happy!   H-A-P-P-I!

     Roger zips off the desk and CRASHES out the window, leaving a
     rabbit outline in the glass... backlit by the blinking Acme
     sign.  Maroon and Valiant walk to the window and look out the
     rabbit-shaped hole in the window.

                               VALIANT
               At least he took it well.


     INT. VALIANT'S BUNGALOW - CLOSE - EMPTY BOOZE BOTTLE - EARLY
     MORNING

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL the bottle's on the floor next to the
     couch Valiant's passed out on.  He's still dressed in his
     clothes.  PAN the small studio apartment.  In the
     kitchen/alcove, Valiant has created a makeshift darkroom.  We
     see a curtain on a clothesline.  Various trays, and some
     pictures clipped up on clothespins.  The pictures depict
     Jessica Rabbit and Marvin Acme in various states of
     pattycake.  Now there is LOUD POUNDING on the door.  But it
     doesn't break through VaLiant's subconscious for several
     seconds.  Finally, he rouses, gets up and walks a crooked
     line to the door.  Valiant opens it and squints into the
     excruciating sunlight.  When his eyes focus, REVEAL a
     hang-dog POLICE DETECTIVE holding Eddie's morning paper.

                               VALIANT
               Lieutenant Santino... how ya doin'?

     Santino ignores the question and regards Valiant with a
     mixture of disgust and pity.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for
               a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.

                               VALIANT
               That's what you woke me up for?

     Santino flops open the morning paper.  Valiant's eyes narrow
     as he reads it.  The headline screams:  "TOON KILLS MAN!" And
     underneath:  "Marvin Acme Murdered at the Hands of Jealous
     Rabbit".  Santino throws the paper on the sofa.

                               LT. SANTINO
               You got trouble, Eddie.

     EXT. ACME FACTORY - DAY

     An L.A. police car turns into the yard of the Acme factory
     and pulls up in front of the old factory building.  There's
     all kinds of official activity in the yard... cop cars, a
     Coroner's truck, etcetera.

     Valiant and Santino get out of the police car.  Santino
     starts into the factory.  But he realizes Valiant's not
     following him.  He turns to see Valiant looking over the wall
     behind the factory, transfixed.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Now what?

                               VALIANT
               Just haven't been this close to
               Toontown for awhile.


     VALIANT'S POV

     The sky above the wall is a different color, a little bit
     more vibrant, a "Toon Blue", you might call it.


     SANTINO

     walks back and takes Valiant's arm.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Let's go, somebody wants to see you.

     Santino leads Valiant into the factory.


     INT. FACTORY - DAY

     It's a large warehouse filled with stacks of Toon gags,..
     boxes of dynamite, giant slingshots, boulders, everything
     you've ever seen in a Roadrunner cartoon.  Santino stops
     where a large black safe is imbedded at a cockeyed angle in
     the floor.  A FORENSIC TEAM is at work around the safe.
     They're chalking the outline around a body half obscured by
     the safe.

                               LT. SANTINO
               They say the rabbit got the safe idea
               from a cartoon he was makin' the other
               day.

                               VALIANT
               What a gasser.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Wait here...

     Santino walks to Acme's glassed office where a sobbing
     Jessica Rabbit is being interrogated.  We can only see her,
     not the person doing the interrogating.  Valiant sidles over
     to where the Forensic Guys are dusting the photographs he had
     taken for prints.  One of the Forensic Guys looks up from his
     work.

                               FORENSIC #1
               Say, didn't you used to be Eddie
               Valiant?

     Valiant ignores the slings and arrows and surveys the scene
     of the crime.  The door of the safe is ajar.  Valiant tries
     to look inside.  Forensic #2 closes the door with his knee.

     Now we HEAR the VOICE of Jessica Rabbit from behind them.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Mr. Valiant?

     Valiant turns to the voice.  WHAP!  Jessica slaps him hard
     enough across the face to make his head turn.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               I hope you're proud of yourself.

     She turns on her heel and storms off, sobbing into a
     handkerchief.  Valiant, rubbing his jaw, looks after her.  So
     do the Forensic Guys.

                               FORENSIC #1
               She likes you, Valiant.

                               FORENSIC #2
                      (low wolf
                       whistle)
               When they drew her, they broke the
               pencil.

     Now two WHITE-JACKETS from the Coroner's office start to
     carry Acme out on a stretcher.  As they pass Valiant, a hand
     still wearing a Hand Buzzer flops out.  Valiant grabs it --
     stopping the stretcher.

                               VALIANT
               Makes you wonder what in the world she
               was doin' with a guy who didn't clean
               his fingernails.


     CLOSE - HAND

     Imbedded under the fingernails is a reddish-brown substance.

                               FORENSIC #1
               So... it's blood.


     VALIANT

     peels a piece of it off... it chips and falls to the ground.
     He squats to examine it.

                               VALIANT
               It's not blood, it's paint.

     Suddenly the end of a cane comes down on Valiant's hand,
     pinning it to the floor.  Valiant follows the cane UP to it's
     gavel-shaped head -- past black pants, a black robe, to a
     cadaver-like complected face, and a large hooked proboscis.
     The head is shaved.  Rimless tinted glasses obscure the eyes.
     Although he's human, the total appearance is frighteningly
     vulture-like.  JUDGE DOOM is accompanied by Santino.

                               DOOM
               Is this man removing evidence from the
               scene of a crime?

                               LT. SANTINO
                      (deferential)
               Uh... no, Judge Doom.  Valiant here was
               just about to hand it over, weren't
               you, Valiant?

                               DOOM
               I'll take that.

     Doom takes his cane off Eddie's hand and reaches out for the
     paint chip.  Valiant palms a piece and drops a smaller piece
     into Doom's hand.  Doom examines it.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Looks like the deceased grabbed a
               handful of your client's pantaloons,
               Mr. Valiant.

     Valiant stands to face the Judge, who towers over him.

                               VALIANT
               He's not my client.  I was workin' for
               R.K. Maroon.

                               DOOM
               Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told
               us the rabbit became quite agitated
               when you showed him the pictures, and
               said nothing would stand in the way of
               him getting his wife back.  Is that
               true?

                               VALIANT
               Hey, pal, do I look like a
               stenographer?

                               LT. SANTINO
               Watch your mouth, Eddie, he's a judge.

     Doom smiles thinly at Valiant, tarns and walks with purpose
     towards the door.  Santino and Valiant follow.

                               DOOM
               The rabbit's movements are fairly clear
               after leaving the Maroon Studios.  He
               ran across the street, jimmied this
               door open, hoisted the safe on a block
               and tackle...


     EXT. ACME FACTORY

     Doom leads them outside and indicates a window.

                               DOOM
               ... then stood out here waiting for his
               prey.  After he cold-bloodedly
               accomplished his task, he went home.
               He was almost apprehended there by my
               men.

     Doom nods his head toward a group of sinister WEASLES (a la
     Disney's "Wind In The Willows").  They're loitering by a
     dogcatcher's wagon with "Toontown Control" on the side,
     cleaning their fingernails with switchblades and polishing
     Toon revolvers.
         
                               VALIANT
               Men?  They look more like weasles to
               me.

                               DOOM
               Yes, I find that weasles have a special
               gift for the work.
                      (turns back to
                       Valiant)
               The rabbit didn't contact you by any
               chance, did he?

                               VALIANT
               Why would he contact me?  I just took
               some lousy pictures.

                               DOOM
               So you wouldn't have any idea where he
               might be?

                               VALIANT
               Have you tried Walla Walla?  Kokomo's
               very nice this time of year.

     Doom steps into Valiant's face.

                               DOOM
               I'm surprised you aren't more
               cooperative, Mr. Valiant.  A human has
               been murdered by a Toon.  Don't you
               appreciate the magnitude of that?  My
               goal as Judge of Toontown, has been to
               rein in the insanity.  To bring a
               semblance of law and order to a place
               where no civilized person has ever been
               able to step foot.
               The only way to do that is to make the
               Toons respect the law.

     Suddenly a "YA-HA-HOOEY" interrupts his pontification, as a
     scruffy little TOON GOPHER comes hurtling over the wall from
     the Toontown side.  He's holding his blackened rear end...
     apparently the result of a run-in with a stick of dynamite.
     BONK!  The Gopher hits Doom in the back of the head, sending
     them both sprawling.  The Gopher picks himself up and shakes
     off the effects of the concusion.  When he sees who he's
     knocked down, he panics.

                               GOPHER
                      (petrified)
               Judge Doom!  Here, let me get that for
               ya.

     He whips a clothes brush out of his back pocket and furiously
     tries to clean the Judge's cloak.  Doom picks up the Gopher
     by the scruff of the neck and gets to his feet.

                               DOOM
               Why, you filthy little vagrant, you've
               soiled my robe!

                               GOPHER
               It's cleanin' up real good. Judge.

                               DOOM
               You've defiled a symbol of justice.

     As Doom carries the Gopher to the "Toontown Control" wagon,
     Valiant shoots a look to Santino.

                               VALIANT
                      (aside)
               Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?

                               LT. SANTINO
               No one knows.  He bought the election
               a few years back.  He's been rulin'
               Toontown ever since.

     When Doom gets to the wagon, the Weasles open up the back.
     In place of steel bars is a stream of fluid.  A Weasle turns
     a key and the flow of liquid stops.  The Gopher starts
     kicking furiously, trying to avoid the lock-up.

                                       GOPHER
                Oh, no, Judge, please, please, lemme
                go.  I think I hear my mother callin'
                me.

     Finally, the Gopher breaks free and makes a desperate dash
     for the wall.  Doom watches him run and calmly turns to where
     his car is parked.  It's a black Lincoln touring car with an
     ugly bird-like hood ornament.

                               DOOM
               Voltaire... the Gopher!

     Suddenly. the hood ornament SQUAWKS to life.  It's a hideous
     TOON VULTURE.  The Vulture flaps into flight.

     Just as the Gopher is about to make it over the top of the
     wall the Vulture's talons sink into his rear end and lift him
     airborne.  The Vulture drops the Gopher off with the Weasles.
     They pin him down.

                               GOPHER
               Hey, don't I have any rights?

                               DOOM
               Yes, you do... to a swift and speedy
               trial.

     One of the Weasles retrieves a briefcase from the sedan, puts
     it on the hood and snaps it open.  Twelve TOON KANGAROOS pop
     up, arranged in a jury box.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Court is now in session.

     He raps the Gopher on the head with the gavel end of his
     cane.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               The defendant is charged with vagrancy,
               assault and resisting arrest.  How do
               you find him?

     The Kangaroo court delivers the verdict instantly. Twelve
     LITTLE KANGAROOS pop up out of their Momma's pouches, holding
     up small cards, each with a letter spelling Y-O-U A-R-E
     G-U-I-L-T-Y.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Guilty as charged.  Case closed!

     Doom slams the briefcase shut.  He turns his attention back
     to the Gopher.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               I hereby sentence you to the dip!

                               GOPHER
               Oh no, not the dip!  Anything but the
               dip!  I'm too young to die...

     As the Judge pulls on a black rubber glove, the Weasles take
     out a stainless steel tub WHEEZING with sadistic glee.  They
     fill it from a spigot on the truck.

                               VALIANT
               What's with the dip?

                               LT. SANTINO
               That's how he gets rid of the
               troublemakers.  It's a combination of
               acetone, turpentine and paint remover.
               He calls it the...  Final Solution.


     THE GOPHER

     is wriggling and SCREAMING bloody murder as Doom lifts him up
     and holds him over the tub.  Then, as he's lowered into the
     solution, he starts to disappear. His pathetic SCREAMS are
     snuffed MID-YELP.

                               GOPHER
               Help!  Help!  He...

     The Gopher's gone.  All that's left of him is a paint slick
     on the surface of the liquid.

                               VALIANT
               Jesus.

     Doom pulls off the black rubber gloves finger by finger and
     hands them to a Weasle.  He turns to Valiant.

                               DOOM
                They're not kid gloves, Mr. Valiant.
                but that's how we handle things in
                Toontown.  I would think you'd
                appreciate that.

     He gets into his car, he pauses and looks back at Valiant.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               After all, didn't a Toon kill your
               brother?


     INT. TERMINAL BAR - DAY

     Dolores is behind the bar cutting lemon peels and preparing
     for the day's bartending.  There's one early customer, a
     grey-haired TROLLEYMAN in his Red Car uniform.  His hat's on
     the stool next to him and he's already drunk.  The door
     opens.  It's Valiant.  He walks over to the bar, reaches for
     a bottle and a shot glass and helps himself.  Dolores picks
     up a copy of the morning paper.

                               DOLORES
               Hey, Eddie, looks like you really
               stepped in it this time.

                               VALIANT
               What are you complaining about?  Here's
               your fifty bucks.

     Valiant slides the check across the bar.

                               TROLLEYMAN
                      (mumbling to
                       himself)
               Thirty-five years and all I got to show
               for it is a ticket punch.

                               VALIANT
               What's with Earl?

                               DOLORES
               A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some
               big company called Cloverleaf
               Industries.

                               VALIANT
               No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?

                               DOLORES
               Bastards put him on notice.

     Valiant picks up his glass. lifts it in toast to the
     Trolleyman.

                               VALIANT
               Here's to the pencil pushers.  May they
               all get lead poisoning.

     Now the Trolleyman unsteadily climbs up on his stool to get
     close to the Holy Grail... the Red Car route map over the
     bar.

                               TROLLEYMAN
                      (wistfully)
               The old Number Six Line... who'da
               thought they'd close that one down?

                               DOLORES
               Eddie, get him down from there.  He's
               gonna break his neck.

     Eddie grabs Earl around the legs and throws him over his
     shoulder like a sack of potatoes.  He carries him over to a
     booth and puts him down carefully, covering him with a
     tablecloth.

                               TROLLEYMAN
               Took you right to Toontown, it did.

                               VALIANT
               I know, I know... poor S.O.B.

     Valiant walks back to his drink at the bar.

                               DOLORES
               Do you think the rabbit did it?

                               VALIANT
               I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
               Make that a round.

     Valiant and Dolores look down the bar, but there's no one
     there.  Finally the familiar cowlick of Baby Herman rises to
     the top of the bar as he clambers up a barstool.

                               DOLORES
               We don't serve formula. Snookums.

                               BABY HERMAN
               You serve martinis, doncha?

                               DOLORES
               Yeah...

    Baby Herman slides his baby bottle down the bar to Dolores.

                               BABY HERMAN
               Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be
               wet.
                      (to Valiant)
               You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby
               Herman.

                               VALIANT
               I know who you are.  Kinda out of your
               neighborhood, aren't you?

                               BABY HERMAN
               Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a
               friend of mine's bein' framed.

                               VALIANT
               You mean the rabbit?  They got him
               cold.

                               BABY HERMAN
               You don't believe that.  I mean. the
               guy's an idiot, a moron, a complete
               fool...  but he'd never kill anyone.
               I know the guy.

     Dolores brings Baby Herman his baby bottle cocktail.

                               BABY HERMAN
                      (continuing)
               Thanks, doll.

     When Dolores turns around, Baby Herman pats her on the
     bottom.

                               DOLORES
                      (over her
                       shoulder)
               Oh, a ladies man, huh?

                               BABY HERMAN
                      (sotto voce; to
                       Valiant)
               My problem is I got a fifty-year-old
               lust and a three-year-old dinkie.

                               VALIANT
               My problem is I come here to drink in
               peace.  So if you don't mind...

                               BABY HERMAN
               C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole
               thing smell a bit funny to you?  I
               mean, no offense, but how did a
               mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in
               the first place?

                               DOLORES
                      (chiming in)
               Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an
               ad in the Yellow Pages.

                               VALIANT
               Thanks for the vote of confidence.

                               BABY HERMAN
               And another thing, the paper said no
               will was found.  But every Toon knows
               Acme had a will and, in it he promised
               to leave Toontown to the Toons.

                               VALIANT
               So where is it then?

                               BABY HERMAN
               Somebody took it from him.  That's what
               this whole thing's about.

                               DOLORES
               The papers said the safe door was
               opened, Eddie.

                               VALIANT
               Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya,
               Dolores?

                               BABY HERMAN
               My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always
               was after Acme's property.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?

     Valiant takes the paint chip out of his pocket and dangles it
     in front of Baby Herman.

                               BABY HERMAN
               No.  But neither does Roger.  That's
               Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise
               Orange.

                               DOLORES
               Well, I'll be...

                               BABY HERMAN
               So what's your next move, Valiant?

                               VALIANT
               My next move?  That's easy.  I'm
               gettin' up, and I'm walkin' out the
               door, and I'm goin' home to bed.

     Valiant stands.

                               DOLORES
               So you're not even gonna bother to find
               out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?

                               VALIANT
               He's a Toon... who cares?

     Baby Herman shakes his head sorrowfully.  As Valiant heads
     for the door, Dolores whaps her towel down on the bar.

                               DOLORES
               Well, you used to care, Eddie.  And it
               didn t matter if a client's skin was
               black, white, or painted!

     Valiant ignores her and walks out the door.


     INT. VALIANT'S HOUSE - DAY

     Eddie comes in the door with his coat over his shoulder.  He
     tosses the jacket over the chair and walks to the Murphy bed.
     He grabs the strap, and loosening his tie, walks away from
     the wall, pulling the bed down.  What he doesn't see is...


     ROGER RABBIT

     asleep in the bed.


     VALIANT

     still with his back to Roger, sits down exhaustedly on the
     bed and kicks off his shoes.  He lies back and pulls the
     covers over him.  He closes his eyes, rolls over to get
     comfortable.  Now he and Roger are nose-to-nose.  They both
     open their eyes at the same time.  They freak.

                               VALIANT
                      (screams)
               Aah!

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (screams)
               Aah!

     They both jump out of the bed.

                               VALIANT
               What the hell are you doin'?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I needed a place to hide.  I'm in
               trouble, Eddie.

                               VALIANT
               So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could
               get me a rap for aiding and abetting.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm
               here.

                               VALIANT
               Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my
               house?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, I asked the newsboy on the
               corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked
               a janitor, the fireman and finally the
               green grocer down the way.  He was very
               helpful.

                               VALIANT
               In other words, the whole goddamn world
               knows you're here!  Out!  Get out!

     Eddie tries to open the door, but Roger blocks it
     spider-like, arms and legs extended.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Please, Eddie, don't put me out.  I
               didn't do it, I swear.

     Valiant gives up trying to open the door and grabs Roger.  He
     pulls and he pulls.  Finally Roger snaps off like a broken
     rubber band.  The two of them go tumbling backward.  Valiant
     makes a grab for Roger but he slips out of his grasp like
     quicksilver.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               Sure I wanted to win Jessy back, but
               not that way.

     Valiant lunges again.  Roger dodges.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               After I left you, I went to see her at
               the Ink & Paint Club.

     Valiant picks himself up and tries to catch his breath.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               She was on stage, so I found a piece of
               paper and wrote her a love letter.

     Roger pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket and starts
     reading.

                                ROGER RABBIT
                       (continuing)
               'Dear Jessy.  How do I love thee?  Let
               me count the ways.  1-1000, 2-1000,
               3-1000...

     Valiant leaps for Roger and gets bim by the throat.  He rips
     the paper out of Roger's hand and crumples it up and throws
     it down.  He opens the door, throws Roger outside and quickly
     slams the door shut.  He leans against it, breathing hard.
     Suddenly, Roger comes through the mail slot like a limbo
     dancer.  Valiant, too tired to chase him, just watches him.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               Hey, that wasn't very nice.

     He retrieves the love letter, straightens it and puts it back
     in his pocket.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               It took me almost an hour to compose
               that.  But I decided not to leave it
               anyway.  I'd read it in person, that
               was my plan.

     Valiant crosses to the kitchen area where the dark room is
     still set up.  He opens the cabinet under the sink and comes
     out with a bottle of Scotch.  He takes a shot glass and pours
     himself one.

                               VALIANT
               Look, pal, if you're still here when I
               finish this drink, I'm callin' the
               police.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya.
               The police'll just dip me.  They were
               waitin' for me when I got home last
               night.  I ran.

                               VALIANT
               If you're so innocent, why'd you run?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always
               run.

     Valiant shoots the drink down and holds up the empty glass.
         
                               VALIANT
               That's it.

     He crosses to the phone on the counter.  He lifts the
     receiver and starts to dial.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, this is the moment of truth!  And
               I've spoken the truth, but you won't
               believe the truth.  So I guess the
               truth is my goose is cooked, my hash is
               slung. my fait is accompli.

     As Valiant finishes dialing, he idly puts the empty shot
     glass down on a photograph on the counter.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               Won't anything change your mind?

     Valiant turns from the pleading rabbit.  Now something he
     sees on the counter gets his attention.


     POV THROUGH SHOT GLASS

     The shot glass is resting on one of the reject pictures of
     Acme and Jessica.  The bottom of the glass is magnifying the
     back of the exuberant Marvin Acme.  Sticking out of his back
     pocket is a legal folder headed "Last Will and Testament".


     CLOSE - VALIANT

     He looks as if the truth has just hit him in the face.

                               VALIANT
               The goddamn will.

                               VOICE
                      (on phone)
               L.A.P.D.?

     Valiant slowly returns the phone to the cradle,

                               ROGER RABBIT
               You mean you believe me?

     Now outside we HEAR TIRES SCREECHING to a stop.  Roger runs
     to the window and pulls back the drapes.  His eyes bug out of
     his head.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               It's Toon Control!

     Valiant comes to the window and looks out, too.


     VALIANT'S POV

     The Toon Control wagon has stopped in front of the house.
     The Weasles pile out.  One of them takes what looks like a
     butterfly net out of the back.  Several others grab violin
     cases.


     EDDIE AND ROGER

     Valiant jerks Roger back behind the curtain.

                               VALIANT
               Get away from that window.

     Roger, elated, jumps into Valiant's arms.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               You're gonna help me?  How can I ever
               thank you?

     He plants a big wet Toon kiss on Valiant's lips.

                               VALIANT
               For starters... don't ever kiss me.


     EXT. BUNGALOW

     The Weasles are filing up the walk to the front door.  The
     leader pounds on the front door.

                               WEASLE
               Police...


     INT. BUNGALOW

     Valiant puts Roger down.

                               VALIANT
               I'll talk to 'em.  Find a place to
               hide.

     Roger zips to the closet door and goes inside.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Not in there.  That's the first place
               they'll look.

     Valiant goes to the closet and opens the door.  REVEAL Roger
     is now dressed in Eddie's trenchcoat and hat.  Playfully,
     Roger snaps one of the handcuffs onto Eddie's wrist.  He's
     got the Other attached to one of his wrists.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest!
               Just kidding...

                               VALIANT
               You idiot.  I lost the key for those
               cuffs.

     BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!  The KNOCKING is more impatient.  Valiant
     looks to the door.

                               WEASLE (O.S.)
               Open up!


     EXT. VALIANT'S DOOR

     The Weasles open the violin cases and take out real tommy guns
     and shoulder them in teams of two.  Suddenly they unleash a
     torrent of MACHINE GUN FIRE, making the outline of a weasle
     in the door with BULLETS.  The leader blows on the cut-out
     and it falls in.  The Weasles file through one by one.


     INT. APARTMENT

     The Weasles don't bother to look around.  They all just start
     BLASTING.  Bullets fly every which way.  The barrage destroys
     Valiant's apartment in a matter of seconds.  When the
     shooting stops and the smoke clears, the Weasles look around.
     The head Weasle spots blood all over the kitchen floor.

                                WEASLE #1
               We got him.

     But when he looks behind the counter, it's only a shattered
     ketchup bottle.


     EXT. REAR OF APARTMENT

     Eddie and Roger, handcuffed together, are beating it down the
     alley.  Roger, being a rabbit, is beating it a lot faster.
     He's kicking up dust, his legs are blur.  Valiant stumbles
     trying to keep up.  When they round the corner, Roger slams
     on the brakes, Toon style.  Valiant goes skidding past him and
     is jerked to a stop like a dog on a short leash.

                               VALIANT
               Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a
               Toon.

                               VALIANT
               Don't ever forget that.


     EXT. BUNGALOW - BACK WINDOW - THE WEASLES

     come piling out the window.  They start sniffing the ground.
     Suddenly one of them freezes on point, like a dog.  Another
     blows a HUNTER'S HORN and they're off on the trail.


     EXT. STREET - EDDIE AND ROGER

     emerge from the alley.  They pause momentarily to
     reconnoiter.  Eddie decides to go left, Roger right.  When
     they get to the end of the cuffs, they snap back into a pile.
     Valiant gets back to his feet and hauls Roger up angrily.

                               VALIANT
               This way, goof...

     They start across the street.  But Roger goes on one side of
     the Street sign, Eddie the other.  Roger coils around it like
     a tether ball.  Valiant yanks Roger off the sign and they
     duck across the street just as a trolley car passes.


     THE WEASLES

     come bloodhounding around the corner.  They search the street
     for signs of the fugitive.  But when they get to the trolley
     tracks, they stop, bewildered.

                               WEASLE #1
               Scent's cold.

                               WEASLE #2
               Pssst.

     He points toward the trolley car pulling into the Terminal
     Station.  They fall all over themselves scurrying over to the
     trolley.  They surround it and jump aboard, tommy-gun at the
     ready.


     INT. RED CAR

     The CONDUCTOR raises his hands like it was a hold-up.  A
     couple PASSENGERS scream as the Weasles search the car.  But
     no Roger or Eddie.  As quickly as they got on, they get off.


     EXT. RED CAR

     as it pulls away.  The Weasles look around perplexed.

                               WEASLE #1
               Funny... I could swear I smelled
               rabbit.


     ANGLE FROM ABOVE

     Eddie and Roger are balanced on the trolley wire above the
     Weasles' heads.  As the Weasles sniff around the barn, Eddie
     and Roger ease along the wire, using the wall of the Terminal
     Bar to lean on.


     INT. TERMINAL BAR - KITCHEN

     Dolores is preparing corned beef and cabbage.  The RADIO is
     PLAYING "MARES EAT OATS".  A NEWSCASTER breaks into the
     music.

                               NEWSCASTER
               News flash... Hollywood.  Citywide
               Toonhunt for Roger Rabbit, suspect in
               Acme slaying.  Police describe him as
               short, cuddly...  and psychotic.

     Dolores turns just as Roger's grinning face appears in the
     window.

                               DOLORES
                      (startled)
               Mother Mary...

     Now Eddie's face comes into view.  He motions for her to open
     the window.


     OUTSIDE THE WINDOW

     Roger and Eddie watch another trolley approach.  The contact
     arm sparks its way along the wire as it rolls along towards
     them.  Valiant watches as Dolores struggles to get the window
     open.

                               VALIANT
               Hurry, hurry...

     At the last second, the window opens.  Eddie jumps for the
     sill, Roger dangling from the cuffs as the trolley passes.


     INT. KITCHEN

     Dolores helps pull Valiant through the window.  Then he drags
     Roger inside.

                               DOLORES
               Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it
               is?

                               VALIANT
               Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.

     Roger bows at the waist, takes her hand and kisses it like
     Charles Boyer

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Charmed, enchanted, pleasure's all
               mined.

                               DOLORES
               Where'd you find him?

                               VALIANT
               The Toon Fairy left him under my
               pillow.

     Now Roger spots a plate of freshly shucked corn.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               May I?

     Before she can answer, he grabs an ear, presses it to his
     lips and applies the typewriter method to it.  When he gets
     to the end of a row, we even HEAR the BING!

                               DOLORES
               He's a riot.

                               VALIANT
               Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed
               to him.
                      (holds up
                       cuffs)
               Anybody in the back room?

                               DOLORES
               It's all yours.

     We FOLLOW Dolores as she leads Valiant and Roger across the
     hall.  She stops at a door, unlocks it, and leads them in.


     INT. BACK ROOM

     It's a tiny storage room/office with an institutional metal
     desk, a cot, and assorted janitorial supplies stacked around.
     Dolores shuts and locks the door behind her.  Valiant goes to
     a metal locker and digs through some tools, coming out with a
     hacksaw.  He sits on the cot and starts working on the cuffs.

                               DOLORES
               So you decided to help him after all?

                               VALIANT
               I oughta have my head examined.
                      (to Roger)
               Will you hold still?

     Roger quiets like a child for a moment as Valiant saws
     feverishly.  Then Roger slips his hand out of the cuff and
     holds his side while Eddie keeps sawing.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Does this help?

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, that's better.

     Valiant saws a couple more strokes before the realization of
     what Roger's done hits him.  His face darkens.  Roger sees
     the look and sheepishly tries to recover by sticking his hand
     back in the cuff.

                               VALIANT
               You mean to tell me you coulda taken
               your hand outta that cuff at any time?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, no, not any time.  Only when it
               was funny.

     Valiant looks at Roger like he's about to brain him.  Roger
     pulls his hand free again, and cowers out of range.  Valiant
     just rubs his forehead.

                               VALIANT
               Are you always this funny, or only on
               days when you're wanted for murder?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               My philosophy is if you don't have a
               sense of humor, you're better off dead.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah... well you just might get your
               wish.

                               DOLORES
               Can you get him out of it, Eddie?

                               VALIANT
               If I can find whoever wanted to kill
               Acme bad enough to get this.

     Valiant throws the pattycake picture down on the table.
     Dolores and Roger both examine it closely.

                               DOLORES
               Acme's will.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               So that's what this little drama is all
               about.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of
               the sound mind, your wife the sound
               body.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I resent that innuendo!  My wife is
               completely innocent.

                               VALIANT
               Your wife may be a lot of things, pal,
               but innocent isn't one of them.

                               DOLORES
               So what's the scam, Eddie?

                               VALIANT
               Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody
               wants Acme's property.  Cack the old
               man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the
               will.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               The habeus corpus is thickening.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't
               think they got the will.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               How do you know that?

                               VALIANT
               Well, Acme had the will in his pocket
               that night at the club.  It was gone in
               the morning when the cops found the
               body.

                               DOLORES
               Maybe they just took it out of his
               pocket.

                               VALIANT
               Then why'd they bother to crack the
               safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from
               Mount Baldy and it won't open.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your
               logic is specious.  What prevented Mr.
               Acme from putting the will back in the
               safe before they killed him?

                               VALIANT
               Because he's not forty feet tall.  The
               safe was up on the ceiling, remember?

     Dolores whistles over his deductions.

                               DOLORES
               Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow
               maybe I'll go down to probate court and
               see who's sniffin' around Acme's
               estate?

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle
               Maroon's cage.

     Valiant finishes sawing the cuffs.  He stands and throws the
     cuffs aside.  Valiant and Dolores go to the door.  Roger
     follows them eagerly.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               What should I do?  Who should I see?
               Where should I go?

     Valiant turns.

                               VALIANT
               Nothin', no one, nowhere,

     He slams the door.


     INT. POLO LOUNGE - CLOSE - MAROON

     He's in a booth in the middle of a business lunch.

                               MAROON
               Maybe money grows on trees in Toontown,
               but not at the Maroon Studio.

     WIDEN THE SHOT to REVEAL that Maroon's sharing a booth with
     BUGS BUNNY and his AGENT.  Bugs is chewing on a carrot.

                               BUGS BUNNY
               Look, Doc, fiduciary considerations
               aside, Roger Rabbit may have been
               willing to play second banana to an
               ankle-biter, but I ain't.


     ACROSS THE ROOM

     A MAITRE D' is leading Valiant and Augie, the deaf-mute to a
     table by the door.

                               VALIANT
               This'll be fine, huh, Augie?

      Augie nods his head.  They sit and pick up the menus.  Augie
      takes one peek and looks at Valiant, alarmed.  He scribbles a
      note.  Valiant reads it.

                               VALIANT
               Forget about the prices, pal.  If you
               want the shrimp cocktail, you have a
               shrimp cocktail.
                      (puts menu
                       down)
               Excuse me, Augie, I've got a little
               table-hopping to do.

      Valiant gets up from the table and starts across the room.


      AT MAROON'S BOOTH

                               AGENT
               I think you should know, R.K., we're in
               negotiations for Bugs to star in his
               own series at Warner Brothers.

                               MAROON
               Trying to scare up a bidding war
               between me and Jack Warner, eh?  Well,
               it won't work.  I'll call William
               Morris and I'll have 'em put out a
               rabbit call the likes of which this
               town's never seen!

                               BUGS BUNNY
               It's your dime, Doc.

                               MAROON
               And stop callin' me Doc!

                               BUGS BUNNY
               Eh, sure, Doc.

     Now Valiant arrives, pulls up a chair from next table and
     sits down.

                               VALIANT
               Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?

                               MAROON
               Valiant?  What're you doin' here?

                               VALIANT
               I Just thought I'd drop by and show you
               a photograph.

                               MAROON
               I've already seen your photographs.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, but I enlarged this one.  Thought
               you might be interested.

     Valiant takes an enlargement of the pattycake shot and puts
     it on the table in front of Maroon.  We can clearly see the
     will sticking out of Acme's pocket.

                               VALIANT
               Anyway... enjoy your lunch.

     Valiant stands and departs.  But his visit has done it's
     trick.  Maroon looks l'ike he's seen a ghost.  We FOLLOW
     Valiant across the room to his table where Augie is
     blissfully attacking a shrimp cocktail.

                               VALIANT
               How is that, Augie, pretty good?

     Augie nods enthusiastically.  Valiant keeps an eye on
     Maroon's booth.  Now he nudges Augie as Maroon excuses
     himself and goes into the phone booth just outside the door.
     Augie puts his shrimp fork down and picks up his pencil.


     AUGIE'S POV

     We see Maroon talk on the phone MOS.  As his lips move,
     Valiant supplies his words.

                               VALIANT (V.O.)
               It's me.  Valiant says there's a will.
               I don't know what he's trying to
               pull...


     BACK TO SCENE

     Valiant is reading of Augie's pad as Augie reads Maroon's
     lips, and scribbles down what he says.

                               VALIANT
                      (reading)
               Somebody's gonna have to take care of
               him.

     Augie looks up from his scribbling to exchange an eyebrow
     raising glance with Valiant.  Then he turns back to Maroon
     again.

                               VALIANT
                      (reading)
               The old man had it at the club that
               night.  That's right.  Yeah, I'm sure.
               I'll be there.

     Augie stops writing as Maroon hangs up the phone.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing; to
                       Augie)
               Where?

     Augie shrugs his shoulders.  Disappointed, Valiant lights a
     cigarette.  Now Augie elbows him and gestures across at
     Maroon, who's making another call.  Augie starts writing
     again.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing;
                       reading)
               Iris... cancel my appointments this
               afternoon.  I'll be at Forest Lawn.

     Maroon hangs up the phone and comes out of the phone booth.
     He hustles out of the room.  Valiant stands.

                               VALIANT
               You did great, Augie.  Have another
               shrimp cocktail.

     Valiant drops a twenty on the table and pats Augie on the
     back.


     EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL

     A CARHOP wheels a yellow Packard up in front.  Maroon climbs
     in and ROARS off.  Valiant ENTERS THE FRAME.  He looks after
     Maroon, then calmly starts walking down the driveway.


     EXT. FOREST LAWN CEMETERY - RED CAR STOP - DAY

     A Red Car pulls up.  Valiant climbs off.  He calmly crosses
     the street and ducks behind the cemetery entranceway as
     Maroon's Packard ROARS through.

                               VALIANT
                      (impressed)
               Love that Red Car.

     As Valiant starts to walk up the hill...

                                              CUT TO:


     THE ACME FUNERAL SITE - LONG SHOT - DAY

     A hearse, and a line of black limos are parked in the lane.
     Nearby, Marvin Acme's funeral is in progress.  Clustered
     around a gravesite are the mourners... TOONS of every stripe.
     There's MICKEY MOUSE comforting MINNIE.  TOM AND JERRY.
     HECKLE AND JECKLE.  CHIP 'N DALE.  Everyone from the famous
     to the not so famous is in attendance.  The eulogy is being
     delivered in a familiar blustery Southern VOICE.  It's
     FOGHORN LEGHORN.

                               FOGHORN LEGHORN
               Today we commit the body of brother
               Acme to the cold, I say cold, cold
               ground.  We shed no tears for we know
               that Marvin is going to a better place.
               That high, high, I say that
               high-larious place up in the sky.

     Foghorn Leghorn dramatically points skyward.

                               TOONS
                      (in unison)
               A-men!


     NEW ANGLE - VALIANT

     is leaning up against a palm tree on the hill.  We have been
     watching the proceedings from his POV.  Now he sees Maroon's
     car pull up.  He moves around to the other side of the tree
     as Maroon passes and starts wending his way through the
     crowd.


     AT THE GRAVESITE

     Foghorn Leghorn nods to the funeral DIRECTOR, a pasty-faced
     human in a black mourning coat.  The Director starts to turn
     the crank lowering the coffin into the grave.

                               FOGHORN LEGHORN
               Give us a sign, brother Herman, that
               you've arrived...

     Much to the funeral Director's amazement, the crank starts
     PLINKING Out the tune to "POP GOES THE WEASLE".  Now the Toon
     mourners pick up on it and join in.

                               TOONS
                      (singing)
               Round and round the mullberry bush, The
               monkey chased the weasle...

     The crank and SONG start going FASTER AND FASTER.

                               TOONS
                      (continuing;
                       singing)
               The monkey raid it all was in fun.  POP!
               Goes the weasle.

     Suddenly half of the lid to Acme's coffin flies open and a
     harlequin CLOWN BOI-YOI-YOINGS out.  The funeral Director
     faints dead away as the Toon SOBS turn to LAUGHTER.  The
     Toons turn and head away from the grave comforted by a
     funeral befitting a gag king.  They climb into their cars and
     SCREECH off like the start of the Indy 500.  One mourner is
     left at the gravesite.  Sitting in a chair dabbing at her
     eyes with a handkerchief is Jessica Rabbit.  Maroon walks up
     behind her.

                               MAROON
               So... trying to pull a fast one on me,
               huh?

     Jessica turns, startled.  She stands and faces Maroon.


     VALIANT

     smiles and leans in.  This is the moment he's been waiting
     for.  Now just as the conversation begins, it is drowned out
     by the NOISE from a LAWN MOWER.  Valiant turns to see a
     GARDENER riding around on a small tractor cutting the grass.
     Valiant tries to flag him down as he watches Maroon and
     Jessica having an arguement.  There's accusatory finger
     pointing.  In pantomime, Maroon gestures into his pocket as
     if describing the position of Acme's will.

     Jessica tries to leave.  He grabs her arm.  They're screaming
     at each other but we don't hear a word.  Valiant waves
     frantically for the Gardener to cut the machine.  But the
     Gardener misconstrues it as a friendly greeting and waves
     back.  Valiant turns in time to see Jessica kick Maroon in
     the groin and stomp off to a red Auburn Speedster.  She jumps
     in and speeds away as Maroon staggers back to his car.  The
     Gardener stops the tractor next to Valiant.  He SHUTS OFF THE
     ENGINE.  The cemetery is completely still again.

                               GARDENER
               Somethin' you want, mister?

                               VALIANT
               Not anymore...


     EXT. INK & PAINT CLUB - ALLEY - NIGHT

     A Steinway piano truck is parked next to the stage door.  TWO
     husky PIANO MOVERS are rolling a baby grand up the ramp to
     the stage door.  They knock on the door.  The Gorilla opens
     it and they muscle the piano inside.  After a moment, they
     reemerge.  We FOLLOW them back to the truck where a second
     baby grand stands ready to be moved.

                               MOVER #1
               I don't know about you, but it makes me
               sick to think of these beautiful pianos
               gettin' chopped into match sticks every
               night by those screwy ducks.

     Struggling, they push this second piano into the club.


     INT. CLUB - BACKSTAGE

     They roll the piano over to the wall and park it next to the
     first.

                               MOVER #2
                      (shakes head)
               And they call it entertainment.

     As they go out the stage door, MOVE IN on the baby grand.


     INSIDE THE PIANO - VALIANT

     is lying prone -- using the Steinway as his own Trojan Horse.
     He lifts the piano lid to climb out, but then HEARS FOOTSTEPS
     approaching.  He lowers the lid again.  Now someone starts
     testing the keys.  We see the hammers strike the strings,
     RUNNING UP THE SCALES until they reach the one under
     Valiant's nose.  The hammer whacks Valiant's nose on the
     backswing and strikes the string making a terrible SOUR NOTE.

                               DONALD DUCK (V.O.)
                      (exasperated
                       QUACK)
               Phooey!  Out of tune again!

                               DAFFY DUCK (V.O.)
               Not to worry, Donald.  We can fix that
               with my sledgehammer.

                               DONALD DUCK (V.O.)
               Never mind, Daffy.  I've got an axe in
               my dressing room.

     Valiant's eyes widen.


     ANGLE ON PIANO

     as the VOICES of Daffy and Donald recede, Valiant raises the
     lid and quickly climbs out.  He eases over to Jessica's
     dressing room.  As he starts to open the door, he HEARS
     SCUFFLING from inside.  Valiant puts his ear to the door.
     More SCUFFLING.  Valiant straightens, then suddenly whips the
     door open and flicks on the light.


     INT. DRESSING ROOM

     Nobody's there.  Perplexed, Valiant closes the door behind
     him and checks behind the dressing screen.  In the closet.
     No one.  He shrugs and starts to search the room.  He goes to
     Jessica's dressing table and rifles the drawers.  In her
     purse he discovers a Toon revolver.  He examines it.

                               VALIANT
               Girl's gotta protect herself.

     Valiant puts the gun back in the purse and closes the drawer.
     As he stands, he pauses to consider a Hurrel-like
     black-and-white photo of Roger Rabbit in a silver deco frame.
     He's dramatically posed with a cigarette like he was Tyrone
     Power.

     Valiant shakes his head and turns from the table.  Something
     catches his eye.


     ANGLE ON FLOOR

     Behind the dressing table, the corner of a piece of blue
     paper peeks out.  Valiant stoops down and fishes it out.
     It's a cover for a legal document -- "Last Will and Testament
     -- Marvin Acme".


     VALIANT

     stands, pleased.  He opens the blue folder.  But it's empty.
     Valiant puts it in his inside pocket and turns to go when
     suddenly an unseen hand flicks the lights off.

                               VALIANT
               Son of a bitch...

     We can't see anything in the darkness.  But we hear the SOUND
     of A FISTFIGHT.  There's the CRASHING of lamps and furniture
     breaking.  Now the door opens for a second as the assailant
     escapes.  Light floods in the room, illuminating Valiant on
     the floor with a curtain wrapped around his head.  As he
     struggles free the door closes.  The room is dark again.
     Valiant scrambles to the door.  When he whips it open, REVEAL
     the Gorilla framed in the doorway.  Valiant is frozen.  The
     Gorilla flicks on the light.  He smiles wickedly.

                               GORILLA
               And here I tought we had mice.

     Valiant tries to make a break for it.  WHAM!  The Gorilla
     lays him out cold with a right cross.

                                              BLACKOUT.


     FADE IN:

     VALIANT'S POV FROM FLOOR

     As his vision comes INTO FOCUS, Valiant sees the Gorilla,
     Jessica Rabbit, the Weasles and Judge Doom are standing over
     him.

                               GORILLA
               ... I caught him rummagin' around in
               here.  Then I called you, Judge, on a
               counta you be da one we pay juice to.

                               DOOM
                      (clears throat)
               You did the right thing, Bongo.


     THE WEASLES

     pull a groggy Valiant upright and plop him in a chair in
     front of Doom.

                               DOOM
               Being caught breaking and entering is
               not very good advertising for a
               detective.  What were you looking for,
               Mr. Valiant?

                               VALIANT
               Ask her...

     Valiant nods toward Jessica, who stands coolly smoking a
     cigarette.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Last week some heavy breather wanted
               one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe
               that's what he was after?

                               VALIANT
               Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I
               woulda broken into Frederick's of
               Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin
               Acme's will.

                               DOOM
               Marvin Acme had no will.  I should
               know, the probate is in my court.

                               VALIANT
               He had a will, all right.  She took it
               off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon
               knocked him off.  Then she set up her
               loving husband to take the fall.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               You, Mr. Valiant, are either drunk or
               punch drunk.  Probably both.

                               DOOM
               These are bold accusations, Mr.
               Valiant.  I hope you have some proof?

                               VALIANT
               I found the cover the will came in
               behind the dressing table.

     Valiant reaches into his pocket.  But the blue envelope is
     gone.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               They must've taken it off me.

                               DOOM
               They?

                               VALIANT
               The other people who were in here
               lookin' for the will.  I woulda caught
               'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted
               me.

     The Gorilla makes a move for Valiant.  Doom stops him.

                               DOOM
               Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr.
               Valiant our own way... downtown.

                               VALIANT
               Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of
               Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk
               to him.

                               DOOM
               Oh, not that downtown.  Toontown.

     The mention of Toontown has a visible impact on Valiant.

                               VALIANT
                      (nervous)
               You're not takin' me to downtown
               Toontown?

                               DOOM
               Indeed we are.  We'll continue the
               interrogation there.

                               VALIANT
                      (very agitated)
               I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me
               Santino.

                               DOOM
               You're a very stubborn man, Mr.
               Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show
               Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed
               men at the Toontown station...

     As the Weasles drag Valiant out of the room...

                               VALIANT
                      (screaming)
               No... you bastards!  Leggo of me!


     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     The Toon Control Wagon streaks along with the cat SIREN
     WAILING.  It flashes by then slams on the brakes at the
     entrance to an eerie tunnel.  A sign next to the tunnel says:
     "Toontown".


     INT. WAGON

     The Weasles look over at the bound and gagged Valiant.  One
     of them turns Valiant's head to look at the Toontown sign.

                               WEASLE #1
               What're you shakin' for?  Didn't you
               have a good time last time you were
               here?

     With a wicked WHEEZE, the driver floors it.


     EXT. TUNNEL

     The wagon disappears into the murky darkness.  PAN UP to the
     night sky.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:


     THE SKY - MORNING

     PAN DOWN to the tunnel.  We can't see into the darkness but
     we HEAR HOOTING and HOLLERING from within.  GUNS going off,
     FIRECRACKERS EXPLODING, WHIPS CRACKING, all accompanied by
     the WHEEZING LAUGHTER of the Weasles.

                               WEASLE #1 (O.S.)
               Soo-eey!  Soo-eey!

                               WEASLE #2 (O.S.)
               Let him go, boys.  I think he's got the
               message.

     After a beat, Valiant comes staggering out of the tunnel.
     He's got a burlap sack over his head tied around his waist.
     Behind him, the Weasles emerge holding paint cans and
     brushes.  They watch as he trips and falls by the side of the
     road.  The Weasles GIGGLE victoriously and head back inside.
     Valiant lies there for a moment, catching his breath.  Then
     he struggles to free his hands.  Finally he rips the sack off
     his head and sits up.


     CLOSE - VALIANT

     We see he's got a huge Toon pig with a goofy grin painted
     over his head.  Valiant pulls and tugs on it, but this is a
     costume that won't come off.  Valiant curses, gets to his
     feet and stumbles down the road.


     EXT. RED CAR STOP

     Valiant gets in the back of the line of PASSENGERS boarding
     the Red Car.


     INT. RED CAR - VALIANT

     steps aboard.  The Trolleyman, who we recognize as Earl from
     the Terminal bar, does a double-take when he sees the
     ridiculously silly looking man/Toon.

                               EARL
               Here's one for the books... a Toon
               wearin' human clothes.

                               VALIANT
               Earl... it's me, Valiant.

                               EARL
               Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?

                               VALIANT
               Toon cops worked me over.

                               EARL
               Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real
               Toon-a-Roo.

                               VALIANT
                      (apprehensively)
               What am I, Earl?

     Earl breaks the news to Valiant soberly.

                               EARL
               You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.

                               VALIANT
               No...

                               EARL
               Does it hurt?

                               VALIANT
               Not much.  It's hard to talk.

                               EARL
               Uh, Eddie, do me a favor.  Could you
               sit in the back so you won't cause as
               much of a commotion.

     Valiant tries to pull the brim of his hat down.  But it's
     comically small on the huge head.  He makes his way down the
     aisle past a veritable gauntlet of RAZZING, poking, tripping
     PASSENGERS.  Finally he finds an empty seat in the back as
     the Red Car starts up.


     A LITTLE KID

     wearing a baseball cap is sitting a few seats away with his
     MOTHER.  The Kid looks back at Eddie and laughs.  He leans
     over and whispers something to his Mom.

                               KID
               Can I, Mom?

                               MOMMY
               Go ahead, darling.  Take your bat.

     The Kid takes his baseball bat and approaches Valiant
     innocently.

                               KID
               Hi, Mr. Pig.  If I hit you on the head,
               will you make me a cuckoo bird?

     The Kid starts to take a swing with the bat.

                               VALIANT
               Kid, if you hit me on the head, I'm
               gonna throw you out this window.

     The Kid's eyes widen in terror.  This is not a typical Toon
     response.

                               KID
                      (crying)
                Mommy!


     INT. VALIANT'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

     We hear the SOUND of the SHOWER.  Valiant's hand reaches out
     past the shower curtain and grabs for a bottle.  But it's not
     shampoo.  It's turpentine.

                               VALIANT (O.S.)
               Dammit!

     CLOSE - TUB DRAIN

     The water swirling down the drain is tinged with paint of
     different colors.


     CLOSE - VALIANT

     He scrubs manically until the last of the pig head is gone.
     He rinses off and he feels around his face.  The absence of
     the Toon mask seems to bring him some relief.  He shuts off
     the shower and slides the shower curtain back.


     VALIANT'S POV - JESSICA RABBIT

     is leaning up against the doorjamb, dressed as usual, in a
     black cocktail dress with elbow length gloves and pearls.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the
               doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear
               it.

                               VALIANT
               That's because I don't have a doorbell.

     Jessica, caught in her lie, flutters her eyelids nervously.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.

                               VALIANT
               Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a
               towel.

     As she hands him a towel, she stares down at his anatomy.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               What's that thing?

     Valiant looks down at what she's referring to.

                               VALIANT
               Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a
               mole before?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Toons aren't given imperfections.

                               VALIANT
               No?  I guess we're not counting lying,
               stealing and murder.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               You've got the wrong idea about me.
               I'a a pawn in this just like poor
               Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll
               pay you anything.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta
               have the rabbit to make the scam work.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               No, no, no... I love my husband.

                               VALIANT
               Oh, sure.  I can just feature you
               standin' outside your little hutch,
               holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby
               to come home.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr,
               Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is
               being a woman looking the way I do.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it
               is bein' a man looking at a woman
               looking the way you do.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.

                               VALIANT
               I'm not complainin'.  But give me
               credit.  I'm the guy who took the
               pictures of you and Acme playin'
               pattycake, remember?

     Jessica takes a cigarette out of her purse.  She lights it
     and blows a cloud of Toon smoke.  It forms a recreation of
     what she describes.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Maroon came to me.  He told me he'd
               fire Roger if I didn't do it.  I went
               along with him for Roger's sake.  It
               was only pattycake, after all.

     Valiant waves at the smoke scene, dispelling it.

                               VALIANT
               So altruistic.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               It's the truth.  Why won't you believe
               it?

                               VALIANT
               Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I
               don't know what you're up to, lady, but
               I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               If I'm as bad as you think, what's
               stopping me from just killing you right
               now?

     Valiant reaches behind him and picks up a small cup on the
     sink.

                               VALIANT
               This cup of turpentine right here.  Go
               for that gun in your purse and I'm
               gonna let you have it.

     Jessica breaks down and starts sobbing.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Oh, Mr, Valiant, please... you're my
               only hope.

     She comes to Eddie and hugs him, burying her head in his
     shoulder.

                                JESSICA RABBIT
               I'm weak... you're strong.  Can't you
               find a place somewhere in your heart to
               help me?

     Valiant looks down at the luscious creature in his arms,
     considering the request.  The moment is interrupted by the
     CLEARING of a VOICE.

                               DOLORES (O.C.)
               Dabblin' in watercolors, Eddie?

     Valiant, still in just a towel, sheepishly turns to face
     Dolores, who's standing in the doorway.

                               VALIANT
               Dolores...

     Dolores regards Jessica with undisguised contempt.

                               DOLORES
               Lemme guess... your cousin from Des
               Moines?

     Jessica straightens her dress.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Perhaps I should go.

                               DOLORES
               Must you?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Goodbye, Eddie... don't hate me.

     Jessica blows Eddie a TOON KISS which flies across the room,
     landing on Eddie's cheek.  She saunters past the smoldering
     Dolores and out the door.  Dolores walks to Eddie and peels
     the kiss off his cheek.  She crumples it up and throws it
     down in the wastebasket.

                               DOLORES
               What was that?

                               VALIANT
               That was the rabbit's wife.

                               DOLORES
               The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what
               she was doin' with her arms around you?

                               VALIANT
               Probably lookin' for a good place to
               stick a knife.

                               DOLORES
               I just stopped by to tell you that I
               checked out the Acme probate.

                               VALIANT
               Maroon, right?

                               DOLORES
               Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit
               again.

                               VALIANT
                      (startled)
               What the hell would they want with a
               gag factory?

                               DOLORES
               Got me.  But unless the will shows up
               by Friday midnight, it's theirs.

     As Valiant considers this new development, he cocks an ear.
     In the distance, we HEAR FAINT SINGING.

                               VALIANT
               What's that comin' from the bar?

                               DOLORES
                      (listens)
               Sounds like singin'.

                               VALIANT
               Oh, no...

     As Valiant grabs his pants...

                                              CUT TO:


     INT. TERMINAL BAR - DAY

     Roger's out all right.  In fact, he's using the bar as a
     stage for a song and dance number.  The tune is extremely
     familiar.  In fact, it's the one that opens every Warner
     Brothers cartoon...  The Looney Tune Anthem.  But we've never
     heard words to go with it.

                               ROGER RAB3IT
               'The merry-go-round broke down
               But you don't see me frown...'

     Roger grabs Augie's pad and pencil, scribbles some drawings
     lightning fast.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               'Things turned out fine
               And now she's mine...'

     Roger flips through the pad which in crude animation, shows
     the story of Roger and Jessica getting back together,
     culminating in them kissing in a heart.  Augie's delighted.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               '... Cause the merry-go-round
               Went round...
               Hoo-hoo, Hoo-hoo...'

     Roger does backflips and acts like an escapee from the acute
     ward.


     THE DOOR OPENS

     Eddie and Dolores enter.  Valiant stops in his tracks at the
     sight of Roger's performance... and the smiles on the faces
     of the sourpusses.


     CLOSE - ROGER

     doesn't see Eddie.  He moves into the next verse.  He twirls
     around on the post.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               'My name is Roger Rabbit
               I've got a crazy habit
               I like to sing and dance and yuk...'

     Roger goes to Angelo, lifts off his cap, and whacks his
     toupee, making it spin like a top.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               '... So brighten up and smile
               You schmuck'.

     All the regulars in the bar have a good laugh at that one.
     Now as Roger twirls around on the post, he smashes into a bar
     tray held by Eddie.  Valiant carries him toward the back
     room, but the irrepressable entertainer gets on his knees Al
     Jolson style and blows kisses to his audience.  The regulars
     are HOWLING as Roger is carried out.


     INT. BACK ROOM

     Valiant flings Roger into the room and slams the door behind
     him.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hey, don't I get an encore?

                               VALIANT
               Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out
               there riskin' my neck for you.   I come
               back here and you're singin' and
               dancin'.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               But that's my calling, my purpose, my
               raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to
               make people laugh... and believe me,
               those people needed a laugh.

                               VALIANT
               And when they're done laughin' , they're
               gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo
               would rat on you for a nickel!

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...

                               VALIANT
               An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He
               just got outta prison.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well... I still don't think he'd turn
               me in.

                               VALIANT
               Just because you got 'em to laugh?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie.
               Sometimes it's the only weapon we have
               in life.

                               VALIANT
               I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson
               variety.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I've met some cynical and miserable
               humans in my time.  But you, Edward
               Valiant, are positively funereal!

                               VALIANT
               Well, right now it's gonna be your
               funereal.

     Valiant takes his fist back to belt Roger.  Roger stands
     stoicly, jaw thrust forward, eyes closed.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Go ahead and throw that punch.
                      (opens one eye)
               But you'd be more successful with a
               punch line.

     Valiant drops his fist and rubs his temples with frustration.

                               VALIANT
               You're driving me crazy, you know that?
               Let's go... you ruined this as a hiding
               place.

     Valiant grabs Roger by the scruff of the neck and opens the
     door.  But he ducks back in quickly.


     VALIANT'S POW - THROUGH DOOR - JUDGE DOOM

     has entered the bar.  He stands FRAMED in the doorway,
     Voltaire perched on his shoulder.  The red light of the neon
     sign flashes on his glasses making him look like he's got
     burning coals for eyes.  With the Weasles at the door backing
     him up, the satanic Doom walks to the bar, his FOOTSTEPS
     CREAKING along the wooden floor.  He surveys the scene, leans
     over the bar for a glass.  Doom holds the glass up to the
     light and looks at it disgustedly.  He picks up a bottle of
     scotch and carries it down to where the one-armed Soldier is
     sitting.  Doom stares at him, then pulls the empty sleeve out
     of the amputee's pocket.  He uses it to wipe the inside of
     the glass.

                               DOOM
               I'm looking for a rabbit.  He was last
               seen in this neighborhood.

     The barflies avoid Doom's stare and shoot covered glances to
     one another.  But nobody says a word.  Doom pours a drink
     into his newly cleaned glass... then gently pours it down
     Voltaire's gullet.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               You couldn't miss him.  Buck teeth.
               Orange pants.  About yea big.

     Doom squashes the Midget's head down to approximate the size.

                               DOLORES
               There's no rabbit here, so don't harass
               my customers.

     Doom turns to Dolores.

                               DOOM
               I didn't come here to harass.  I came
               here to reward.

     Doom walks around Dolores toward the back.  But Doom stops
     next to the blackboard.  On it is written:  "Today's Special
     - French Dip - $ .50".  Doom erases the "French" and the
     decimal point in front of the "50".  Then he picks up the
     chalk and starts to write.  The CHALK SQUEAKS excruciatingly
     on the blackboard.  Everyone winces but watches anyway, as
     Doom writes "Rabbit" where the "French" was, and adds the
     zeroes to the "50".  It now reads:  "Rabbit Dip - $5000".


     AT THE BAR - ALL EYES

     are fixed on the figure on the blackboard.  Angelo licks his
     lips.

                               ANGELO
               Hey, I seen a rabbit...

     Angelo looks defensively at all his cronies and back to Doom.

                               ANGELO
                      (continuing)
               He's right here in the bar.

     But instead of pointing to the back of the bar, he talks to
     the empty barstool beside him.

                               ANGELO
                      (continuing)
               Say 'ello, Harvey.

     The tension is broken.  Everybody at the bar starts HOWLING.


     INT. BACK ROOM

     Roger turns to Eddie victoriously.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               My pal.


     IN THE BAR

     Doom stares down the regulars until the laughter stops.
     Meanwhile, a Weasle has started sniffing around the bar where
     Roger was dancing.  As Doom turns to leave, the Weasle
     whispers in his ear as he points to the back.  Doom smiles
     and pats the Weasle on the head.  He turns to Angelo and the
     others.

                                        DOOM
                Now we'll see who laughs best...

     The Weasle bloodhounds through the bar with Doom striding
     after him.  We FOLLOW them to the door to the back room.
     Doom rips the door open.


     INT. BACK ROON

     It's dark.  Doom flicks on the light.  REVEAL Valiant on the
     cot, his pint bottle cradled in his arm.  He blinks as if
     awakened from a drunken slumber.

                               DOOM
               Valiant?  Why is it that whenever my
               men smell a rabbit, you're there?

     Valiant plumps the pillow behind his head.

                               VALIANT
               Must be my cologne... Eau Dc Carrot.

                               WEASLE #1
                      (sniffs)
               He's in here all right, boss.

     Suddenly the Weasle grabs the pillow from under Valiant's
     head and carves it to shreds with a switchblade.  Feathers
     fly.  But no rabbit fur.

                               WEASLE #2
               Youse want we should take the place
               apart?

     The rest of the Weasles are arrayed behind Doom with Toon
     crowbars, picks, and a jackhammer.

                               DOOM
               No, Sergeant.  That won't be necessary.

     Doom walks over to the locker.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               I know a trick that no Toon can resist.

     Doom raps on the locker with his knuckles.  Da-da-da-da-da...
     It's a familiar pattern that demands a Da-da response.  Doom
     moves to the desk and tries it again.  Da-da-da-da-da...


     INSIDE A MAXWELL HOUSE COFFEE CAN

     Roger is hiding while sweating out the urge to finish the
     familiar coda.  We HEAR the RAPPING again, closer.
     Da-da-da-da-da...  Roger's biting his nails.


     DOOM

     moves to the milk crate the coffee can is on.  Valiant gets
     up off the cot.

                               VALIANT
               You know, Doom, I don't know who's
               Toonier, you or the rabbit.

     Doom just smiles and knocks the pattern out on the crate.

                               DOOM
               Shave... and... a haircut...

     Roger bursts out of the can with the lid on his head.  He
     responds con brio.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Two... bits!
                      (looks around)
               Uh... oh...

     PSSSHEW!  Roger flies out the door.


     INT. THE BAR

     He streaks across the bar and out the front door.   After a
     beat, two Weasles step into the bar holding the butterfly net
     they had stretched across the door.  They WHEEZE with glee at
     the struggling Roger trapped inside.  A third Weasle carries
     the Judge's briefcase.

     Doom strides confidently into the bar.

                               WEASLE
               Oyez... oyez... oyez... court is now in
               session.

     Valiant and Dolores are led out by a couple Weasles holding
     guns on them.  As Doom snaps the briefcase open on the bar,
     the twelve Kangaroos pop up in their jury box.  Doom raps on
     the bar with his gavel-headed cane.  The regulars watch the
     bizarre scene in stunned silence.

                               DOOM
               Roger Rabbit is charged with the cold
               blooded murder of a human... Marvin
               Acme.  The jury will direct their
               attention to exhibits A, B, and C.

     The Weasles display photographs of Jessica and Acme playing
     pattycake, a blow-up of his fingerprints spelling
     RogerRabbitRogerRabbit in the whorls on the photographs, and
     a picture of Acme lying under the safe.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Motive, evidence, modus operandi.  How
               do you find the defendant?

     Once again the Kangaroo court wastes no time delivering the
     verdict.  The Baby Kangaroos pop up with their Y-O-U A-R-E
     G-U-I-L-T-Y signs.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Guilty as charged.  Case closed!

     Doom slams the briefcase shut.  Now two Weasles wheel the
     stainless steel tub filled with dip into the bar.  Another
     hands Doom his black rubber gloves.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               For this heinous crime, I sentence you
               to the dip!

                               ROGER RABBIT
               No, no. not the dip!  Eddie, tell him
               I didn't do it!

                               VALIANT
               I don't think it's gonna matter.
               Sorry, pal, I tried.

                               DOOM
               Yes, and for that you're charged with
               aiding and abetting.  But we'll let
               Santino handle that.

     Doom pulls on the rubber gloves.

                               VALIANT
               Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last
               request?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs?
               Just kidding.

                               VALIANT
               I think you want a drink.
                      (to Doom)
               How about it, Judge?

                               DOOM
               Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous
               tonight.  The successful conclusion of
               this case draws the curtain on my
               career as a jurist. I'm retiring to
               take a new role in the private sector.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to
               give you a gold watch.

     Valiant pours a glass of whiskey filling it all the way to
     the rim.  He holds it out to Roger.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper
               for me.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               But, Eddie, you know what happens
               when...

                               VALIANT
               Drink it, jerk.  All of it.

     He grabs Roger's hand and forces the drink into it.  Roger
     shrugs his shoulders and shoots the drink down.  We've seen
     the reaction before.  Suddenly Roger's head turns into a
     STEAM WHISTLE emitting such a PIERCING BLAST that is sends
     everyone into ear-grabbing agony.  Glasses, bottles, mirrors,
     even Doom's glasses SHATTER.  Valiant uses the distraction to
     punch the Weasles holding Roger.  He grabs the rabbit by the
     scruff of the neck. He gets as assist from Augie, who
     couldn't hear the noise.  Unfazed, Augie whacks a Weasle on
     the head with a barstool.  The Midget crawls behind Doom,
     who's been momentarily blinded.  The one-armed Soldier pushes
     him over.  Angelo is turning one Weasle's head around and
     around like a cruller.  Finally, Doom gets to his feet.

                               DOOM
               After them you fools...

     As the Weasles regroup, Valiant tips the stainless steel tub
     over sending the dip spilling toward them.  The Weasles
     recoil from the liquid.  Even Doom takes a step backward.


     EXT. TERMINAL BAR

     Eddie and Roger race down the stairs and toward the Toon
     Control Wagon which is parked in front of Doom's Lincoln,

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'.
               Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the
               noodle, the grey matter...

                               VALIANT
               If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin'
               from the law with a Toon?

     Valiant opens the door of the Toon Control wagon, and flings
     Roger inside roughly.


     INT. CAB

     Eddie goes to start the vehicle but the key is gone.   Now
     from behind them comes a DEEP RUMBLING VOICE somewhere
     between Lord Buckley and Barry White.

                               VOICE
               Excuse me, gentlemen...

     Eddie and Roger turn.  A snazzy TOON ROADSTER whose grill
     functions as it's mouth is talking from behind the liquid
     bars.

                               ROADSTER
                   If you effect my extrication, I
                   could offer you some carburetion.

     Valiant sighs with resignation and slides out of the cab,
     Roger in tow.


     EXT. REAR OF WAGON

     Eddie and Roger come racing around the side of the wagon.
     Valiant searches the back of the truck for the on/off switch.
     He finds it and turns off the flow of acetone.  The Roadster
     zips out of the truck and lands on the pavement, already
     flexing and limbering.   Behind him, a comical number of other
     TOON DETAINEES hop out like midgets out of a Volkswagon.

     They all head for the hills.

                               ROADSTER
               Well... what're we waitin' for, the
               William Tell Overture?


     ANGLE ON TERMINAL BAR - THE WEASLES

     come piling out.  They stack up like an Indian totem pole
     searching every direction.  One of them spots Eddie and
     Roger.  The Weasles stumble all over themselves in a mad
     scramble down the stairs.


     EDDIE AND ROGER

     hop into the sleek two-seater.   Valiant looks at the myriad
     of goofy cartoon gauges and switches on the Roadster's
     dashboard.

                               VALIANT
               What do I do?

                               ROADSTER
               You don't have to do nothin'...

     With a ferocious RUBBER BURNING SQUEAL, the Roadster ROARS
     off in "no frames".  The exit is so fast that Eddie and Roger
     are left behind, hanging mid-air.  But before they hit the
     ground, the Roadster zips back INTO FRAME.  Eddie and Roger
     fall back into their seats.  The Roadster bends around so his
     grill is facing them.

                               ROADSTER
                      (continuing)
               Uh... except hang onto your hat.

     The Roadster ROARS off again in a cloud of Toon dust.


     INT. SANTINO'S COP CAR

     coming the other way.  It's followed by another squad car,
     both with SIRENS BLARING.  When the red blur streaks by, Lt.
     Santino turns to his PARTNER.

                               LT. SANTINO
               What the hell was that?

                               PARTNER
               Speeding rabbit, Lieutenant.

                               LT. SANTINO
               That's what I was afraid of.


     EXT. STREET

     Santino's car does a 180 degree spin, and goes after the
     Roadster.  The second squad car follows.  The Weasles pile
     into the Toon Control wagon and join the chase.


     INT. THE ROADSTER

     rockets down the street, then takes a turn so wide that it
     drives up the front of the corner building, then back down on
     the sidewalk, just avoiding a newsstand.  The squad car
     following is not so dexterous.   It CRASHES into the stand,
     sending newspapers flying.


     THE ROADSTER

     looks back over it's shoulder, admiring his handiwork.

                               ROADSTER
               Read all about it, Benny's back in
               town!

     Up ahead, an egg delivery truck is double-parked in their
     lane.  Benny snaps around just as they're about to crash into
     the back of the truck.  There's nowhere to go.   But Benny's
     cool.

                               ROADSTER
               Going up...

     Suddenly, just before impact, the Toon suspension on the car
     accordions up, giving it a clearance of about fifteen feet...
     just enough to get over the truck.


     THE TOON CONTROL WAGON

     doesn't come with this unique feature.  It tries to avoid the
     truck but SMASHES into the back, splattering hundreds of eggs
     and sending the Weasles flying.


     EDDIE AND ROGER

     look down from their suspended position at the chaos behind.

                               ROADSTER
               Next floor, sundries, knick knacks,
               escaped convicts.  Watch your step.

     The Roadster accordions back down to it's original height and
     speeds past TWO MOTORCYCLE COPS.  The motorcycles ROAR after
     them.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hey, Benny, what were you in for?

                               ROADSTER
               Reckless driving.  Do you believe that?

                               VALIANT
               Hard to imagine.

     Benny zig-zags through traffic, scooting between cars, but
     the Motorcycle Cops manage to stay on his tail.  Up ahead,
     traffic is stopped in his lane.  With nowhere to go, Benny
     passes a trolley car moving down the center of the street.
     Suddenly, he swerves in front of the trolley to elude the
     Cops... only to see another Red Car coming the other way.

                               ROADSTER
               Hold your breath, babies...

     Benny sucks in his girth and gets on his tip-toes as the
     trollies pass on either side of them.


     WIDE SHOT

     When the trollies clear, Benny staggers out from between them
     still on tip-toes.  Benny plops down, squashes, then pops up
     to his old self again.


     BEHIND THEM

     The crippled Toon Control wagon is struggling to keep up.
     Voltaire circles above the truck and picks two Weasles up off
     the roof.  They're each carrying several sticks of dynamite.


     FROM THE AIR

     We see Voltaire flying after the Roadster, which is speeding
     along the palm-lined Elysian Park Drive.  The Weasles light
     the dynamite sticks and with WHEEZING delight, bombard the
     car below.


     BENNY

     swerves right and left dodging the EXPLOSIONS.  Now a stick
     of dynamite falls into the back seat, fuse burning.  Benny
     looks back.

                               ROADSTER
               Hate to sound like Chicken Little, but
               is the sky falling or what?

     Eddie and Roger turn to see the dynamite, fuse burning low.
     Valiant makes a desperate grab for it.  But it rolls under
     the front seat.  Roger jumps in Eddie's lap.


     ABOVE - VOLTAIRE AND THE WEASLES

     satisfied that they've hit their target, swoop back to the
     Toon Control wagon.


     IN THE ROADSTER

     Valiant tries to untangle himself from Roger.

                               VALIANT
               Grab it, you idiot!

     Finally, at the last second, Roger reaches down and picks the
     dynamite up like a hot potato.  He flips it out of the
     Roadster.


     THE DYNAMITE

     spins through the air, finally landing on the roof just as
     Voltaire and the Weasles arrive.  BOOM!  The Toon Control
     wagon is demolished.  When the smoke clears we see the
     Weasles and Voltaire scattered roadside, faces blackened,
     feathers smoking.


     EXT. ECHO PARK STREET

     Benny is leading a merry chase up and down the hills.  Beside
     the two Motorcycles, there are half a dozen squad cars.  But
     as Benny comes over the last rise, we see the road deadends
     at Echo Park Lake.  The police have blocked off the
     perpendicular streets with squad cars.  Eddie and Roger see
     the deadend fast approaching.  Roger covers his eyes with his
     ears.  Valiant braces himself.

                               VALIANT
               The brakes!  The brakes!

     Benny hits the brakes.  Smoke pours out as they burn up and
     the momentum is barely broken.

                               ROADSTER
               Forget the brakes, who brought the
               water wings?

     The Roadster SMASHES through the wooden guard rail and sails
     out over the water.  KERPLOP!  It splashes down in the lake.


     THE POLICE CARS

     SCREECH to a stop at the edge of the lake.  Santino jumps out
     and regards the floating Roadster.  He turns to the other
     cops with a smirk.  When he turns back again, the smirk
     disappears from his face.


     ANGLE ON LAKE

     Benny is calmly swimming away using his fenders to do the
     crawl.  Now they pass a spooning COUPLE in a rowboat.  The
     couple regard them open-mouthed.


     THE EDGE OF THE LAKE

     Benny nears the shoreline, touches bottom and wades out.
     When they hit dry land, Benny shakes off like a dog.  He REVS
     HIS ENGINE.

                               ROADSTER
               Maybe it's my imagination, but I always
               seem to run better after I've had a
               wash.
                     (turns)
               Now where can I drop you cats?

     As Benny ROARS off...

                                              CUT TO:


     EXT. ALLEY - DAY

     Benny peeks around the corner, then tip-toes into view. down
     the alley until he stops in front of a back door.  Eddie and
     Roger climb out.

                               VALIANT
               Thanks, Benny.

                               ROADSTER
               If you ever need me, just stick out
               your thumb.

     WHOOSH!  Benny is gone.  Valiant goes to the door and unlocks
     it.  As he and Roger head up the back stairs...

                                              CUT TO:


     INT. BUILDING - CLOSE - DOORWAY

     A hand painted design on the rippled glass shows a knight on
     a white charger.  On the shield in bold letters it says,
     "Veritas".  And lettered around it -- "Valiant and Valiant -
     Private Investigation".


     VALIANT

     sticks his key in the door and unlocks it.  Roger studies the
     banner.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other
                Valiant?

                               VALIANT
                My brother.  Get inside.

     He pushes Roger into the office.


     INT. OFFICE

     It's a typical detective office -- a couch, a sink, a window
     -- except for the partner's desk in the middle of the room.
     There's a chair on each side.  Valiant closes the door and
     locks it.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                So what's our plan, our scenario, our
                modus operandi?

                               VALIANT
                We can't do anything till it's dark.

     Valiant picks up some yellowed newspapers off the couch and
     dumps them on the floor.  They leave a clean spot on the
     couch.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Guess you haven't been here in a while.
                     (reads
                      headline)
                'Japs Bomb Pearl Harbor'.

     Roger walks over to the wall.  He takes a framed picture off
     the wall which shows two guys clowning with Mickey Mouse.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Say, who's this guy laughin'?

                               VALIANT
                Me.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've
                never seen you laugh before.  That your
                brother makin' the rabbit ears?

                               VALIANT
                What is this, Twenty Questions?

     Valiant grabs the picture from Roger and re-hangs it.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
                I'm gonna get some sleep.  I suggest
                you do the same.
         
     Valiant stretches out on the couch.  Roger nudges him to move
     over so he can lie down.  Grudgingly, Valiant slides over a
     fraction giving Roger a tiny piece of the couch.  They lie
     head to foot.


     CLOSEUP - VALIANT

     The problems of the day are knitting his brow.  Finally his
     eyes close.  After a beat, we HEAR Roger SNORING.  It's LOUD.
     Valiant's eyes pop open.  He rolls over.  WIDEN THE SHOT to
     see what he sees.


     ABOVE ROGER'S HEAD - A TOON DREAM BUBBLE

     has appeared.  Inside the bubble is a saw sawing back and
     forth through a log.  It is SYNCHRONIZED to the SOUND of
     Roger's SNORE.  Valiant kicks Roger, trying to stop the
     infernal SOUND.

     Roger sits up.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Huh?

     In the dream bubble, the saw cuts through the log.  One end
     of the log falls out of the bubble and BONKS Roger on the
     head, knocking him unconscious.  Valiant shakes his head and
     closes his eyes again.  We PAN UP off his face and PAST the
     window where the sun is setting.  As the CAMERA MOVES ALONG
     THE WALL, we see a gallery of framed newspaper clippings.
     "Valiant and Valiant Crack Popeye Kidnapping - Return Sweepea
     to Loving Arms of Parents".  And... "Brothers Find Brothers:
     Heckle and Jeckle Rescued From Redwood Forest!"  And...
     "Goofy Cleared of Atomic Spying Charges".  The PAN CONTINUES
     until we get to the window again.  Now it's dark outside.
     MOVE DOWN to Valiant's sleeping face.  He stirs. then opens
     one eye.  Now they both pop open at what he sees.


     VALIANT'S POV

     Roger has a magnifying glass an inch in front of his face
     that distorts his grinning face hideously.


     VALIANT

     startled from his sleep, reflexively shoves Roger away from
     him.  He flies into a swivel chair and goes spinning around.

                               VALIANT
                You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked
                you for the patsy.  Always gotta play
                the fool.  You make me sick!

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience,
                but what happened to you that was so
                dark, lurid, embittering?

                               VALIANT
                You wanna know?  Well, since you're so
                goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of
                you Toons killed my brother.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                A Toon?  Noooo.

                               VALIANT
                Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who
                killed Bambi's mother.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous,
                despicable... a smear on the drafting
                board.

                               VALIANT
                Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and
                Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All
                Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em.
                And when this guy was accused of
                knockin' over the First National Bank
                of Toontown, we took his case.  But
                when we looked into it, we found out he
                did do it after all.  We went to his
                house to take him in.  But he was wise.
                He got the drop on us... literally.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (wincing)
                Safe?
         
                               VALIANT
                Piano.  Guy got away, disappeared into
                Toontown.  Nobody ever saw him again.

     Now the PHONE on the desk RINGS.  Roger makes a move to it.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                I'll get it.

                               VALIANT
                Get away from there.

     The PHONE RINGS TWO MORE TIMES and stops.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                Wrong number?

                               VALIANT
                No, it's not.

     Valiant goes to the phone anticipating a RING which comes
     after a moment.  Valiant picks up the receiver.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Dolores?
         
                                              INTERCUT:


     DOLORES

     on the phone in the Terminal Bar.

                               DOLORES
               I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's
               called here about four times.  He says
               he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He
               says he can help you.

                               VALIANT
               I'll bet.

                               DOLORES
               Are you gonna call him, Eddie?

                               VALIANT
               What've I got to lose?  You okay,
               Dolores?

                               DOLORES
               Yeah... they closed me down for a
               coupla weeks.

                               VALIANT
               That'll work out just fine.  When this
               thing is over, I'll take you to
               Catalina.  How does that sound?

                               DOLORES
               Familiar.  Be careful, Eddie.

     Dolores hangs up the phone.

                                              INTERCUT TO:


     VALIANT

     He CLICKS the switchhook and dials.
         
                               VALIANT
               Maroon?  Whaddaya want?

                               MAROON
                      (on phone)
               Have you got the will?

                               VALIANT
               Maybe.  Why?

                               MAROON
                      (on phone)
               Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock.
               If you've got the will maybe we can
               stop this thing.

                               VALIANT
               Stop what?

     CLICK.  Maroon has hung up.  Valiant hangs up the phone and
     goes to a wall safe.  He spins the combination.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are
               ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine
               o'clock.

                               VALIANT
               That's why I'll be there at 8:45.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I tell you what, maybe I better come
               with you.

                               VALIANT
               Forget it.

     Valiant reaches into the safe for a .38 revolver.  He checks
     the cylinder. Then he takes out a wooden box about 8" X 12".
     He closes the safe, picks up a black doctor's bag and puts
     the box and the revolver into it.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a
               chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you
               think.

                               VALIANT
               How much is a shave and a haircut,
               Roger?

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (sheepish)
               Two bits.

                               VALIANT
               I rest my case.

     Valiant goes to the door, pauses.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               If I don't make it back here by ten...

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yeah?

                               VALIANT
               ... I'd head for Cucamonga.

     Valiant closes the door, leaving Roger alone.  Roger paces
     back and forth manically.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Cucamonga?  I don't know anybody in
               Cucamonga.


     EXT. MAROON STUDIO - NIGHT

     The lot is dark and deserted.  Now headlights cut through the
     darkness as Maroon's Packard pulls up in front of the
     Administration building.


     INT. CAR - MAROON

     reaches over and opens the glove compartment.  He takes out a
     small automatic.  But his hands are so slippery with
     perspiration, it falls to the floor.  Cursing, he takes out
     a handkerchief, wipes his hands and his face and picks up the
     gun again.  As he gets out of the car, we see the clock says
     8:55.


     INT. ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - NIGHT

     Maroon hustles up to his office door.  He looks nervously
     over his shoulder, then goes inside.


     INT. MAROON'S OFFICE

     Maroon switches on the lights.  He goes to his desk.  He
     takes out the gun and puts it in the left hand drawer.  Then
     he takes it out and puts it in the right hand drawer.  Then
     back to the original drawer.  Finally satisfied, he goes to
     the bar to calm his obviously shattered nerves.  As his
     shakey hand starts to pour from the decanter, another hand
     comes INTO FRAME.

                               VALIANT
               Steady, R.K., that stuff's eighteen
               years old.

     Maroon jumps back as Valiant steps from behind the curtain,
     holding his black bag.

                               MAROON
               Valiant!  You surprised me.

                               VALIANT
               That was the idea.

     Valiant takes over the pouring duties.  He turns and carries
     Maroon's drink to him.  Maroon goes and sits down in his
     chair.  He looks to the pistol hiding place.  Valiant
     casually sits on the desk, putting his legs over the drawer.

                               VALIANT
               You're not too good at this, are you,
               R.K.?

                               MAROON
               No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker,
               not a murderer.

                               VALIANT
               Well, everybody needs a hobby.

                               MAROON
               No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I
               had nothin' to do with Acme gettin'
               killed.  I just wanted to sell my
               studio.  But they wouldn't buy my
               property unless Acme would sell his.
               And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna
               blackmail Acme with pictures of him and
               the rabbit's wife.

     Maroon gets up from his chair, highly agitated.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               But then it all went to hell.  I been
               around Toons all my life.  I can't sit
               around and see them all destroyed.

     Maroon eyes Valiant's black bag.

                               MAROON
                      (continuing)
               You got the will in there, don't ya?

                               VALIANT
               No, I don't.

                               MAROON
               You tricked me, damn you!

                               VALIANT
               Take it easy.

                               MAROON
               There's no time to take it easy!  You
               don't realize the diabolical mind we're
               dealing with!


     ANGLE ON WINDOW

     A gun pokes through the open window past the curtain.  It's a
     Colt .45 Buntline -- an unmistakeable gun with an extra long
     barrel.

                               MAROON
               If I don't get that will by midnight
               tonight, Toontown's just gonna be land
               for the free...


     VALIANT

     sees a reflection of the gun on the glass on a movie poster
     on the wall.  He turns.  But it's too late.  BANG!  BANG!
     BANG!  Maroon crumples, caught mid-sentence.  Valiant dives
     behind the desk and draws his gun.  He looks over at Maroon's
     dead body on the floor.

                               VALIANT
               And the home of the brave?

     Valiant crawls to the window where the shots came from.  He
     looks out.


     VALIANT'S POV

     The comely silhouette of Jessica Rabbit runs to her car,
     jumps in and ROARS out the the studio gates.


     VALIANT

     grabs his black bag, climbs out of the office window and
     jumps off the fire escape to the lot below.


     EXT. STUDIO LOT

     Valiant hops into Maroon's Packard.  He hits the starter
     button and takes off after Jessica.


     NEW ANGLE

     as the car pulls away, the trunk lid lifts.  Roger Rabbit
     peers out, disoriented.  Then closes it.


     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     Jessica's car speeds along.  Valiant is in close pursuit in
     the Packard.  He's about to catch up on the straightaway when
     Jessica's car disappears into a tunnel.


     VALIANT

     slams on his brakes.  The Packard goes fishtailing, finally
     spinning to a stop at the foot of the "Toontown" sign.

     Valiant gets out of the car.  He looks down the tunnel.  He's
     sweating.  He loosens his necktie.  He paces back and forth
     at the tunnel mouth.  He looks up at the Toontown sign and
     suddenly smashes it with his fist.  It spins around like a
     weathervane.

     Valiant walks to the Packard with purpose.  He grabs the
     black bag and puts it on the hood.  He opens it and takes out
     the wooden box.


     CLOSE - BOX

     as the clasp is popped and the box opened, REVEAL a stunning
     presentation model TOON .38 resting on crushed velvet.  It's
     everything a real gun could be... and more.  Each feature is
     exaggerated... the barrel, the cylinder, the ivory grips are
     all Toon-sized.


     VALIANT

     picks the gun up and hefts it respectfully.  Then he opens an
     ammo section in the wooden box. SIX TOON .38 DUM-DUM BULLETS
     are in velvet creases.  The Toon Bullets blink to life as if
     awakening from a long sleep.

                               DUM-DUM #l
                      (rubbing eyes)
               Eddie... is that really you?

                               VALIANT
               Uh-huh.

                               DUM-DUM #2
               What year is it?

                               VALIANT
               '46.

                               DUM-DUM #3
               Who won the war?

                               DUM-DUM #4
               Who do you think, dummy?

                               DUM-DUM #5
               Welcome back, Eddie.

                               DUM-DUM #6
               Where you been the last five years?

                               VALIANT
               Drunk.

     He opens the cylinder.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Feelin' frisky tonight, boys?

                               DUM-DUMS
               Yeah!

     The Bullets eagerly dive into their respective chambers.  He
     snaps the cylinder closed, reaches into his shoulder holster
     and takes out the pint bottle.  He unscrews the cap and pours
     the rest of the booze onto the ground.  When it's drained, he
     flings the bottle in the air and FIRES the Toon .38.  KA-POW!
     It makes a SOUND like a CANNON.


     THE TOON BULLET

     climbs like a rocket into the dark sky.  It SCREECHES up to
     the bottle, puts on the brakes.  The Bullet puts on a
     jeweler's eyepiece, then it whips out a little hammer and
     chisel acd delivers one delicate tap.


     VALIANT

     watches as a cut glass chandelier falls out of the sky and
     CRASHES at his feet.  Valiant holsters his weapon and climbs
     into the Packard.  He puts it in gear and pulls into the
     tunnel.


     IN THE TUNNEL - DRIVING

     As Valiant heads toward the proverbial light at the end of
     the tunnel, suddenly the CAR RADIO COMES ON.

                               RADIO ANNOUNCER
               ... From the tippy tip top of
               Toontown's Tip Top Club, this is Mellow
               Melody Matinee.  Here's our favorite
               cricket, Jimmy, with 'Give A Little
               Whistle'.

                               JIMINY CRICKET
                      (on radio)
               'When you get in trouble, and you don't
               know right from wrong...'

     Valiant turns the on/off switch, then punches all the buttons
     but to no avail.  The SONG PLAYS ON anyway.

                               JIMINY CRICKET
                      (continuing)
               '... Give a little whistle
               Give a little whistle...'

                               VALIANT
               I hate Toontown...

     As Jimmy croons on, Valiant emerges from the tunnel.


     VALIANT'S FOV

     Through the windshield we see we have arrived in Toontown,
     where it's a beautiful sunny day.  Eddie is now driving down
     a phantasmagorical boulevard in a completely animated world.
     It's a Max Fleischer version of a city neighborhood.  The
     trees and buildings are swaying in time with the MUSIC.
     Eddie looks to his left and sees a huge Aphrodite-like hood
     ornament on the front of a TOON CAR.  Then as the car starts
     to pass him he sees hood... hood... hood... more hood then a
     CHAUFFEUR, then more car, and finally the Wolf we remember
     from the Ink & Paint Club.  He's in top hat and tails, a TOON
     LAMB in the passenger seat.  He tips his hat.

                               WOLF
               Helloooo, cousin.

     Now he drives past a Toon building under construction.  Like
     everything else in Toontown. the construction company sports
     the name "Acme".  The sign out frontsays:  WATCH OUR
     PROGRESS.  Eddie looks up, and before he can drive by, the
     building gets built floor by floor with accompanying SFX in
     about two seconds.

     Up ahead, the street is clear for blocks.  Then suddenly cars
     pour out of all side streets at once, clogging the boulevard
     like arteriosclerosis.  There is mad HONKING in this cartoon
     traffic jam.  Eddie shakes his head.  He pulls over, parks
     and gets out.

     Valiant pulls out his Toon .38.  Suddenly, the street empties
     in the blink of an eye.  Shutters close, and the sidewalk
     rolls up like window shades.  It's so quiet you could hear a
     pin drop.  In fact, a PIN DROPS from a second story window,
     landing with the CLANG! of a manhole cover.  All is quiet
     again.  Valiant starts across the street -- there is a CREAK
     behind him.  Valiant whirls around, levelling his pistol at
     the sound.


     ANGLE ON PACKARD - ROGER

     peeks out of the trunk of Maroon's car.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Don't shoot, Eddie.  It's me.

     Valiant lowers the gun as Roger emerges.

                               VALIANT
               What the hell are you doin' in there?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I followed you to the Maroon Studios.
               When I heard those shots, I thought I'd
               help you and investigate the inside of
               this trunk.

     Valiant reaches into the black bag in the car.  He comes out
     with a pair of TOON HANDCUFFS.  He slaps one on Roger's
     wrist.

                               ROGER RA13BIT
                      (continuing)
               Hey, what're you doin'?

     Valiant drags Roger to the steering wheel.

                               VALIANT
               I'm making sure you don't help me
               anymore.

     He locks the cuff to it, and heads across the street.


     AROUND THE CORNER - VALIANT

     stops at a street sign.  The post is bristling with fingers
     pointing in different directions; i.e., Poughkeepsie,
     Transylvania, Walla Walla, South Pole (the finger points down
     of course), and finally a finger which says:  The Dame.
     Eddie follows the finger down the side street to a high rise
     building.

     He catches a glimpse of Jessica darting into the elevators.
     Valiant hustles inside after her.

     Valiant goes to the elevators, and watches the floor
     indicator spinning round and Round, finally stopping with a
     BING at the 125th floor.  The elevator doors open and Valiant
     steps on.


     IN THE ELEVATOR

     Valiant punches 125.  Suddenly the elevator takes out with
     such velocity that Valiant is thrown to the floor.  After a
     moment, it stops so fast that he hits the ceiling.  Then
     bounces back to the floor as the doors open.  He picks
     himself up and steps off the elevator.

     He's in a foyer with four doors.  Valiant opens the first and
     steps inside.  He disappears.


     NEW ANGLE

     Valiant is on the outside of the building hanging onto a
     flagpole for dear life.  He looks down at the street which
     looks miles below.  Valiant inches back along the flagpole to
     the door and pulls himself to safety.


     INSIDE - VALIANT

     tries the next door.  This time more carefully.  A SPEEDING
     TRAIN is coming right at him.  He slams the door.  He tries
     the next one.  A homely OLD TOON LADY is in a bathtub.  She
     lets out a BLOODCURDLING SCREAM.  Valiant closes that door
     quickly, and turns to the last.  When he opens this one, we
     HEAR FOREBODING MUSIC.  We see...


     A DARK ALLEY

     Warily, Valiant walks into the alley, gun drawn.  There's a
     NOISE behind the garbage cans.  Valiant turns as a DEAD BODY
     with a knife in his back falls out of the shadows at
     Valiant's feet.  A SQUEAKY VOICE comes from behind Valiant.

                               VOICE
               I guess they didn't clean up after the
               last moider.

     Valiant whips around to see a TOON RAT perched on a skull
     picking his teeth.  Valiant kicks the skull.  The rat
     scrambles for cover.

     As Valiant continues on, we see...


     JESSICA RABBIT

     Steps out of the shadows behind him and aim the gun at his
     back.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Don't move, Valiant.

     Valiant turns slowly to see Jessica's got a bead on him with
     her revolver.

                               VALIANT
               Well... I always figured I'd get it in
               Toontown.

     BLAM!  She fires.  But Valiant's still standing.  We HEAR a
     CRASH behind Eddie as a figure falls into some boxes from a
     fire escape above.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               I think I got him.

     Jessica runs past Valiant to the figure.  He follows,
     bewildered.


     ANGLE ON GROUND

     We can see two rabbit ears sticking out from behind a box

                               VALIANT
               You shot Roger.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's
               men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.

     Jessica moves the box aside and tugs on the rabbit ears.  The
     rabbit head pops off.  Underneath is a Weasle.  In his hand
     is the Colt .45 Buntline.

                               VALIANT
               Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Don't worry, you're not the first.  We
               better get out of here.

     As they run down the alley...

                                              CUT TO:


     THE PACKARD - ROGER

     is behind the wheel making ENGINE NOISES like a little kid.
     He pushes all the buttons, windshield wipers, convertible
     top, etcetera, until he accidentally hits the starter button.
     VROOM!  The Packard fires to life.  Roger's startled for a
     moment, but quickly regains his composure.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hmmm... What would be the harm if I
               took her for a spin?

     He throws it into gear.  The Packard bucks into the car in
     front of it.  Then Roger shifts again.  The same process is
     repeated in reverse.  He SMASHES back and forth.  BANG!
     BANG!

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
                Ah... the open road.


     AROUND THE CORNER - EDDIE AND JESSICA

     come racing down the street.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?

                               VALIANT
               Why didn't you tell me?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               I didn't know who I could trust.

                               VALIANT
               We're even.  By the way, I did find
               your husband.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
                      (excited)
               Where is he?

                               VALIANT
               He's right here in the...

     Valiant rounds the corner and points toward the spot where
     the car used to be.  But all that remains is a crumpled
     bumper.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               ... car.

     He shakes his head and looks around for signs of Roger.

                                              INTERCUT TO:


     THE PACKARD

     is careening down Toon streets totally out of control.
     Panicked, Roger is spinning the wheel as if it were a
     motorboat.  He drives in one side of Mother Goose's Shoe and
     out the other, diapers all over the windshield.  Unable to
     see, Roger steers right off the road.  The car hurtles
     through space.  As it starts to fall, we see it's Toon
     Monument Valley.  The Packard passes a promontory on which
     WILE E. COYOTE is perched.  As Roger passes, he waves to the
     Coyote.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Hi, Roger Rabbit.  Love your work.

                                              INTERCUT TO:


     EDDIE AND JESSICA

     who are now facing a squad of TEN Toon Control Weasles.  They
     unleash a fusilade of bullets.

     Valiant knocks Jessica to the ground.  The bullets pass
     harmlessly overhead going into the window of the Acme Cheese
     Shop, riddling a round of cheese.  The CHEESEMAKER'S hand
     comes INTO FRAME changing the sign that says "Gouda" to
     "Swiss".

     Valiant rolls and FIRES his Toon .38 Special.  The Toon
     Bullet turns into a cannonball, which rolls down the street
     busting up the Weasle squad like a bowling ball through ten
     pins.

     As Eddie pulls Jessica to her feet, two more Weasles descend
     on them.  They fling Toon knives, which pin Eddie to a wooden
     fence.  Valiant rips one hand free, and BLASTS two shots at
     them.

     The Toon Bullets get to the Weasles, and open their nose
     cones.  Two frying pans emerge and BONK the Weasles on the
     head.

     Jessica starts to pull the knives out, releasing Eddie.

                               VALIANT
               How did you get onto Doom?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Marvin told me.  Doom was after his
               land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he
               brought me his will.

     Valiant sees a Weasle skulking at them with a tommygun.
     BLAM!  Valiant fires at him.  The Weasle ducks back around
     the corner.  But Valiant's Dum-Dum SCREECHES to a stop and
     goes around the corner, too.  We HEAR an EXPLOSION.  The
     Weasle come staggering out and falls in the street.

                               VALIANT
               So where is it?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               When I opened up the blue envelope, all
               that was inside was a blank piece of
               paper.

                               VALIANT
               A joker to the end.

     Now Weasles are coming at them from every direction.  Valiant
     aims the Toon .38 at a Toon tank rolling their way.  But when
     he pulls the trigger, the gun just CLICKS.  Empty.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Looks like our goose is cooked, our
               hash is slung, our fait is accompli...

                               VALIANT
               Lemme guess where you got that from.
               Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see
               in that guy anyway?

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               He made me laugh.

     Valiant shakes his head.  Now they are completely surrounded
     by Weasles.  The situation looks bleak.

                               VALIANT
               Well, do you prefer to die this way or
               that way?

     Valiant jerks his thumb indicating the direction behind him.
     Suddenly, there's a rubber-burning SCREECH as Benny the
     Roadster arrives next to Valiant's hitchhiker-posed thumb.

                               ROADSTER
               Need a lift?

     Valiant does a take.

                               VALIANT
               Benny.

     The Roadster looks back approvingly as Jessica climbs in with
     Eddie.

                               ROADSTER
               Mr. Valiant, you've made a vast
               improvement in the company you keep.

     Benny blasts through a couple of Weasles.  They swing back
     and forth like tavern doors, then topple.

     He takes a hard right into the next block which is the Toon
     Arctic.  His tires turn into skis.  He slaloms back and forth
     between trees.  The Weasles pursue on dogsled.

     Benny grabs a striped barber's pole -- the North Pole -- and
     slides down it.  They land in the Toon Sahara.  Benny crawls
     up a large sand dune, his tongue hanging out of his radiator.
     He glances back at the Weasles who are mounted on camels,
     waving scimitars.  When they reach the top of the sand dune,
     we see they're on the precipice of a bottomless chasm.

                               ROADSTER
               Look, the drawbridge -- we're gonna
               make it.

                               VALIANT
               I don't see any bridge.

                               ROADSTER
               That's because you gotta draw it first.

     Benny takes a pencil hanging from a post lettered "Draw
     Bridge".  He wets the pencil point and in a flash draws a
     bridge.  It's a rickety rope bridge.  Using the pencil as a
     balancing pole, Benny starts to tiptoe across.

     The Weasles jump off t'heir camels and start filing onto the
     bridge after them.

     When Benny finally reaches the other side, Valiant grabs the
     pencil from him and gets out of the car.

                               VALIANT
               Hold on a second.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Eddie, come on.

     But Valiant stands facing the Weasles, who are charging at
     him, swords raised.  With a sly smile, Valiant holds up the
     eraser end of the pencil.  This freezes the Weasles.  But as
     Valiant starts to erase a rope support, the eraser breaks off
     the pencil and falls down into the chasm.  The Weasles WHEEZE
     with relief and advance for the kill.  At the last second,
     Valiant takes the business end of the pencil and scribbles a
     handsaw.  He grabs it by the handle and saws the rope.  The
     bridge swings away, smacking the Weasles into the opposite
     canyon wall.  One by one, they slide off and disappear into
     the abyss.


     VALIANT

     climbs back into Benny.  The Roadster takes off again, making
     a skidding left turn onto the main drag.  As they make their
     break into the Toontown tunnel...


     EXT. TOONTOWN TUNNEL - L.A. SIDE - NIGHT

     A ten gallon drum is sitting by the side of the road under
     the Toontown sign.  From in the tunnel we hear the SOUND of
     Benny's ENGINE coming closer.  Now a foot comes out of the
     shadows and rests on the ten gallon drum.  As the SOUND of
     the ROADSTER gets VERY LOUD, the foot kicks the drum over,
     spilling a clear liquid across the road.


     NEW ANGLE - THE FOOT

     belongs to Judge Doom.  Doom smiles sadistically as the
     Roadster with Eddie and Jessica aboard comes shooting out of
     the tunnel.  When Benny hits the liquid, he starts to skid.

                               ROADSTER
               Uh-oh... whoaaa...!  Look out!

     His tires smoke, then disappear. It's a dip slick.  Without
     tires, Benny spins out of control, finally ending up in the
     bushes roadside.

     Before Eddie and Jessica can make a move, they are surrounded
     by a horde of Weasles pointing what looks like a hundred guns
     at them.

                               DOOM
               Are you two all right?

     Doom opens one of the Roadster's doors and helps Jessica out.
     Valiant climbs out after her.  The Weasles quickly relieve
     him of his Toon pistol.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               These roads can be very treacherous at
               night, especially in a maniacal Toon
               vehicle.

                               VALIANT
               The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.

                               DOOM
               I've had enough of your insolence!
                      (to Weasles)
               Put him in my car.  I think they'll
               enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at
               the Acme factory.

     The Weasles prod Valiant and Jessica into Doom's Lincoln.  A
     Weasle refers to Benny WHIMPERING in the bushes.

                               WEASLE
               What about him?

                               DOOM
               He's not going anywhere.  We'll send
               the mobile unit after him.

     Doom climbs into the car and it zooms off, Weasles jumping
     onto the running boards.


     BENNY

     crawls out of the bushes on his axles.

                               ROADSTER
               The boinin', the boinin'...

     He makes it down into the drainage ditch, dipping his
     tootsies one by one.  There's a HISS as they hit the water
     and the chemicals from the dip are extinguished.

                               ROADSTER
                      (continuing)
               Oh, yeah... that's better.

     Now Benny hears the SOUND of another VEHICLE COMING out of
     the Toontown Tunnel.  He ducks down and peeks over the ditch
     to see...


     ROGER IN THE PACKARD

     come SCREAMING out of the tunnel backwards.  Maroon's Packard
     looks like the winner of a demolition derby.

     Benny stands and waves to him.

                               ROADSTER
               Roger!

     Roger sees him and slams on the brakes, skidding the Packard
     into the Toontown sign.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Benny?

     Benny hobbles over to the Packard.  He pops his trunk and
     rummages around.  He comes out with Toon boltcutters.  He
     clips Roger's cuffs off.

                               ROADSTER
               Doom's got your wife and Valiant.  He
               took them to the Acme factory,

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Let's go!

     Benny nudges Roger to the passenger side.

                               ROADSTER
               Slide over, son.  It looks like you've
               done enough drivin' for tonight.

     Now the Toon Roadster gingerly gets behind the wheel of the
     Packard.  He hits the gas and the Packard lurches down the
     road.


     INT. ACME FACTORY - NIGHT

     Doom's car is parked inside.  There are several other
     vehicles as well.  There's a steamroller, a road grader, and
     a huge modified tanker truck.  It's mounted with a thousand
     gallon vat, the contents of which are being stirred by a
     motorized unit.  All the vehicles are marked with a large
     green four-leaf clover logo.


     VALIANT AND JESSICA

     are held at gunpoint by a couple of Weasles, while several
     others are busy JACKHAMMERING the brick wall at the far end
     of the factory.  Doom pulls on his rubber gloves, turns to
     the Weasles.

                               DOOM
               Frisk them.  See if they have the will.

     Several Weasles rush for the opportunity to frisk Jessica.
     The head Weasle slaps the others away.  Then WHEEZING
     laciviously, he turns to the task.  He starts to move his
     hands over her body when Jessica stomps her heel on his feet.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Get your hands off me, you little
               rodent!

     The Weasle hops away angrily and quickly frisks Valiant.  He
     turns to Doom and shakes his head.

                               DOOM
               No matter.
                      (checks watch)
               I don't expect the will to show up in
               the next fifteen minutes.  By then
               Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite
               legally.

                               VALIANT
               So you're Cloverleaf?

                               DOOM
               No one person is Cloverleaf.  We're a
               vast company with diverse interests...
               gasoline, tires, automobiles.


     AT THE BRICK WALL

     The jackhammering has stopped.  A Weasle plucks one brick out
     of the wall.  Toon light beams through.  He reaches into the
     hole in the wall and comes out holding a bunch of Toon
     bananas.  WHEEZING wickedly, he passes them out to his
     compatriots.  They devour the bananas, throwing the peels
     helter-skelter.


     VALIANT

     turns his attention from the brick wall back to Doom.

                               VALIANT
               Come on, Doom.  What would a company
               like that want with Toontown?

                               DOOM
               It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was
               my idea of how to put the land to
               better use.

     Doom goes to the truck and starts turning on valves and
     starting compressors.
                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               In fact, they thought my concept so
               brilliant, that they offered me the
               Directorship of Transportation.  I've
               accepted.
                      (to Weasle)
               Bring me Mr. Valiant's gun.

     The Weasle trots over and delivers Valiant's Toon .38.  Doom
     inspects it.  He reads an engraving on the frame.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               'Thanks for getting me out of the
               hoosegow.  Yosemite Sam'.
                      (looks up)
               How sweet.

     Doom throws the gun on the ground.  He pushes back a long
     lever on the truck, letting loose a tiny spurt of fluid from
     the discharge valve.  The gun disappears.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Dip?

                               DOOM
               That's right.  Enough to dip Toontown
               off the face of the earth.


     EXT. ACME FACTORY - ROGER AND BENNY

     have been watching the proceedings through a window.  They
     turn to each other stunned.

                               BENNY/ROGER RABBIT
               Dip Toontown?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               We gotta do something!

     Roger scurries back to the Packard hidden outside the gates.
     He opens Valiant's black bag and comes out holding Eddie's
     real pistol.  Benny comes tenderfooting up.

                               ROADSTER
               Roger, what're you gonna do with that
               gun?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I'm gonna save them, of course.  You go
               for help.  Find Dolores at the Terminal
               Bar.  She'll know what to do.

                               ROADSTER
               Well... all right...

     Reluctantly, Benny gets behind the wheel of the Packard.

                               ROADSTER
                      (continuing)
               But you be careful now with that gun.
               This ain't no cartoon.

     Benny pulls away.  Roger turns with determination and zips
     back to the window


     INT. FACTORY

     Doom pulls the tarp off the top of the truck, revealing a
     modified water cannon.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               You're sick, Doom.  Where do people
               like you come from?

                               DOOM
               Never mind where I come from.  Just
               watch where I'm going.

                               VALIANT
               Don't you think anyone's gonna notice
               that Toontown's gone?

                               DOOM
               They won't care.  Who's going to miss
               some ridiculous talking mice when they
               can have the future?


     EXT. BACK OF FACTORY - ROGER

     is trying to jimmy open a window using his whole body for
     leverage.  He finally pops the window open.  Gun drawn, he
     climbs over the sill.  And falls head first.


     INT. BATHROOM

     Roger splashes into the toilet bowl in the Acme washroom.  He
     bobs up.  He drains the water out of the pistol barrel and
     peeks over the bowl.  He gets a determined look in his eye.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               It's time to make my move.

     Roger starts to climb out of the toilet.  He reaches for
     something to grab onto.  Unwittingly, he gets the toilet
     chain hanging from the tank above.  As he pulls himself out,
     the toilet flushes.   Roger has only a moment to register a
     dumbfounded expression before he is sucked down the john.


     IN THE FACTORY - DOOM

     continues expansively.

                               DOOM
               Right here where we're standing, will
               be the cornerstone of my idea... the
               cloverleaf -- an elegant cement
               structure that intertwines freeways.

                               VALIANT
               What the hell's a freeway?

                               DOOM
               A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes
               of asphalt running uninterrupted from
               L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to
               Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica.
               Someday everyone will be in cars
               driving happily, non-stop from one end
               of the L.A. Basin to another.

                               VALIANT
               That's what this is all about?  Tell
               me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway?
               We got the Red Cars, the best public
               transportation in the country.

                               DOOM
               Not for long.  We're retiring the Red
               Cars.  People will drive, Mr. Valiant,
               because they'll have to.  And when they
               drive, they'll have to buy our cars,
               our tires, our gasoline.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Why'd you bother to call it a freeway?

     Doom steps up into their faces.  Behind him, several Weasles
     are fashioning a noose.

                               DOOM
               Has a nice ring.  Too bad you two won't
               be around to enjoy it.

     Suddenly Roger EXPLODES out of the drainage grate in the
     floor.  His entrance sends the Weasles flying.  Roger lands
     on his feet, James Cagney-like, levelling his gun on Judge
     Doom.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Get 'em up.  All of you!  Or I let the
               Judge have it!

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Roger, darling!

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yes, it's me, my dearest.  I'd embrace
               you but first I have to take care of
               some unfinished business.

                               DOOM
               Put that gun down, you buck-toothed
               fool.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Go ahead.  Give me an excuse to fill
               you full of holes, pump you full of
               lead.
                      (over shoulder)
               How'm I doin', Eddie?

                               VALIANT
               Real good, Rog... but maybe you better
               let me take over.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Not before I satisfy my sense of moral
               outrage.

     Milking the moment, he shifts the gun from one hand to
     another.  He circles Doom, poking and prodding him with the
     gun.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               You think you could get away with this?
               Hah!  We Toons may be idiotic, but
               we're not stupid!


     POV OVERHEAD

     We LOOK DOWN on the proceedings from high in the rafters.
     PULL BACK TO REVEAL we're watching from the POV of Voltaire,
     who's perched on the top inventory rack.  Voltaire cleans his
     fingernails, casually.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yes, justice, Judge Doom.  The real
               meaning of the word probably hits you
               like a ton of bricks!

     Voltaire calmly nudges an Acme Ton-Of-Bricks off the shelf.


     CLOSE - ROGER

     He never sees it coming.  SMASH!  The bricks land on his head
     and bury him.  The only thing we can see of Roger is his hand
     with the gun in it.

                               DOOM
               Well, this is turning out better than
               I thought.

     Doom picks the gun up.  The Weasles drag Roger out from under
     the bricks.  Big bright stars are circling his head.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (delirious)
               Look, stars!  Ready when you are,
               Raoul.

     Valiant shakes his head, but Jessica starts to laugh.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               I have missed you, Roger.

                               DOOM
               Tie the lovebirds together.

     The Weasles twirl Toon rope around Roger and Jessica like a
     cocoon.  They hook them on a power winch.  Then hit a button
     and raise Roger and Jessica until they're suspended fifteen
     feet above the floor... right in the path of the Dipmobile.

     Doom hands Valiant's gun to the head Weasle.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Let him watch his Toon friends get
               dipped...  then shoot him.

     Doom turns and starts to walk away.


     ANGLE ON GROUND

     He steps on a Toon banana peel and goes flat on his keester.


     THE WEASLES

     always quick with a laugh, BREAK UP at their boss'
     misfortune.  The one guarding Eddie is so overcome with
     LAUGHTER that he's slapping his thigh with his gun hand.
     Valiant sees his opportunity.  He starts to make a move
     toward the distracted Weasle and almost gets his hands on the
     gun when:

                               DOOM
               Watch out, you idiot... he's going for
               the gun!

     The Weasle turns at the last second, sticking the barrel up
     against Valiant's nose.  Doom gets to his feet.  He glowers
     at the Weasle and knocks him on the head with the gavel head
     of his cane.  Doom stalks out of the room.

     The Weasles scramble to positions on the Dipmobile.  One
     FIRES UP the ENGINE.

     The streetcleaner brushes start to turn.  The vehicle starts
     to creep forward.

     Another Weasle climbs into the turret.  He puts Roger and
     Jessica in the crosshairs of the cannon.

     Beads of sweat break out on Valiant's face.

     The Weasle, WHEEZING with evil glee, starts to press his
     finger to the trigger.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               You guys think this is real funny,
               doncha?
                      (to Valiant)
               Eddie, do somethin'!

     At the last second, Eddie shouts at the Weasle.

                               VALIANT
               Hey!

     The Weasle turns to him.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Before you pull the trigger, I want you
               to know somethin' about the guy you're
               about to dip.

     Suddenly, Eddie breaks into the "Looney Tooney Song".  The
     song Roger had sung in the bar.  The silly voice that comes
     out of his mouth surprises everybody, especially Roger.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing;
                       sings)
               'His name is Roger Rabbit
               He's got a crazy habit...'

     Valiant starts skulking across the floor.  It's a cross
     between Groucho Marx and a Chuck Berry Duck Walk.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing;
                       sings)
               'He likes to sing and dance and yuk
               So brighten up and smile you
                  schmuck...'

     Valiant starts "hoo-hooing", slapping himself in the
     forehead.  Now the Weasles start GIGGLING.  They've never
     seen a human do this before.

                               VALIANT
               'Now my name's Eddie V
               I'm looney too you'll see'

     Valiant flips into a handstand and starts walking on his
     hands.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               'I walk with my hands
               And I shake with my feet...'

     He offers his foot to a Weasle who shakes it.  The others
     HOWL.  Eddie flips upright and grabs a stick of Acme
     dynamite.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               'I think dynamite
               Is swell to eat'.

     Eddie takes a bite out of the Toon dynamite and acts like
     he's savoring it.  The spectacle of this human doing this is
     too much to bear.  Now the Weasles are rolling on the ground,
     holding their sides.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               He's lost his mind!

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yeah, isn't it great?  Keep it up,
               Eddie... you're killing 'em, you're
               slayin' 'em, you're knockin' 'em dead.

     Roger means it.  The Weasles are laughing so hard they're
     giving themselves heart attacks.  Valiant spins around on the
     floor like a clock dial gone berserk.

                               VALIANT
               Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo...

     One by one, the Weasles keel over... dead.  Opaque WEASLE
     SPIRITS leave their bodies with wings and harps, and float
     heavenward, still laughing.


     VOLTAIRE

     alarmed at the scene below, grabs a brick and flaps toward
     the ceiling.  He throws the brick through the skylight and
     flies out.

                               VOLTAIRE
               Doom!  Doom!


     ON THE DIPMOBILE

     The Weasle on the turret collapses onto the trigger.  The
     unmanned dip cannon starts spraying, as the arm sweeps
     slowly back and forth like an, automatic lawn sprinkler.


     VALIANT

     hitches a ride on the last ascending Weasle Spirit, letting
     it hoist him to the top of the truck.  As he moves the Weasle
     body off the trigger...


     VOLTAIRE

     CRASHES back through the skylight and swoops down on Eddie.
     He sinks his talons into Eddie's back and lifts him into the
     air.

     As Valiant is being pulled skyward he reaches for something
     along the wall of inventory.  He grabs a handful of Acme
     Small Pills and jams a couple dowm the buzzard's mouth.
     Instantly, Voltaire starts to shrink.  As he gets smaller, he
     can no longer hold Eddie up.  They both descend as Voltaire
     shrinks to the size of a chick.

     The sprayer is swinging back towards Roger and Jessica.  At
     the last second, Valiant reaches up and blocks it.  It swings
     back the other way.

     As Valiant scrambles up on the vehicle to turn it off,
     Voltaire has found a box of Acme Big Pills.  He pecks into
     it... and after a beat, EXPLODES out of the box.  He's now
     three times the size he was before.  Voltaire flaps in for
     the kill.

     Valiant reaches the turret just in time to swing the cannon
     around.  The spray of dip blasts one of Voltaire's wings off.
     He spins earthward like a flaming Messerschmidt, finally
     landing in the dip vat and dissolving into a black pool.

     Doom arrives just in time to see his pet bird dissolved.
     Angrily, he steps onto a giant Acme Mousetrap.  He uses a
     piece of Acme cheese to spring it, catapulting him through
     the air.

     Just as Valiant is about to turn off the dip cannon, Doom
     lands on the truck.  He knocks Eddie off the turret with a
     flying tackle.  They both hit the floor.

     Doom gets up, leaving Eddie stunned.  He sprints to where the
     Weasle had dropped Eddie's pistol.  Finally Eddie shakes it
     off.  He sees Doom about to reach the gun.  He straps on a
     pair of Acme Rocket Skates, fires them up and shoots across
     the floor.  He knocks Doom into a stack of Acme boxes,
     toppling the whole shelf down on top of him.

     As the sprayer swings back toward Roger and Jessica, they
     have their last moment together.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Roger, I want you to know I love you.
               I loved you more than any woman has
               ever loved a rabbit.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Be comforted in the knowledge that as
               we face the Grim Dipper, our paint will
               be comingled for eternity.

     They both close their eyes, waiting for the end.  But it
     never cames.  The truck runs up on some boxes and the sprayer
     arm swings back the other way.

     Doom grabs an Acme slingshot, loads an Acme boulder and fires
     it at Valiant.  BLAM!  It whacks Valiant on the head, laying
     him out cold in front of the Cloverleaf steamroller,

     Doom climbs into the steamroller and starts it up.  He puts
     it into gear and starts it rolling toward Valiant.

     Valiant comes around to see the huge roller bearing down on
     him.  At the last second, Valiant rolls out of the way and
     grabs an Acme boxing glove.  It accordians out and smashes
     Doom in the face.  He goes flying out of the driver's seat,
     turning the wheel as he falls.  The steamroller starts to
     turn in circles.

     Valiant jumps Doom.  But Doom is stronger.  He throws Valiant
     off and starts whacking him with his fist.  He pummels
     Valiant backward toward the drum of the steamroller.  Valiant
     grabs the nearest thing for defense.  It's a can of Acme
     Stay-Put Adhesive.  He whips it up in front of his face.
     Doom puts his fist right through it, covering his hand with
     glue.  He smiles at Valiant and hauls off again.  Valiant
     ducks.  Doom's fist strikes the top of the drum of the
     steamroller.  Frantically he tries to pull it off.  But it
     "Stays-Put".  The roller starts to suck his fist down and
     under.

                               DOOM
               Nooooo!

     Jessica and Roger avert their eyes as the steamroller crushes
     Doom.

     Valiant breathes a sigh of relief.  He starts for the dip
     truck as the cannon swings back toward Roger and Jessica.
     But neither of them are watching the cannon.  Their eyes are
     fixed on the ground behind the steamroller.


     ANGLE ON GROUND

     There isn't the messy pile of blood and guts you'd expect to
     see if a human got run over.  Instead, we see that Judge
     Doom's remains have rolled out like a flat black pancake.
     After a beat, an edge curls up with a CREAK.  Now the whole
     shape peels off the floor and wobbles to it's feet. REVEALING
     DOOM IS A TOON.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Eddie, look out!


     VALIANT

     turns to see Doom stick his flattened thumb in his mouth.  He
     blows, re-inflating himself.  His glasses CRACK and fall off.
     Then his prosthetic eyeballs pop out.  His teeth shatter and
     fall out of his mouth like china.  Underneath his latex mask
     we can see his Toon mouth and evil red Toon eyes.

                               VALIANT
               Holy shit, he's a Toon!

                               DOOM
               Surprised?

                               VALIANT
               Not really.  Only a Toon could think of
               something as goofy as that freeway
               idea.

     Doom takes the black rubber gloves off, REVEALING red hands
     with long fingernails.  He makes his fist into an anvil and
     advances on Valiant.

                               DOOM
               Is that so?  Well, we'll see who's the
               goofy one.

     BLAM!  From ten feet away, he smashes Valiant with a
     bone-crushing punch.  Valiant staggers backwards.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               By the way, when I killed your brother,
               Teddy, I used to talk just like this.

     Doom spesks in a Toony high-pitched squeak.  Valiant
     recognizes him now.

                               VALIANT
               You?

                               DOOM
               That's right, me.

     BLAM!  Doom hammers Valiant again.  He's defenseless against
     Doom's super human strength.  BLAM!  Valiant goes
     sprawling to the ground.  Now Doom's hand turns into a
     buzzsaw.  He goes to administer the coup de grace.

                               DOOM
                      (continuing)
               Now Eddie's gonna be deady, just like
               Teddy.

     With his last ounce of strength, Valiant grabs the Acme
     Boxing Glove.  He pops it.  The glove extends across the
     room, punching the release lever on the dip truck.


     CLOSE - VALVE

     A flood of dip gushes out of the valve and rolls toward Doom
     like a wave.


     DOOM

     SCREAMS as the torrent hits him with a CRASH.  But there's no
     escape for him this time.  The flood of liquid envelopes him
     at the ankles.  He dissolves into it like a melting candle.


     THE DIPMOBILE

     continues forward inexorably.  The arm is swinging towards
     Roger and Jessica.  It gets closer and closer...

     Valiant tries to get to the truck, but it's too late.  The
     cannon has reached them.


     CLOSE - ROGER AND JESSICA

     They close their eyes, preparing to meet their Maker.  But
     nothing happens.

     The spray of the cannon suddenly peters out.  It dries up in
     a harmless drip as the tank has completely emptied.

     Valiant gets to the controls of the power winch.  He hoists
     Roger and Jessica up out of the way.  The Dipmobile passes
     harmlessly underneath them and SMASHES through the brick
     wall.


     TOONTOWN

     is REVEALED in all its splendor.  It's a bucolic setting.  A
     rainbow shares the blue sky with a smiling sun.  Fawns and
     butterflies, chipmunks and flowers watch curiously as the dip
     truck rolls past.  Suddenly it's lifted off the ground.  We
     see it's resting on the top of a TOON GIANT's head.  This
     Giant plucks the truck off his head, regards it, then pops it
     in his mouth.


     VALIANT

     lowers Roger and Jessica to the ground.  We HEAR POLICE
     SIRENS approach.  When Valiant unties them, Jessica turns and
     exclaims...

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               My hero!

     Then she hugs Roger passionately.  Valiant can only shrug.


     THROUGH THE WALL - TOONS

     start coming in.  They look around at the scene, bewildered,
     then gather around Doom's robe, mask and shoes lying in the
     puddle of dip.  There's a reddish slick floating on top.
     Valiant wanders over and joins them.

                               VALIANT
               Hi-ho, the Doom is dead.


     ANGLE ON DOOR

     Dolores, Lt. Santino, and several other COPS rush in, guns
     drawn.  Dolores runs to Eddie and puts her arms around him.
     Santino looks down at the remains on the floor.

                               LT. SANTINO
               What the hell is that?

                               VALIANT
               Doom.

                               LT. SANTINO
               Jesus Christ... that was the Judge?

     Valiant takes the paint chip out of his pocket.  He puts it
     up against the red slime on the robe.  It's a match.

                               VALIANT
               That was the murderer of Herman Acme,
               Maroon... and my brother.

     Dolores looks down at the front of Valiant's shirt.  A dark
     stain is appearing.

                               DOLORES
               Eddie, we better get you to hospital.
               You're bleedin'.

     Valiant looks down at the stain.

                               VALIANT
               That's not blood.  That's ink.  That
               goof Acme squirted me with some the
               other day.  Why it's comin' 'through
               now, I don't know.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               That's because it's
               Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up
               three days later.  Gives you enough
               time to get away from the victim so he
               doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great
               gag.

                               VALIANT
               Yeah...

                               DOLORES
               I'll treat you to a new shirt.  After
               all, you did save Toontown.

                               JESSICA RABBIT
               Problem is without Marvin's will, the
               land still goes to Cloverleaf.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               That's right.  If only we knew what
               happened to that will...

     Valiant looks up from his shirt.

                               VALIANT
               Say Roger, remember that love letter
               you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint
               Club?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Yeah?

                               VALIANT
               I think you oughta read it to her.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Good idea.

     He reaches in his pocket, pulls out the paper and clears his
     throat.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing;
                       reads)
               Dear Jessy... How do I love thee?  Let
               me count the... I, Marvin Acme, of
               sound mind and body... Hey?


     CLOSE - PAPER

     The Disappearing-Reappearing Ink is coming up over Roger's
     scribbling.

                               VALIANT
               Keep reading...

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (reads)
               Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of
               sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo,
               do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the
               property known as Toontown to those
               loveable characters...

     PAN the Toon crowd, who are listening to the reading of the
     will.  It is a gallery of recognizable faces.  Everyone from
     Mickey to Bugs, Yakky Doodle to Yosemite Sam, Dumbo to Dopey,
     Bambi to Droopy, Tweety Bird to Tinkerbell.  They're all
     there.

                               ROGER RABBIT
                      (continuing)
               ... who have given me and the rest of
               humanity so much mirth and merriment...
               the Toons.

     The Toon crowd erupts with a CHEER!  Hats go in the air and
     they descend on Roger, slapping his back.  Roger breaks away
     from the crowd and joins Eddie.


     TWO SHOT - EDDIE AND ROGER

     They stand side by side, looking out over Toontown.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               Well, Eddie, you still think I'm a
               patsy, a simp, a chump?

     Eddie wipes the spit off his face.

                               VALIANT
               No, kid, you're a real hero.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               I guess I am at that.  Cigar?

     Roger holds out a large stogie.

                               VALIANT
               Why not?

     Roger lights Eddie's and one for himself.

                               VALIANT
                       (continuing)
               By the way, Roger, you were right about
               your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm
               glad you got her back.

                               ROGER RABBIT
               And I'm glad you got your sense of
               humor back.  Think you'll keep it?

                               VALIANT
               Only time will tell.

     Valiant puffs on the cigar.

                               VALIANT
                      (continuing)
               Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?

                               ROGER RABBIT
               From this box here...

     Valiant glances down.  The box says, "Acme Exploding Cigars".
     He looks to Roger, but it's too late.  KABOOM!  KABOOM!
     Their cigars blow up in classic Toon tradition, blackening
     both their faces.  Roger starts laughing.  Eddie stares at
     Roger for a moment, then he starts laughing too.  They throw
     their heads back in a HOWL.  The other Toons join in.  Pretty
     soon the whole factory is shaking with LAUGHTER.


     A TOON COP

     dressed in blue uniform and hat with his back to us tries to
     restore order in the Acme factory.  As soon as he talks, we
     recognize the stutter.  It's PORKY PIG.

                               PORKY PIG
               O-k-k-k, mmmove along.  There's
               nnnothin' else to see.  T-t-that's it.
               T-t-that's all, folks.
                      (turns to
                       CAMERA)
               Hmm, I l-l-like the sound of that.

     Then, savoring the phrase, Porky stutters out the famous
     sign-off.

                               PORKY PIG
                      (continuing)
                Eee-ba-da, eee-ba-da... t-t-that's all,
                folks!

     CARTOON MUSIC UP.

                                               IRIS OUT.

                                THE END
WHO'S YOUR DADDY

               FADE IN:

               EXT. ABOVE THE CLOUDS - DAY

               We fly high above heavenly clouds.  Beneath a brilliant blue
               sky.  A TEENAGED BOY'S VOICE greets us...

                                   TED NELSON (V.O.)
                         On any given day, your life can
                         change in the blink of an eye. 
                         It's a cliché, I know...

               Descending through the clouds, we are caught for a moment in
               a dreamy gauze.  We emerge to find ourselves gliding above a
               small town.  Descending lower.  And lower.  To Xenia, Ohio.

                                   TED (V.O.)
                         ...But a lot of clichés get to be
                         clichés because they're true. Your
                         life CAN change in the blink of an
                         eye.  What I mean is, one day
                         you're a regular chump, a wannabe
                         something.  You're not even totally
                         sure WHAT you wannabe...

               We pass over the town square. A fine spring day in middle
               America. Red brick buildings with names like "Miller & Son
               Drugs," "Two Sisters Gifts," "Nelson Family Market."   You
               can almost smell the rosy cheeks and moral fiber.

                                   TED (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                         ...The next day the doorbell rings
                         and some stranger's holding your
                         ticket to being SOMEBODY. 

               Still flying over the town, we focus on a TEENAGED BOY on a
               Schwinn.  We follow as he pedals his way to...

               TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL

               A three story building.  Older, brick, sturdy.  Meticulously
               maintained.

                         It happens every day.  Dreams come
                         true.  And not just for those dim
                         witted chain-smoking hillbillies
                         you see on TV.  You know, the ones
                         who win the Super Lotto and spend
                         their fortune on a truck full of
                         Goobers and a new set of front
                         teeth.  It could happen to any guy,
                         any time...even ME.

               EXT. TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

               A JANITOR raises the American flag.  It flaps proudly as the
               teenager chains his bike to a bike rack.
               He glances up at the flag, which is reflected in his uber-hip
               sunglasses.  When he smiles, in SLOW MO, his teeth seem to
               sparkle.

                         Uh, that's not me.  I'm over here.  

               We SWISH PAN to another teenager, locking his bike.  Meet our
               much less glamorous hero:  TED NELSON, 17.  A decent looking
               kid.  Not hip enough to be cool.  Not square enough to be
               tormented. He joins the other KIDS heading into the school.

                         You're disappointed, I know. I
                         admit, I was hopeless back then.
                         The 'do, the shades, ugh. But I
                         always had good taste in women.

               CHRISTY MALONE, 17, fills her cheerleader uniform in all the
               right places. We watch her at her locker. Also in SLOW MO.
               Which makes even her most mundane task seem graceful. Wow,
               just look at her stack those books. 

                                   TED (V.O.)
                         That's Christy Malone.  Head
                         cheerleader, love of my life, lust
                         of my loins.  

               Christy glances off screen and SQUEALS excitedly.  Another
               cheerleader enters the frame, holding a newspaper called
               "EXPOSED!"  Christy reads the headline.

                                   CHRISTY
                         "Health Teacher Flunks Her Own
                         Lesson!"  No WAY!  It's Miss Pratt,
                         smoking a doobie!

               Christy calls to Ted....

                                   CHRISTY (CONT'D)
                         Look at this, Ted! Imagine if we
                         did THIS in the school paper!

               She shows him "Exposed!" Ted gawks. Happy just to be this
               close to Christy. But they are quickly interrupted by...

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN (O.S.)
                         Hand them over! Immediately!

               PRINCIPAL RICHARD MERKIN, mid-50's, marches down the hallway,
               seizing copies of "EXPOSED!" from students' hands. We can see
               that it is a "homemade" looking newspaper. And there's
               obviously much ado about it.  Christy winks at Ted as she
               hides the newspaper in her locker.

                         Look at that smile.  That wink.
                         That's no platonic wink. That's a
                         wink that says, "I don't just want
                         you, Ted. I NEED you." So of course
                         I had to ask her to the prom. I
                         mean, she was practically begging
                         for it.

               INT. TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - NEWSROOM - DAY

               Ted ambles toward Christy. Struggling for nonchalance.  She
               limbers up by stretching her leg high against the wall. She
               whispers to another CHEERLEADER.  They giggle.  Then Christy
               turns to Ted.  Flashing that perfect smile of hers.

                                   CHRISTY
                         Just the guy I've been looking for.

               Ted wipes his sweaty palms on his jeans...

                                   TED
                         I've been looking for you, too. 

               Christy continues stretching.  Driving Ted crazy with her
               contortionist moves.

                                   CHRISTY
                         Wouldn't it be awesome if we were
                         about to say the exact same thing?

                                   CHRISTY
                         Well. The prom's coming up.

                                   TED
                         Yeah?

                                   CHRISTY
                         And I was wondering.

                                   TED
                         Yeah?

                                   CHRISTY
                         If you don't have...I mean...

               She looks up at him with gorgeous blue eyes. Then blurts...

                                   CHRISTY (CONT'D)
                         Teddy? Would you please please
                         please take me to the prom?

                                   TED
                         SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of
                         course I will...of course.

               Christy joyously jumps into Ted's arms.  Wrapping her legs
               around him in a passionate embrace.  The entire room
               APPLAUDS.

                                   CHRISTY
                         You are the most wonderful guy in
                         the whole wide world, and I love
                         you madly, Teddy Nelson!

               And just as she's about to plant one right on his lips...

               The shrill ringing of a TORNADO DRILL ALARM snaps Ted out of
               his reverie. A large glass window separates Ted's EDITOR-IN
               CHIEF office from the rest of the school newsroom.  We
               realize now that Ted has only been gazing through the window
               at Christy, watching her stretch those gorgeous limbs of
               hers.

                         Sorry about that.  A cheap trick, I
                         know.  But it's my story and my
                         fantasy. So cut me some slack.

               Ted joins his schoolmates, lining up on both sides of the
               hallway.  Far from any windows. They all know the drill. 
               Christy's just across the hall from Ted.  He can't take his
               eyes off of her.

               CHARLIE DUKE, 17, approaches Ted.  He's got a camera around
               his neck and so much confidence, it's a wonder he can balance
               his head on his shoulders.

               A cheerleader's ripe buttocks, peeking out from beneath a
               short pleated skirt.  As she kicks and jumps, her little red
               panties wedge themselves firmly between her cheeks. The
               camera skillfully tracks her movements, waiting until...

               The cheerleader's hand comes down.  In SLOW MO, her finger
               slips under her panties and tugs on the fabric, pulling it
               over her cheeks.  Charlie's motor drive whirls.

                         That vibe is from your wrist, pal.
                         You've been over-tenderizing your

               Charlie secretly shows Ted a nudie magazine. "HEAVEN." A

                         "Exposing Hypocrisy in the Morons
                         who Teach Us." That's the little
                         bastard's motto!

               The teachers turn to MISS PRATT.  We recognize her from the
               cover of "EXPOSED!"

                                   MISS PRATT
                             (summoning courage)
                         Principal Merkin, I realize we have
                         to teach the children that
                         recreational drugs are the devil's
                         work, but that doesn't mean we
                         don't dance with the Prince of
                         Darkness ourselves, every now and
                         again. 

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN
                         Ah, well, bravo!  That's just what
                         we'll tell the school board.

               Suddenly, an AIR VENT pops open and CRASHES on top of a
               coffee machine.  THE WHOLE ROOM, IN SHOCKED SILENCE, turns to
               look at...

               JULIE, her head framed by the air duct.  She holds a digital
               camera in her hand. Her expression says: "Oh, shit."

               Principal Merkin narrows his eyes at the "little bastard" who
               has been making his life hell.

               INT. TED'S OFFICE - NEWSROOM - DAY

               Julie sits in a chair in front of Ted's desk. She and Ted
               size up one another. 

                                   TED (V.O.)
                         Merk's punishment was cruel.
                         Expulsion without appeal. Or
                         working for me on the school paper.
                         The school paper would be torture
                         for a gonzo reporter like Julie and
                         we both knew it. But what choice
                         did she have?

               Julie leans back on the chair, rests her feet on Ted's files,
               and blows a huge bubble.

                                   JULIE
                         So, William Randolph. Your last big
                         scoop contrasted the popularity of
                         Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate
                         Snickerdoodles at the annual bake
                         sale.

                                   TED
                         That's just one example. My
                         reporting has made a difference.

                                   JULIE
                         Let me guess: retail sales of
                         little chocolate sprinkles have
                         gone through the roof! 

                                   TED
                         The school dumpsters used to
                         overflow to the point where the
                         stench was unbearable. My award
                         winning exposé changed all that.
                         The city added an extra weekday
                         trash pick-up.

               Julie deadpans...

                                   JULIE
                         Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?

                                   TED
                         Look, I loved "Exposed!" and I hate
                         it that you got busted. I know the
                         school paper sucks in comparison,
                         but it's really not THAT BAD. 

               Ted's eyes wander to Christy, who prances around the
               newsroom.  Julie notices.

                                   JULIE
                         Don't even tell me you're hot for
                         Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.

                                   TED
                         Christy's a very talented
                         journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her
                         future.

                                   JULIE
                         I didn't know they gave them for
                         Best Lip Gloss Retention During a
                         Blow Job.

                                   TED
                         Me-ow.

                                   JULIE
                         Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get
                         it over with.

                                   TED
                         I have absolutely no intention--

                                   JULIE
                         --Do it. I triple-dog-dare you.

               BACK TO CORRIDOR

               Ted nears Christy.  Students stare as he passes.  They elbow
               one another.  Whispering.

                                   TED (V.O.)
                         So you see, this is really about a
                         triple-dog-dare. I don't even know
                         what it means. I just know, unless
                         it's a felony, a triple-dog-dare
                         pretty much has to be met with
                         immediate action.

               Ted seems unaware that all eyes are upon him.  The cacophony
               of the corridor settles.  He gets down on one knee in front
               of Christy. 

               Christy looks down on Ted.  Smiles that smile.  Which freezes
               as her eyes dart.  Realizing that everyone is staring at them
               with great anticipation.

                                   TED (CONT'D)
                         Uh, Christy, I was wondering...

                                   ALL STUDENTS
                         WOULD YOU GO TO THE PROM WITH
                         ME?!!!

               The corridor explodes with LAUGHTER.  Ted flushes with
               embarrassment.  Christy looks mortified.

                                   CHRISTY
                             (through gritted teeth)
                         Ted, have you lost your mind?

                                   TED
                         You like me. I like you. I guess
                         it's pretty obvious to everyone.

                                   CHRISTY
                         I don't LIKE you. We're JUST
                         FRIENDS.

                                   TED
                         But that smile.

                                   CHRISTY
                         Oh, Ted, DUH.  I smile at everyone
                         since I got my braces off. 

                                   TED
                         So you'll think about it?

               Christy laughs derisively.

                                   CHRISTY
                         You really don't get it, do you? I
                         am genetically programmed to desire
                         a big, buff, manly man who can
                         defend and provide for me and my
                         yet to be conceived offspring! 
                         It's, like, a caveman thing!

                                   TED
                         So that's a maybe?

                                   CHRISTY
                         The answer is NEVER, Ted, NEVER.
                         Except maybe in your dreams.

               Christy flees. Leaving Ted kneeling there. Alone. Unless you
               count the hoards of STUDENTS who are watching and LAUGHING
               HYSTERICALLY. 

                                   TED
                         In my dreams.  Of course.
                             (repeating; chanting)
                         This is a dream.  This is only a
                         dream.

               Julie approaches.  Gives him a hand.  Helps him up.

                                   JULIE
                         No, Ted.  This is an actual
                         emergency.

               INT. TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - MEN'S ROOM - DAY

               Ted pukes in the sink. 

                                   JULIE
                         I tried to warn you, William
                         Randolph. She's got stiletto heels
                         hidden in those Keds.

                                   TED
                         But you triple-dog-dared me. 

                                   JULIE
                         It was for your own good, in a
                         twisted sort of publicly
                         humiliating way.

                                   CHARLIE
                         One word, my friend. One word.
                         MEATLOAF.

               Ted lifts his head.  Looks in the mirror.  Distraught.

                                   TED
                         There's gotta be more to life than
                         meatloaf.

               INT. THE NELSON KITCHEN - EVENING

               Not a hair above middle class. Home sweet home nonetheless.
               Dinner in progress. MOM, DAD, Ted, younger brother, JIMMY. A
               mutt named CORKY curled under the table. A storm brews.
               Lightning in the distance. Thunder RUMBLES.

               Ted's Mom observes her son with unmistakable Mom-radar. She
               slides a slab of - rotten timing! - MEAT LOAF onto his plate
               with an unpleasant thud. Ted shudders...

                                   TED
                         If I never eat another bite of meat
                         loaf again, it'll be too soon.

               Ted's Mom frowns. Jimmy explains matter-of-factly.

                         Mom, Dad. Meatloaf has come to
                         represent all that Ted hates about
                         his mediocre life and the world we
                         live in. He's what you'd call
                         clinically bummed.

                         stroganoff or even a little London
                         broil? I mean, for god's sake, we
                         own a grocery store!

               Ted's parents look at one another, shake their heads. His Dad
               gently explains...

                         We heard about Christy, son.

               Jimmy tries to stifle a grin.

                                   TED
                         What is this? Does everybody know

                         every freakin' minute of the day?

                         disturbing behavior to furrow your
                         collective brow. Ted's just
                         experiencing some post-adolescent

                         worst day of my seventeen and a
                         half years. And then it happened.

               Ted bursts outside and plows straight into MARTY ZUKERMAN, a
               short, rotund man in his mid-50s.

                                   TED
                         Whoa! Sorry, mister.

               Zukerman's briefcase and papers are knocked to the ground.
               Ted helps to retrieve them.

                         In a hurry, are we?

                         I was in the middle of a
                         melodramatic exit. It wouldn't
                         really make a statement if I
                         tiptoed out the door...What are you
                         selling?

                                   ZUKERMAN
                         Bad news.

                                   TED
                         People pay good money for that?

                                   ZUKERMAN
                         I'm just a messenger.

               Ted starts to back away. Instinctively knowing the bad news
               must be for him.

                                   TED
                         Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad
                         news I can take for one day.

                                   ZUKERMAN
                         It's about your parents.

               Ted stops. Puzzled.

                                   TED
                         My parents? What do you mean?

                                   ZUKERMAN
                         I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm
                         a blurter. Your parents...They
                         ...well...they exist no further.
                             (off Ted's confusion)
                         Skinny-dipping. The Amazon.
                         Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.

                                   TED
                         You've got the wrong guy. The
                         closest my parents have been to the
                         Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at
                         Epcot.

                                   ZUKERMAN
                         Well kid, I'm speaking of...your
                         biological parents.

               INT. NELSON LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Ted sits on the couch, bewildered. Dad beside him. Mom pours
               coffee in her best china.  Zukerman regards a wall of family
               photos as he takes a sip.

                                   ZUKERMAN
                         The will reading is next Tuesday.
                         Naturally all of Ted's expenses
                         will be taken care of. 

               Ted's parents look worried. Mom reminds Dad...

                                   MOM
                         We have a truckload of strawberries
                         arriving on Tuesday morning.

                                   DAD
                             (explaining to Zukerman)
                         We own a small family grocery
                         store.

                                   ZUKERMAN
                         How quaint.

                                   TED
                             (quietly; moping)
                         It's spring break. I don't want to
                         go to a will reading.

                                   MOM
                         That's part of growing up, honey.

                                   TED
                         What? Having spring break ruined by
                         will readings?

                                   DAD
                         You know what your mother means.

                                   ZUKERMAN
                         All right, I can give you two
                         tickets, prepaid, but you must be
                         there. There's no other way.

                                   JIMMY
                         Mom, Dad. Allow me to accompany
                         Ted. I can assure you, I'll be the
                         level-headed sidekick to your angst
                         ridden teen.

                                   DAD
                         I think Ted should take someone
                         older, more responsible.

                                   MOM
                         What about Charlie?  You boys could
                         make it a little adventure.

                                   TED
                         Charlie, at a will reading? What
                         did I do to deserve this?

               Lightning strikes again.  Thunder rumbles a second later. 
               The lights flicker. And it's PITCH BLACK.

               INT. TED'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Candles light the dark room. Rain pours hard outside.
               Journalism mementos all over Ted's walls. News clippings.
               Magazine covers. There's even a faux Pulitzer, a Christmas
               gift from his parents.

               Ted's Dad sits on the edge of his bed.

                                   DAD
                         I remember spring break of my
                         senior year.  Seems like a lifetime
                         ago.

                                   TED
                         Dad, please.

                                   DAD
                         Grandpa was so strong back then.
                         Working from the crack of dawn. So
                         proud of his peaches.

                                   TED
                         Remember how you struggled through
                         that whole facts of life talk and
                         then found out I knew more than
                         you?

                                   DAD
                         You're way ahead of me again?

                                   TED
                             (proving it...)
                         It was the year of the rhizopus
                         rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm.
                         You sacrificed your dream to go to
                         the prize hog festival. And in the
                         end you saved the peaches and you
                         didn't have to slaughter your sow.

                                   DAD
                         The lesson being?

                                   TED
                         Sometimes you have to do stuff you
                         don't want to do. It's all part of
                         growing up. And it usually works
                         out peachy in the end.

                                   DAD
                         I'm getting so good at this.

               Dad chuckles, but Ted's still moping.

                                   TED
                         You guys are my parents.

                                   DAD
                         Of course we are.

                                   TED
                         They didn't want me when I was
                         born. Why should I care...

               ...if they're dead.

                                   DAD
                         Son.

                                   TED
                         Well, why should I?

                                   DAD
                         They had a rough life. Your father
                         was a bouncer.
                         Your mother was, well, a two-bit
                         stripper. There was no place for a
                         baby.

                                   TED
                         I guess.

                                   DAD
                         They did do one great thing. They
                         gave us our boy.

                                   TED
                         Yeah.

                                   DAD
                         Be a sport. How bad could spring
                         break in Los Angeles be?

                                   TED
                         I guess we could go to Disneyland
                         or something.

                                   DAD
                         Think of it as a rite of passage to
                         manhood.

                                   TED
                         Like one of those "National
                         Geographic" specials with the
                         topless chicks?

                                   DAD
                         Whatever helps you cope.

                                   TED
                         I guess it's better than having
                         tribal patterns carved in my face.

                                   DAD
                         There ya go. Always remember, focus
                         on the peach...

                                   TED
                         ...not the pit.

               Ted's Dad hugs him briefly, laughing...

                                   DAD
                         Always one step ahead of your dear
                         old dad.

               Ted and Charlie exit the plane. They walk tentatively through
               the sleeve towards the entry gate.

                                   CHARLIE
                         I wonder if this is what it feels
                         like to be born?

               Ted gives him a look.

                                   CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                         Think about it...Long tunnel,

                         Seriously, it's like we're being
                         reborn. We really could reinvent
                         ourselves here, just like you said.
                         Nobody knows about your massive

               Charlie's words echo loudly through the sleeve...

                         ...EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU'RE A VIRGIN!

               People stare at Ted as they pass.

                                   TED
                         I think I'll reinvent a new best

               Ted and Charlie enter the terminal.  Friends and family wait
               for loved ones.  A few chauffeurs hold signs with names.  One
               stands out.  Tall. Blonde. Gorgeous. In a short skirt. A
               matching low cut jacket.  And a cap.  She's stunning.  And
               she's holding a sign that reads: TED NELSON.

                                   CHARLIE
                         What are the odds of there being
                         ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight? 

                                   TED
                         Astronomical.

               They grin at one another. Then approach the Chauffeur.

                         Hi, I'm Ted Nelson.

               With a sad look, the Chauffeur hugs him, kissing one cheek,
               then the other.

                                   CHAUFFEUR
                         I'm so terribly sorry for your
                         loss. Your father was a great man.

               Ted's stunned. Charlie leans in and whispers.

                                   CHARLIE
                         Who the hell was your father?

               Ted and Charlie sit on opposites ends of the plush interior.
               Charlie eyes the control console with its slew of gadgets.
               They practically have to shout to hear one another.

                                   CHARLIE
                         ...A bouncer? Are you serious?

                                   TED
                         Maybe he got promoted.

               Charlie continues playing with the console switches.

                                   TED (CONT'D)
                         Don't. Touch. Anything.

               Too late.  Rock music pulsates through the limo.

                                   CHARLIE
                             (shouting)
                         This is the life, baby. We get
                         ourselves some tail and we're
                         talking SPRING BREAK!

                                   TED
                         Cut it out, before you break
                         something!

                                   CHARLIE
                         For a guy about to try his first
                         Dom Perignon, you are extremely
                         uptight.

               He flips another switch.  The bar opens.  Revealing a bottle
               of Dom Perignon on ice. Charlie grins broadly.

                                   TED
                         We can't afford that!

               Charlie grabs the bottle and starts to open it.

                                   CHARLIE
                         Don't you know anything about limo
                         etiquette? Everything in here is
                         included for our pleasure.

                                   TED
                         Wait a second, I thought we were
                         hamburger guys.

                                   CHARLIE
                         And like every hamburger guy knows,
                         when you get your one big chance at
                         the good life, you abuse every
                         second of it until they figure out
                         you don't belong there and kick
                         your sorry ass out. 

               POP! The cork flies through the air.  Bounces off the
               ceiling.  And hits another switch.  The sun roof glides open. 
               Champagne overflows from the bottle.  All over Charlie's
               crotch.

                                   TED
                         Nice. Is that in the limo etiquette
                         handbook, too?

               Charlie grabs a bar towel as Ted looks toward the sun roof. 
               Beautifully blue Southern California sky greets him.  With an
               occasional palm tree swooshing by.  Ted rises.

               EXT. LIMO - DAY - MOVING

               Ted's head peeks out of the sun roof. Tentatively. Unsure. He
               takes in the sights as the limo cruises Sunset Boulevard. 
               People stare at him. A beautiful BLONDE smiles and waves. He
               waves back, very timidly.

               Charlie sticks his head out, too. Sun on their faces. Wind in
               their hair. 

                                   CHARLIE
                         This is how the other half lives,
                         bro. Enjoy it while you can. 

               EXT. ENTRY GATE - DAY

               The limo passes through the ornate gate of what could only be
               a sprawling mansion. It comes to a sudden halt. The door
               swings open to reveal a group of BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMEN. Clad
               in very short black dresses and even some black bikinis.  Sad
               expressions on their faces. 

               EXT. LIMO - DAY

               The MOURNERS embrace Ted. 

                                   BEAUTIFUL MOURNER #1
                         Welcome, Mr. Nelson. You are so
                         very very welcome here.

                                   BEAUTIFUL MOURNER #2
                         We feel your pain, so deeply.

                                   CHARLIE
                             (to Ted)
                         Something tells me we're not in
                         Xenia anymore, Toto.

               EXT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - DAY

               The beautiful young women guide Ted towards the mansion.

               Charlie follows. A particularly VOLUPTUOUS BEAUTY eyes him
               curiously.

                                   CHARLIE
                         I'm Charles. The handsome, devoted
                         best friend. We're so close, we
                         feel each other's pain.

               The voluptuous beauty notices Charlie's soaked crotch. He
               winks...

                                   CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                         See what you do to me, baby. 

               Just then, the spry HELEN McDOLE, 60s, emerges from the
               mansion.  She approaches Ted and hugs him.

                                   HELEN
                         Oh my, he would have been so proud. 
                         You're the spitting image of him.

                                   CHARLIE
                         He never spits, ma'am. Ever. He
                         can't even get a good hocker going.
                         I've tried to teach him. It comes
                         from the diaphragm.

                                   TED
                             (sharply; to Charlie)
                         You're on the next plane home.

                                   HELEN
                             (emotional embrace)
                         I'm Helen McDole.  Your father's
                         executive secretary.

               INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

               Ted takes a seat at the spacious conference table.  Helen
               sits on his right. Charlie sits on his left.  

               Zukerman and two other IMPATIENT ATTORNEYS wait at the head
               of the table.  Finally Zukerman checks his watch and rises.

                                   ZUKERMAN
                         We're running out of time. The
                         kid's here. We don't need HIM.

                                   HELEN
                         Perhaps we could be patient for
                         just a moment or two longer?

               They all watch a WALL CLOCK. Seconds pass, slowly, slowly.
               Then suddenly Zukerman rises.

                                   ZUKERMAN
                         What did the doctor say to the
                         nurse as they watched something
                         black and white and red in a
                         blender?
                             (a wry smile)
                         No more patients.

               Very dramatically, Zukerman slides a copy of "Heaven"
               magazine down the conference table. Right to Ted.

                                   ZUKERMAN (CONT'D)
                         Are you familiar with "Heaven?"

                                   TED
                         I'm seventeen. I know it like the
                         back of my hand.

                                   ZUKERMAN
                         Your fathered owned the entire
                         "Heaven" empire.  You own it now.
                         Any questions?

               Ted's stunned, speechless. Charlie gawks.

                                   CHARLIE
                         Everything?  The publishing
                         division, the real estate holdings,
                         the retail outlets, the theme
                         parks?

                                   ZUKERMAN
                         As far as the eye can see.

               Zukerman presses a remote control.  A wall panel slides open
               to reveal a large monitor which springs to life.  On the
               screen is a striking couple.  Ted'S BIOLOGICAL PARENTS. 
               HEATHER and TOM DEEDS. Heather, stunningly sexy and
               overflowing from her gold sequined halter top. Tom, very
               handsome in a Vegas showman sort of way.

                                   HEATHER
                         Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be
                         right there to hug the living
                         daylights out of you!

                                   TOM
                         But if you're watching this, then
                         it means we bit the dust.

                                   HEATHER
                         But don't worry...we'll be in
                         heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean.
                         Not that heaven is an actual place,
                         but more like a state of being. Or
                         not being. Who knows. Maybe we know
                         now.

                                   TOM
                         If you're anything like yours
                         truly, then you probably figure we
                         didn't want you when you were born,
                         so who cares if we're dead? Am I
                         right?

               Ted looks guilty. This is too weird.

                                   HEATHER
                         But we did want you. It's just that
                         you don't always get to keep what
                         you want. We knew you needed a real
                         mom and dad.

                                   TOM
                         We had no idea the nudie magazine
                         we started in the garage would turn
                         into all this.

               Heather holds up the first issue of "Heaven." She's on the
               cover, wearing nothing but a halo. She looks almost exactly
               the same today, with a few extra nips and tucks.

                                   HEATHER
                         Can you believe that was me?

                                   TOM
                         Before we knew it, we created the
                         most popular men's magazine in the
                         entire nation. The rest is history.

                                   HEATHER
                         So here we are. Dead. But we never
                         want you to want for anything. That
                         is, we want you to have everything.

                                   TOM
                         Everything.

               Heather leans forward and blows a kiss into the camera. Her
               strongest assets spilling forward.

                                   HEATHER
                         We love you, Ted. We always did. We
                         always will.

               Charlie's practically slobbering. He elbows Ted.

                                   CHARLIE
                         I can't believe that's your mother.
                         We're talking babe-a-licious chub
                         fest, right here in the 501's.

                                   TED
                         Perv.

               At that moment, the doors burst open. WILLIAM G. DEEDS (UNCLE
               BILLY) sails into the room.  Handsome in an unconventional
               way, he exudes passion and eccentricity.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         I'm so terribly sorry.  Am I too
                         late?

                                   ZUKERMAN
                         Ah, Mr. Deeds. You're just in time
                         to congratulate your nephew. He
                         inherited the empire.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                             (a broad smile)
                         Every morsel of it?

                                   ZUKERMAN
                         It would appear so.

               Uncle Billy hugs Ted with great enthusiasm.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         Smashing!  Welcome to the family,
                         Ted. You are going to breathe some

                         going to set the world on fire! You
                         are going to...call me Uncle Billy?

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         I have only one concern...

               Ted waits. Swept up by Uncle Billy's spirit.

                                   UNCLE BILLY (CONT'D)
                         You do like girls, don't you?

                         Of course I like girls.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         A lot? I mean, a whole lot?

                                   CHARLIE
                             (to the rescue)
                         He likes them with the unbridled
                         enthusiasm of a seventeen-year-old
                         virgin who's been making mental
                         beef jerky since he saw the bevy of
                         tender young skirt steaks at his
                         new hacienda.

               Uncle Billy grins broadly.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         That's my boy!

               INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Uncle Billy leads Ted and Charlie through the cavernous room.
               Sexy, semi-clad oil paintings of Ted's biological mother
               adorn the walls.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         The parties are held in here when
                         the weather dips below seventy.
                         Which is seldom.

                                   TED
                         Seldom? No kidding?

                                   CHARLIE
                         You said parties but you meant
                         ORGIES, right?
                             (to Ted; quietly)
                         Stick with me. I know their codes.

               Uncle Billy winks at Ted.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         The orgies, exactly. Take a deep
                         breath. You can smell it. Pure
                         sexuality, oozing from the walls.

               Charlie takes a deep breath. Uncle Billy and Ted share a
               conspiratorial smirk.

               INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - GAME ROOM - DAY

               The epitome of every boy's dream arcade.  Everything from
               classic pinball machines to the most high tech virtual
               reality game that has yet to hit the market.  Charlie shakes
               his head in amazement.

                                   CHARLIE
                         Naked girls, wild sex, video games.
                         No wonder it's called "Heaven."

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         This is a fun place...but we don't
                         usually come here until after the
                         orgies.

                                   TED
                             (playing along)
                         Ah, in other words, this is the
                         apres-orgy salon?

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         Indeed it is. During the day,
                         visitors prefer to be outside, au
                         naturel. As it were.

               Charlie continues to gawk. Ted's equally impressed but
               holding it together.

               INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - SWIMMING ROOM - DAY

               Uncle Billy leads Ted and Charlie by the indoor pool which is
               decorated like a tropical pond, complete with exotic
               vegetation, lava rocks, and a waterfall.  They pass through a
               cave-like entrance and find themselves...

               EXT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - SWIMMING POOL - DAY

               ...coming out by another spectacular waterfall. Which
               separates the indoor and outdoor pools. Numerous BEAUTIFUL
               WOMEN swim, chat, play water polo. Some topless, some might
               as well be.  The boys watch in awe as one woman rubs lotion
               on another woman's back.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         Hello, girls! Have you met Ted?

               The women wave, ad-libbing warm greetings. Charlie leans
               towards Ted, confiding...

                                   CHARLIE
                         This is like my every wet dream
                         come true.  I don't even care that
                         you're here, too, bro. 

                                   TED
                         Be cool. Fake it if you have to. 

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         Good advice, Ted. You have your
                         father's instincts.

               "His father." The words sound so strange. He never even met
               the guy.

                                   UNCLE BILLY (CONT'D)
                         Just remember, you're not the man
                         you were a day ago. And these
                         girls, let's just say they'd be
                         eager to please you.

               Ted gulps. It's hard to believe this is real.

                                   CHARLIE
                         I wonder how many of them will be
                         at the orgy tonight?

                                   TED
                         This isn't some 80's porno film,
                         you dip shit. There are no wild sex
                         orgies.

                                   CHARLIE
                         Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.

                                   TED
                         Not ever. Never.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         Never say never.

                                   CHARLIE
                         Oh, god.  Look. Look.

               Ted looks.  A beautiful woman sensuously rubs tanning lotion
               over her OWN breasts.  The boys stare, riveted. 

                                   CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                         I really love your peaches, wanna
                         shake your tree.

                Uncle Billy grins.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         Maybe she needs help, Ted. You
                         should be a gentleman.

                                   TED
                             (voice cracking)
                         I...uh...I think she's doing fine
                         on her own.

                                   CHARLIE
                             (having a moment)
                         Oh baby, yes, yes, yes. Fuck me
                         like you mean it. 

               Ted elbows Charlie out of his fantasy.

                                   TED
                         You kiss your mother with that
                         mouth?

                                   CHARLIE
                         I'd kiss your mother with this
                         mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you
                         know...

               He means dead.

                                   TED
                         So far away? In Xenia?

                                   CHARLIE
                         Yeah, whatever.

               INT.  THE NELSON HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Mom waits nervously for the phone to ring.

                                   MOM
                         Teddy? Is that you?

               Dad hurries out of the bathroom, hiking up his pajamas. Mom
               speaks loudly, as if Ted's in Siberia.

                                   MOM (CONT'D)
                         How are you, baby? Are you all
                         right?

                                                       INTERCUT WITH:

               INT. TED'S BEDROOM - "HEAVEN" MANSION - NIGHT

               A palatial suite. Very Louis XIV.  Ted throws a sheet over a
               nude sculpture of his biological mother. While holding a
               cordless phone in the crook of his neck.

                                   TED
                         I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in
                         Siberia, you know.

                                   MOM
                         Did you have a nice flight?  Are
                         they taking good care of you?

                                   TED
                         Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so
                         much to tell you.  I don't even
                         know where to begin.

                                   MOM
                         Save it, honey.  We want to hear
                         every detail when you get back, but
                         we don't want you to run up Mr.
                         Zukerman's phone bill.

                                   TED
                         It's okay, Mom.  Trust me.

               Mom hands Dad the phone.

                                   DAD
                         Ted, it's your dad.  I have a
                         question for you.  I don't know how
                         to put it tactfully. You know I'm
                         lousy with words.

                                   TED
                         Just say it, Dad.

                                   DAD
                         I know they were simple people, but
                         did this trip help your college
                         fund at all?

                                   TED
                         Dad, let's just say I can buy
                         anything I want in the whole
                         bookstore. Including the bookstore. 

                                   DAD
                             (not getting it)
                         Well, good. Every little bit helps.

               Suddenly, Charlie bursts into the room with a pair of
               binoculars.

                                   CHARLIE
                         Check this out.  Hurry!

                                   TED
                         I better go, Dad. 

                                   DAD
                         We'll see you soon.  Have fun in...
                             (trying to be hip)
                         ...the land of fruits and nuts.

               INT. TED'S BEDROOM - "HEAVEN" MANSION - NIGHT

               Charlie flips off the light switch and whispers...

                                   CHARLIE
                         Hurry.

                             (to Charlie)
                         What is it now?

                         Check it out! 

               Charlie shoves the binoculars at Ted and guides him toward
               the window which overlooks the outdoor pool.

                                   TED
                         Don't tell me.  Another vision of
                         incomparable beauty?

                                   CHARLIE
                         Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.

               TED'S POV THROUGH BINOCULARS

               A devastatingly PERFECT WOMAN, GINGER, "Miss April,"  emerges
               from the pool, wearing nothing but a g-string. Her skin
               shimmers from the reflection of the pool lights. Rivulets of
               water stream down her body.  She reaches for a towel and pats
               her body dry. An incredible aura seems to surround her. 
               Separating her from the other spectacular beauties we've seen
               already.

               Ted lowers the binoculars. Entranced.

                                   TED
                         I get it now. You and me. We're
                         dead.

                                   CHARLIE
                         Dead?

                                   TED
                         Our plane crashed. In the Grand
                         Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We
                         never made it to L.A. They needed
                         dental records to identify us. And
                         this place. This. Actually. Is.
                         Heaven.

                                   CHARLIE
                         Then there must be a whole room,
                         made completely of chocolate.

                                   TED
                         And some really fast cars.

               INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Ted and Charlie move like thieves in the night.

                                   CHARLIE
                         Don't be such a pansy. All of this
                         is YOURS.

                                   TED
                         It's a lot to digest. Imagine how
                         you'd feel.

                                   CHARLIE
                         I'd feel like staying up all night!
                         Forever! Or at least till I got the
                         LAY of the land, SO TO SPEAK.

               INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Ted and Charlie enter.  Flip the light switch.  It was his
               parents' very opulent bedroom. Complete with more risqué
               paintings of Ted's biological mother.

                                   TED
                         I feel like I'm entering a
                         forbidden tomb...

                                   CHARLIE
                         ...where they get all the really
                         good porno channels on cable. 

               Charlie pulls open a dresser drawer filled with Ted's
               mother's lingerie.

                                   CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                         Cha-ching. Jackpot.

               Charlie caresses a pair of red silk panties and inhales their
               powdery fragrance.  

                                   TED
                         Oh, how inappropriate is that!

                                   CHARLIE
                         Take a whiff of heaven.

                                   TED
                         How would you like it if I did that
                         to your mother's panties?

                                   CHARLIE
                         I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. 
                         But this is different.  She wasn't
                         your mother mother--

                                   TED
                         Give me those!

               Ted grabs the panties just as Charlie pulls away, ripping
               them in half. Just then the door opens to reveal a very
               proper ENGLISH BUTLER.

                                   BUTLER
                         I do apologize, sir. I heard a
                         noise.

               Ted and Charlie awkwardly hide the panty halves behind their
               backs.

                                   TED
                         We were just--

                                   BUTLER
                         --I completely understand, sir.
                         I'll leave you to your business.
                         Good night.

               The Butler leaves.  Ted glares at Charlie. Who shrugs.

                                   CHARLIE
                         A couple of boys fighting over a
                         pair of red silk panties is nothing
                         compared to what he's seen.

                                   TED
                             (sarcastic)
                         Yeah, he's probably been serving
                         cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the
                         orgies.

               INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - GARAGE - THE NEXT MORNING

               The garage is crowded with two dozen sporty classics. Ted
               runs his hands over the hood of a red Ferrari 575M Maranello.
               He pulls the door open and slides into the leather seat.

                                   GINGER (O.S.)
                         Wanna take me for a ride? 

               Ted turns around and spots Ginger, the goddess from the pool,
               making her way towards him.  He gulps.

                                   TED
                         I-I don't have the keys.

                                   GINGER
                         They're in the ignition, silly.

               Ted glances down. There they are. She hops in next to him. 
               He doesn't know what to do.

                                   GINGER (CONT'D)
                         You do know how to drive?

                                   TED
                         I don't have much experience with
                         a...uh...stick.

                                   GINGER
                         Want a lesson?

               Ted blushes. He needs a lot of lessons.

                                   GINGER (CONT'D)
                         Press your left foot on the clutch. 
                         And turn the key.

               The Ferrari growls to life. Ginger places her hand over
               Ted's.

                                   GINGER (CONT'D)
                         Now release the brake. And slide
                         the stick into first gear.

                                   TED
                         Got it.

               Ginger moves her slender fingers on his knees. Showing him
               how it's done.

                                   GINGER
                         Now very carefully apply some
                         pressure to the gas pedal with your
                         right foot as you release the
                         clutch with your left.

               She squeezes his thigh and winks. 

               EXT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - GARAGE - DAY

               The Ferrari jerks out of the garage and promptly stalls.
               Ginger giggles.  Could Ted be MORE embarrassed?

                                   GINGER
                         The first time can be awkward. You
                         just have to get on and try again.

                                   TED
                         I don't even know if I should be
                         doing this. It's a very expensive
                         car.

                                   GINGER
                         It's your car. These are all your
                         cars.

                                   TED
                         Some of them have to be automatics.

                                   GINGER
                         Your father liked shifting. He said
                         it brought him closer to the
                         engine. "Like a woman, purring with
                         ecstasy."

               Ted feels his temperature rising. He changes the subject.

                                   TED
                         I'm Ted, by the way. I think I
                         forgot to say that.

                                   GINGER
                         I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.

                                   TED
                         The one with the horses.

                                   GINGER
                         That's me.

                                   TED
                         I almost didn't recognize you
                         without...you know...that stallion
                         between...your...uh...legs.

               Ginger blushes.

                                   TED (CONT'D)
                         That sounded so much better in my
                         head. 

               Ginger GIGGLES. Ted tries to hide behind his less than cool
               shades. Ginger notices.

                                   GINGER
                         Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping? 

                                   TED
                         Shopping, really? I should tell my
                         friend.

                                   GINGER
                         Don't worry.  He found the
                         chocolate room.

                                   TED
                             (big grin)
                         Hi ho, Silver.

               He puts the car in gear.  The tires scream as they take off. 
               Gears grind as he shifts. Not exactly purring with ecstasy.
               Yet.

               EXT. BEVERLY HILLS - DAY

               The Ferrari negotiates its way along Rodeo Drive. Ted seems
               to have gotten the hang of it.

               Tourists stare.  One snaps a photo.

               Ted pulls up to...and then over...the curb. Well, he almost
               has the hang of it.

               INT. CLOTHING STORE - DAY

               Ted emerges from a dressing room.  Slowly starting to lose
               his boy-from-Xenia taint.  He glances at the price tag,
               dangling from his sleeve.  His eyes widen. Ginger strokes his
               arm. Whispers seductively in his ear.

                                   GINGER
                         Your father always said, "Money
                         matters only to the man who doesn't
                         have it."

               Ted listens. Trying to learn.

               INT. A CHIC EYEWEAR BOUTIQUE - DAY

               Ted tries on some snazzy sunglasses.  Ginger approves.  Ted
               still checks the price tag.

                                   TED
                         Sorry, habit.

               Ginger looks into his eyes. As if she can see his soul.

                                   GINGER
                         Who exactly ARE you?

                                   TED
                             (uncomfortable)
                         What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.

                                   GINGER
                         And who IS Ted Nelson?

               Ted's not sure how to respond. He smiles awkwardly.

                                   GINGER (CONT'D)
                         Is he a small town boy, destined to
                         live an ordinary life with an
                         ordinary wife and a tiny house with
                         a boring old white picket fence?

               The hamburger life. Now he can defy it.

                                   GINGER  (CONT'D)
                         Or do you have a taste for the good
                         life, Ted? It's in your blood.

                                   TED
                         I always knew there was more. I
                         felt it.

                                   GINGER
                         Then remember, you are the heir to
                         a billion dollar empire. You have a
                         staff of literally thousands.
                         Multiply everything you ever
                         imagined by a million and you still
                         can't even wrap your head around
                         everything that is yours. ALL
                         YOURS.

               Ted slides on the shades. Slowly, purposefully. He grins at
               the SALES CLERK...

                                   TED
                         I'll take the whole case.

               INT. "HEAVEN" HEADQUARTERS - DAY

               Ted, Charlie, Helen, and Uncle Billy walk past GRAPHIC
               DESIGNERS in cubicles as Helen leads a tour of the "Heaven"
               magazine offices. As they pass each cubicle, HEADS pop up to
               check them out.

               "HEAVEN" WAR ROOM

               POLAROIDS OF NAKED WOMEN cover every square inch of wall
               space.  Ted and Charlie gawk.  Who can blame them?

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         Every one of these women thinks she
                         should be the next Angel of the
                         Month. It's your job, Ted, to
                         decide which of them is right.

                                   CHARLIE
                         Let me get this straight...

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         If it isn't straight by now, son,
                         you probably should see a doctor.

                                   CHARLIE
                         These are real, live women?

                         We don't generally feature blow-up
                         dolls in our magazine. But hey, if
                         you think there's a market for it.

                                   CHARLIE
                         God, I love being dead.

               Ted focuses on one particular picture. He removes the push
               pin that holds it to the wall.

                                   TED
                         I like her.

               We can see the concerned look on Helen's face. Does this kid
               have any taste at all?

                                   HELEN
                             (relieved)
                         Nice choice. There's only one
                         problem.

               She shows Uncle Billy.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         You think she upgraded?

                         They went in through the belly
                         button.

               Uncle Billy nods. He explains gently...

                         TIPN. Tattoos, implants, piercings,
                         nose jobs. Our angels must be pure,
                         unadultered, completely natural.

               Ted looks at the walls again. Carefully. He has a knack for
               this. He hands a picture to Helen. She turns to Uncle Billy
               and smiles.

                                   HELEN (CONT'D)
                             (emotional)
                         You have your father's eye.

               His father. He just can't get used to that. Who was this guy?

               INT. MASTER BEDROOM CLOSET - "HEAVEN" MANSION - NIGHT

               Ted looks at the impressive collection of suits. Runs his
               hands along the fabrics. Picks a particularly stylish jacket
               and tries it on. It fits poorly. Too big in the chest and
               shoulders. Ted looks at himself in the full-length mirror.
               He's not half the man his father was.

               Suddenly there's a KNOCK on the door. Ted quickly takes off
               his father's jacket and puts on his own. He lets Uncle Billy
               in.  LOUD PARTY SOUNDS momentarily pour into the room.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         There you are, Ted-baby. Everything
                         all right?

                                   TED
                         Yeah.  Everything's cool.

               Ted's struggling with a silk tie. Uncle Billy helps him.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         You ready for your big coming out
                         party? Everybody's dying to meet
                         you.

                                   TED
                         Just a couple of finishing touches.
                         My parents always said you never
                         get a second chance to make a good
                         first impression.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                             (puzzled)
                         They said that? Really?
                             (realizing)
                         Oh, your parents. The Nelson's.
                         Right, right. How midwest. I like
                         that.

               Ted wipes his palms on his slacks. Confiding...

                                   TED
                         Truth is, I'm a little nervous.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should
                         you be nervous?

                                   TED
                         All those people out there. It's a
                         lot of pressure.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         Huh! You laugh in the face of
                         pressure!

                                   TED
                         I do?

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         You are a multi-media magnate. The
                         Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of 
                         Bottoms.

               Ted chuckles. Uncle Billy's calming him...

                                   UNCLE BILLY CONT'D)
                         You are the Emperor of every little
                         girl who dreamed of growing up to
                         see her naughty bits spread eagle,
                         airbrushed to glossy perfection,
                         with staples through her ass.

               Uncle Billy rubs his shoulders. As if pep-talking him for a
               big fight.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         You're the Sultan of Semen. The
                         Monarch of Masturbation. The
                         Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted.
                         Are the King of Coitus.

                                   TED
                         Me? The King of Coitus?

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.

                                   TED
                         Whoa. But...that's the thing...
                             (he whispers)
                         I've never even actually...

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                             (interrupting)
                         Why, look who's here.

               Uncle Billy swings the door open to reveal. KIKI and KELLY.
               Tall, beautiful, leggy IDENTICAL TWINS.  They smile warmly at
               Ted, each offering an arm.  Ted holds his head high. Like the
               Sovereign of Sexuality.

               LONG DRAMATIC STAIRCASE

               With the twins on either side of him, Ted struts down the
               stairs and into a sea of people.  All so eager to meet him. 
               Ted acts as if he's been doing this all his life.

                                   TED
                             (sotto)
                         The Potentate of Poon has arrived.

               And instantly, he's surrounded.  People shake his hands. 
               Women kiss his cheeks.  Athletes, movie stars, models. 
               Charlie watches, beaming proudly.

               DANCE FLOOR - LATER

               Charlie thinks he's Travolta. Dressed for disco. Twirling a
               Super Model. Ted dances among a dozen BEAUTIES.  They steal
               kisses and hugs, here and there. A thousand Cinderellas, all
               after one Prince Charming.  Ted's having the time of his
               life. Charlie dances up to him. Shouting in his ear...

                                   CHARLIE
                         Ain't life amazing? A week ago, you
                         couldn't get to second base!  Now
                         you OWN second base!

               They high-five one another. An EXOTIC BEAUTY grabs Ted and
               starts dirty dancing. Rubbing herself against him.  Ted's
               clueless. So he improvises.  People cheer him on.  He thrusts
               his pelvis. Feigns various sex acts. Hilarious, goofy, but it
               works.

               EXT. JACUZZI - NIGHT

               The party's over.  Ted relaxes in the Jacuzzi, sipping
               champagne. Thrilled, elated, blasted.  Uncle Billy sits
               across from him.  Two MASSEUSES tenderize their shoulders.
               But as the scene continues the women take an even greater
               interest in each other. Stealing a kiss here. A touch there. 
               Ted attention is distracted as he chats with Uncle Billy.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         I told you you could do it.

                                   TED
                         I was like a different person
                         tonight.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         You were the new and improved you.

                                   TED
                         I would have been laughed right out
                         of Xenia.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         No one will be laughing at you now,
                         Ted. You can take that to the bank.

                                   TED
                         It's really going to be strange
                         going home in a couple of days.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         You ARE home. But go ahead, finish
                         school, do what you feel you need
                         to do. In the meantime, I'll be
                         your point person here on the
                         magazine.

                                   TED
                         Really? You'd do that for me?

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         I've been very lazy for a long,
                         long time.

                                   TED
                         You seem like you're anything but
                         lazy, Uncle Billy.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                             (confiding)
                         I never finished school myself.
                         Never had to. My brother built this
                         empire from nothing but his wife's
                         perky tits and a whole lot of
                         gumption. He gave me a cushy job on
                         a silver platter. I never struggled
                         for a second.

                                   TED
                         My parents always say hard work
                         builds character.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         It's not like I didn't have ideas,
                         I had plenty of ideas. But I never
                         even shared them with your father.
                         Never had the guts.

                                   TED
                         What kind of ideas?

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         Well...for one thing...I think it's
                         despicable that we exclude so many
                         women that only fit our western
                         notion of "classic beauty."

                                   TED
                         You think we should be more open
                         minded?

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         The world is a big, beautiful
                         place.  We can open new markets in
                         Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali
                         Lhama reading our magazine.

                                   TED
                         In other words, our scope is too
                         narrow.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         At our press conference tomorrow, I
                         think we should announce our plans
                         to explore the world. Not just a
                         few leggy 36D's, with blond hair
                         upstairs and down.

                                   TED
                         That's perfect.

               The Masseuses help Uncle Billy out of the Jacuzzi. They say
               their goodnights and Ted closes his eyes. When he opens them,
               Ginger stands at the edge of the tub.

                                   GINGER
                         Want some company?

               Ted can barely nod. She unzips the back of her dress and lets
               it fall to her feet.  The silhouette of her nude body is
               startlingly gorgeous in the moonlight. Ted watches as she
               descends, step by step, into the frothy water.

               Ted's paralyzed with desire and fear. Ginger descends deeper. 
               A wash of foam caresses her breasts.  She continues.  Until
               she's completely submerged.

               Ted looks startled.  The "Jaws" theme echoes through his
               ears.  He starts to rise. Concerned. When suddenly, he feels
               something.  Whoa! His swimming trunks land next to him.

               He starts to rise out of the Jacuzzi, when suddenly he's
               sucked under.  He thrashes.  His hand grabs the edge of the
               Jacuzzi. But his fingers give out.  And he slides under. Only
               to rise out of the water with Ginger. Attached to his lips.
               Kissing him passionately.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - TED'S BEDROOM - MORNING

               Ted and Ginger in bed.  Morning rays, satin sheets, what a
               night.  Ted awakens.  He stares at Ginger in awe, remembering
               what happened. Smiles big.

               Ted slides out of bed.  Catches his reflection in the mirror. 
               Takes a good look at himself.

               Press Conference. Lights, cameras, reporters, bedlam. Uncle
               Billy, Helen, and Ted sit at a makeshift dais.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         ...My brilliant, extraordinary
                         nephew, Ted Nelson, has brought
                         enough fresh blood to this company
                         to make all of Transylvania happy
                         for the next fifty or sixty years.
                         I'll give him the mike now and
                         you'll see what I mean. This apple
                         didn't fall far from the tree.

               Ted prepares to speak. A little nervous from the spotlights,
               but hell, he's a man now. Uncle Billy gives him a reassuring
               look.

                         of the high school paper in Xenia,
                         Ohio. I've won some awards, made a
                         difference.
                         I've always had journalism in my
                         soul. Now I know why.

                         taste in women and cars.

               CHUCKLES from the crowd. Uncle Billy gives him a "thumb's up"
               sign.

                         the challenge of bringing "Heaven"
                         magazine into the 21st century.

               Ted's parents and little Jimmy stare in amazement at their
               old-fashioned console RCA.  A geeky high school picture of
               Ted appears on screen, as a REPORTER babbles...

                         The big question now remains: Will
                         success spoil Ted Nelson, the
                         straight-A journalism student from
                         Xenia, Ohio, whose life was
                         transformed overnight when he found
                         out he was rich, powerful, and
                         certainly the most eligible
                         bachelor in the entire nation?

                         Mom, Dad. Forget about roller
                         blades for my birthday. I'd prefer
                         a DNA test. Can you prove beyond a
                         shadow of a doubt that I am not,
                         for example, a Guccione?

               The door bell CHIMES. Mom and Dad look at each other. This
               can't be good.

                         Dad opens the front door to reveal
                         a delivery man, holding a flashy
                         new bike.

                                   DELIVERYMAN
                         Delivery for Jimmy Nelson.

               EXT. NELSON HOUSE - DAY

               Jimmy squeezes past Dad and jumps on the bike as Mom appears
               in the doorway.

                                   MOM
                         My goodness, who sent this?

                                   DELIVERY MAN
                         It's from "Heaven," ma'am.

                                   DAD
                         Ted. Of course.

                                   JIMMY
                             (riding around)
                         I love you, Ted!

                                   MOM
                         We can't accept it.  It's much too
                         expensive. Right, dear?

                                   DAD
                         Of course, dumpling. Its very nice
                         of Ted but...

               At that moment, ANOTHER DELIVERY MAN and his HELPER unload a
               large crate from another truck. They approach Dad and Mom.

                                   DELIVERY MAN #2
                         Delivery for Robert Nelson.

                         For me? What is it?

                                   DELIVERY MAN #2
                         Appears to be tools, sir.

                                   MOM
                         Oh, no. Ted's gone completely
                         overboard.

               Dad approaches the crate as the Delivery Man opens it to
               reveal a large scarlet and gray case of tools.  Dad opens one
               of the drawers.  Runs his fingers over the shiny instruments. 
               Tears in his eyes.

                                   MOM (CONT'D)
                         Sweetheart, what is it?

                                   DAD
                         I always wanted Craftsman tools. He
                         even got me the limited edition
                         Buckeye colors.

                                   MOM
                         Oh, honey. We can't accept this
                         extravagance.

               Another delivery truck arrives.  Then the local news vans. 
               Neighbors rush out of their houses. The phone RINGS.  Mom
               dashes inside.

               EXT. TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

               A beautiful spring morning.  Cars pull into the school
               parking lot.  Students mingle in small groups. Making their
               way into the building.  A group of GUYS look up.

               Suddenly, a helicopter swooshes through the air, circling the
               school as if to get everyone's attention, then landing on a
               grassy knoll. The helicopter is painted heavenly blue with a
               pattern of white billowy clouds.

               The door slides open and out hops Ted. In SLOW-MO. Looking
               seriously cool from the tips of his silver toed boots to his
               stylish Persol shades.  Until he takes a second step and
               stumbles slightly, catching himself from falling face first
               into the grass.

               Charlie is right behind him. Looking great, too, but vaguely
               Mafioso in his efforts to be hip. He turns to the beautiful
               blonde PILOT and plants a big wet kiss for everyone to see. 

               Ted and Charlie strut towards the school as Principal Merkin
               bursts through the front doors, shouting...

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN
                         You cannot land a helicopter in my
                         school yard! Get that blasted thing
                         out of here!

               Ted raises his hand.  The chopper rises as if on cue. 
               Without a word, Ted and Charlie pass the ruffled Principal
               Merkin and strut toward the entrance. Classmates surround
               Ted.  Congratulating him.  Everyone wanting to be Ted's new
               best friend.  Julie walks up to Charlie.

                                   JULIE
                         What gives, Don Corleone?

                                   CHARLIE
                             (smug)
                         We reinvented ourselves.

                         New Hushpuppies don't make a new
                         man.

                                   CHARLIE
                         You've obviously never had your
                         dogs nestled in thousand dollar
                         Italian loafers.

                                   JULIE
                         That explains the emptiness that
                         haunts me.

                                   CHARLIE
                         Jealousy is so unattractive.

               Ted makes eye contact with Julie. Winking like he's Don Juan.
               She just stares at him, blankly.

                                   JULIE
                         Second only to unfettered arrogance
                         and the inability to see the irony
                         therein.

               Charlie's baffled by that one. 

                                   CHARLIE
                         Wanna see my hickey from Miss
                         December?

                         Ted, you are the best editor this
                         school paper ever had. You don't
                         need to be pandering flesh. It's
                         nonsense. It's beneath you.

                                   TED
                         You think I ought to just tell them
                         thanks but no thanks? I don't want
                         your silly billion dollar empire?

                         That's a good start, yes. A very
                         good start.

               Principal Merkin opens his desk drawer sheepishly. Caresses
               the watch. It kills him to return it.

                         reminding me.

               INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

               Flurry of activity. Ted on his cell phone. Julie types
               furiously. Taking her job very seriously. Christy Malone
               props one leg against the wall. Demonstrating those
               contortionist warm-up moves that drove Ted mad with desire.

                                   CHRISTY
                         Great jacket, Teddy Bear.

                                   TED
                             (hanging up phone)
                         Yeah? You like?

                                   CHRISTY
                         Makes your shoulders look so big
                         and broad.

                                   JULIE
                         A few billion bucks and suddenly
                         he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year. 

                                   TED
                         It's so nice to have FRIENDS like
                         you, Christy.

               Christy pouts. Wishing she never said the "F" word. Julie
               snickers. Ted takes Julie's arm and guides her to a private
               spot in the corner.

                                   JULIE
                         What is it, William Randolph? Your
                         balls need scratching?

                                   TED
                         Your article sucked.

                                   JULIE
                         In what sense?

                                   TED
                         In the sense that there is no
                         "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale
                         that raised five hundred dollars
                         for seeing eye dogs.

                                   JULIE
                         Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you
                         didn't even know it was there.

                                   TED
                         Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You
                         have some real talent.

                                   JULIE
                         Just because someone died and made
                         you king of the publishing world
                         doesn't mean you're even one ounce
                         smarter than you were a week ago.

                                   TED
                         I'm trying to help.

                                   JULIE
                         I'm still better than you. Nothing
                         changed except the decimal point in
                         your savings account.

                                   TED
                         That's not ENTIRELY true.

               Julie snaps her fingers, as if trying to remember...

                                   JULIE
                         Oh, right. You're probably not a
                         virgin anymore. But as far as being
                         a hack, that much is status quo.

               Ted fumes. She really knows how to push his buttons. 

                                   TED
                         What do you want from me? I'm
                         trying to be fair. But I can't keep
                         you on staff if you turn every PTA
                         meeting into an Agent Orange cover
                         up.

                                   JULIE
                         Then I'll write about YOU.

                                   TED
                         Me?

                                   JULIE
                         "Local boy inherits more money than
                         god." Call me crazy, but I smell
                         human interest.

                                   TED
                             (loving this)
                         Really? You wanna write about me?

               INT. NELSON DINING ROOM - DAY

               A world class CHEF and his SOUS CHEF serve the Nelson's a
               filet mignon dinner. Mom, Dad, Jimmy, Ted, and Julie, sit at
               the table. Set with the finest china. The most elegant
               linens. A fresh floral arrangement. The best of everything.

               Everyone waits for Mom as she takes her first bite.

                                   MOM
                         Goodness...it's delicious. I've
                         never tasted anything so tender.

               The rest of them dig in.

                                   DAD
                         Beats the heck out of meatloaf.
                             (off Mom's look)
                         Although your meatloaf is second to
                         none, love muffin.

               Jimmy's eyes widen as he chews.

                                   JIMMY
                         Mom, Dad. My trembling taste buds
                         have just been assailed by the
                         bittersweet knowledge of all
                         they've been missing these past
                         nine years.

               The chef turns to Julie...

                                   JULIE
                         No offense, Wolfgang Puck, but dead
                         flesh is dead flesh. This just
                         happens to be better than most dead
                         flesh on the planet.

               And finally, the Chef waits for Ted...

                                   TED
                         Absolutely...heavenly.

               The Chef wipes a bead of sweat from his brow. Approval, at
               last, from the only opinion that mattered.

                                   CHEF
                         Why, thank you, sir. Thank you.

                                   JIMMY
                         Ted has bettered our lives to the
                         point where I can no longer see
                         myself as "the old Jimmy" I was but
                         a day or two past. You may all call
                         me James. From this moment forward.

                                   TED
                         Finally, some gratitude.

                                   DAD
                         We're grateful, Ted. It's not that.
                         Those Craftsman tools...they're a
                         dream come true.

                                   MOM
                         Your Dad and I were raised with a
                         certain work ethic, that's all.

               Julie listens closely, admiring Ted's parents.

                                   DAD
                         We can't start living like we're
                         the Rockerfellers or something.

                                   JIMMY
                         Mom, Dad. The Rockerfellers are
                         paupers compared to my favorite
                         brother, Ted.

                                   TED
                         You don't have to work another day
                         in your lives.

                                   MOM
                         But how would we pay our bills?

                                   DAD
                         We just barely have enough for your
                         college tuition, son.

               Ted's frustration mounts.

                                   TED
                         Don't you get it? In one day I earn
                         more interest than the store's
                         entire annual revenue.

                                   MOM
                         Oh. Goodness.

                                   TED
                         You're free.  You can do anything
                         you ever wanted to do!

                                   MOM
                             (after a beat)
                         Like what?

                                   TED
                         Like take that trip to Buckingham
                         Palace. Go deep sea fishing in the
                         Gulf of Mexico. Now's your chance.

                                   DAD
                         But those are our dreams, son. We
                         have to make them come true.

                                   TED
                         Consider me your fairy godfather,
                         except without the fairy part. No
                         more mealy apples and bruised
                         bananas, ever, for the rest of your
                         lives. 

                                   MOM
                         But who would run the store?

                                   TED
                         Forget the store. Think big.

               Dad looks at Mom. Forget the store. That stings.

                                   DAD
                         Ted, we put a lot of love in our
                         business.

                                   MOM
                         We wanted you and Jimmy to have it
                         someday. Something real and honest.

                                   DAD
                         We love our lives just the way they
                         are.

               Disappointed, disgusted, Ted looks to Julie for support.
               Tears fill her eyes. Mom and Dad moved her. Ted shrugs and
               digs into his food.

               EXT. ABOVE THE CLOUDS - DAY

               A heavenly blue jet with billowy white clouds soars through
               the sky.

               INT. THE "HEAVEN" JET - DAY

               Beyond first class; the ultimate in posh. Charlie sweet-talks
               a sexy FLIGHT ATTENDANT.

                                   CHARLIE
                         Call me Charlie. I'm a photographer
                         for "Heaven" magazine. And a very
                         cunning linguist.

               The Flight Attendant pulls him toward the washroom, quickly. 

               Julie interviews Ted, complete with tape recorder. 

                                   TED
                         I have to admit, I always felt...
                         different.

                                   JULIE
                         Different how? Different like a
                         dwarf at a basketball game? Or
                         different like a lesbian in pumps?

                                   TED
                         I don't get the distinction.

                                   JULIE
                         Could everybody else tell you were
                         different, or were you the only one
                         who knew?

                                   TED
                         I felt limited. I felt confined. I
                         felt like I was suffocating.

                                   JULIE
                         I see. So more like a tight rope
                         walker who secretly wants to be a
                         trapeze artist.

                                   TED
                         I guess.

                                   JULIE
                         Interesting.

               Another FLIGHT ATTENDANT approaches...

                                   FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                         Warm peanuts?

                                   TED
                         No thanks. I prefer my penis at
                         room temperature.

                                   JULIE
                         She said peanuts, you cretin.

                                   TED
                         You never know around here.

               Julie raises her eyebrows. Taking notes.

                                   TED (CONT'D)
                         Don't write that part.

                                   JULIE
                         Is this an gritty exposé or a candy
                         ass press release?

                                   TED
                         Write what you want. Just try not
                         to make it so obvious that you're
                         crazy about me.

                                   JULIE

                         Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.

                                   TED
                         Funny you should say "peachy."

                                   JULIE
                         I did my homework. Your grandfather
                         was a peach farmer.

                                   TED
                         My adoptive grandfather. Who knows
                         what my biological grandfather did.

                                   JULIE
                         Undoubtedly an aristocratic
                         bartender of some sort.

               Ted loves her spunk. And the chemistry between them. 

                                   TED
                         Considering this is your first time
                         on a private jet, on which you are
                         interviewing the world's most
                         eligible bachelor,  you are
                         extremely cavalier.

                                   JULIE
                         I bet there are lots and lots of
                         mirrors on Planet Ted.

                                   TED
                         See? You're impertinent, rude,
                         sarcastic.

                                   JULIE
                         And this is not my first time on a
                         private jet, so quit acting like
                         I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.

                                   TED
                         A little respect would be nice,
                         that's all.

               Julie snickers.

                                   JULIE
                         Money can't buy respect, Ted.
                         Saying what you mean. Meaning what
                         you say. Being an honorable person.
                         That's how you earn respect.

               INT. GREEN ROOM - DAY

               Ted waits for his appearance on "The Tonight Show."  Ginger
               smooths out the imaginary creases in Ted's Armani jacket.

                                   GINGER
                         Great jacket, Teddy. It makes your
                         shoulders look so big and broad.

               Julie rolls her eyes. Here we go again.  Uncle Billy and
               Helen look on approvingly.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         You do look smashing.

                                   HELEN
                         Positively dashing.

                                   CHARLIE
                         Sharp as a mashed potato sandwich. 

               Ted fake-guffaws. Charlie is quickly distracted by the relish
               tray.

                                   CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                         Oh wow, look...they've even got
                         baby gherkins!

                                   GINGER
                         I have an idea! I'll be right back!

               And she dashes out the door.  Ted leans towards Julie, who
               quietly observes everything.

                                   TED
                         Well? What do you think of her?

                                   JULIE
                         You're so twitterpated you don't
                         even see the miner's hat and the
                         pickax.

                                   TED
                         You're implying she's, what, a gold
                         digger?

               Julie shrugs. Isn't it obvious?

                                   TED (CONT'D)
                         Charlie's right. Jealousy is so
                         unattractive.

                                   JULIE
                         Second only to unbridled,
                         narcissistic conceit.

                                   TED
                             (whining)
                         Why can't you be nice to me?

                                   JULIE
                         You've got enough people kissing
                         your ass.

               Ginger returns with a rose.

                                   GINGER
                         Here you go, cutie patootie. Rich
                         guys always wear flowers.

               Julie gives Ted a look. See what I mean.

               INT. THE TONIGHT SHOW SET - DAY

               Jay Leno seems charmed.  Ted behaves as if he does this every
               day. The rose from Ginger is pinned to his lapel.

                                   JAY
                         How are the hometown folks treating
                         you, back in Xenia?

                                   TED
                         Well, Jay. They've been
                         exceptionally supportive.

                                   JAY
                         Are they hitting you up for
                         donations? Asking you to sponsor
                         the local quilting bee?

               Audience LAUGHS.

                                   TED
                         I'm no stranger to the notion of
                         philanthropy. Andrew Carnegie has
                         long been one of my idols.

                                   JAY
                         What about the future? You planning
                         to rock the boat at all? Stir
                         things up in "Heaven?"

               Ted's so smooth. We know it's still HIM under all that
               Armani, but it sure does make him LOOK different.

                                   TED
                         Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I
                         are planning to rethink the
                         magazine. To expand the traditional
                         western notions of "beauty."

                                   JAY
                         I see, so you'd be open to little
                         ladies from Pasadena, who want to
                         show you their knickers?

                                   TED
                         Matter of fact, Jay, I'm planning a
                         pictorial focusing on the women of
                         my hometown, "The Girls of Xenia."
                         Just to show my appreciation.

               OFF IN THE WINGS

               Julie looks thoroughly disgusted.

                                   JULIE
                         The Girls of Xenia? Jesus.

               BACK TO STAGE

                                   JAY
                         Now you're talking. What did Andrew
                         Carnegie ever do? Open a couple of
                         libraries? BOR-ING.

               INT. PRINCIPAL MERKIN'S KITCHEN - MORNING

               A Cocker Spaniel, POOCHIE, sits under a breakfast table,
               holding a newspaper in his snout.

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN (O.S.)
                         Poochie?  Where's my poochie? Where
                         is she?

               MRS. MERKIN, dressed in a bathrobe and curlers, prepares
               breakfast.  Their beautiful college-aged daughter, JUDY, eats
               cereal at the table, while flipping through a glamour
               magazine. Principal Merkin enters. Ready for work. Wife and
               daughter don't even look up.

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D)
                         Is my Poochie in here?

               Principal Merkin pretends to look for the dog in the
               cupboard. This is obviously a daily ritual.

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D)
                         Is she in here?  No.  Where on
                         earth could she be?

               He looks under the table.

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D)
                         There's my Poochie!  There's my
                         girl!

               The dog leaps into his arms.  Principal Merkin grabs the
               paper as Poochie starts to lick his face.

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D)
                         Poochie loves Daddy, doesn't she?

                                   MRS. MERKIN
                         Breakfast is getting cold.

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN
                         Thank you, dear.

                                   MRS. MERKIN
                         No dogs at the table.

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN
                         I know, dear.

               Principal Merkin places the dog on the ground, takes a seat,
               and bites into a breakfast sausage.  He opens the paper and
               is confronted by a full page ad.

               CLOSE ON NEWSPAPER AD

               "GIRLS OF XENIA, GO STRAIGHT TO HEAVEN!"  Details follow.
               How, when, where to apply.

               BACK TO PRINCIPAL MERKIN

               Who chokes on his sausage. Clutches his throat. Signaling to
               his wife and daughter. "Help me!" Judy looks up, grossed out.
               Mrs. Merkin attempts the Heimlich Maneuver. Rather ineptly. 
               Principal Merkin turns red, blue, purple. Finally the piece
               of sausage flies out of his mouth, past Judy. Poochie catches
               it in mid-flight.

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN
                             (weakly)
                         Thatta girl.

               INT. PRINCIPAL MERKIN'S HONDA CIVIC - MOVING - DAY

               Principal Merkin drives to work, humming along to Liza
               Minelli's "New York, New York." The song comes to an end and
               a radio spot begins...

                                   RADIO SPOT (V.O.)
                         How many times have people told
                         you, "Jeepers, you look swell
                         naked!" Well now's your chance to
                         go straight to "Heaven!"

               Principal Merkin tries to change the station. But the ad
               seems to be on every station...

                                   RADIO SPOT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                         Come on down for "The Girls of
                         Xenia" pictorial. Let's show the
                         nation our cows aren't the only
                         ones with great udders.

               INT. TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY

               Students hover at the bulletin board, reading a poster
               advertising the "Heaven" auditions.  Principal Merkin pushes
               through the crowd and tears the poster off the board. 
               Completely incensed.

               INT. CITY COUNCIL HALL - EVENING

               Hundreds of Xenia CITIZENS have gathered for this meeting.
               Principal Merkin stands in front of the five members of the
               city council who sit at a U-shaped table.  He holds up
               "Heaven" magazine. Preaching with an evangelical passion...

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN
                         This, my friends, this is not
                         "Heaven." This flesh rag is a one
                         way ticket to hell! We must voice
                         our outrage! To remain passive in
                         the eye of the devil is like
                         inviting him to a pot luck in your
                         own backyard and asking him to
                         bring the three-bean salad!

               His supporters murmur agreement.

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN(CONT'D)
                         For the sake of this community, and
                         its impressionable young minds, I
                         propose this publication be banned
                         from our city!

               His POSSE of supporters APPLAUD. His opponents GROAN. Ted
               slouches nearby.  A lawyer next to him.  The MAYOR bangs the
               gavel and the commotion settles.

                                   MAYOR
                         Thank you for that long-winded but
                         impassioned speech, Mr. Merkin. I
                         hope you can cut to the chase, Ted.

               Principal Merkin takes his seat. Ted rises. Playing the big
               shot lawyer. Julie sits in the crowd, taking notes.

                                   TED
                         With all due respect to Merk, he
                         doesn't have to read my magazine.
                         But he has no right to stop others.
                             (to Principal Merkin)

                         We cannot afford free speech if it
                         excises the moral fiber of this

                         If that were true, this would be
                         one seriously constipated town.
                         Most guys in Xenia have been
                         looking at naked girls in "Heaven"
                         since they were old enough to
                         figure out their dads hide it under
                         the mattress.

               A bit of an UPROAR from the crowd. WOMEN eye their HUSBANDS
               suspiciously. Julie makes a point...

                                   JULIE
                         Isn't it true, Principal Merkin,
                         that you only care now because
                         "Heaven" is suddenly too close to
                         home?

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN
                         Indeed it is, Miss Conroy! I make
                         no bones about it! "Heaven" has
                         gone too far!

               MR. NEEDLEMAN, another angry man from Principal Merkin's
               posse, jumps on the bandwagon.

                                   MR. NEEDLEMAN
                         Principal Merkin is right! We can't
                         let "Heaven" violate our own
                         daughters, wives, sisters, mothers,
                         girlfriends, aunts...

               Helen motions to Ted. He quickly locates a page in the report
               she prepared for him. He handles this like a pro...

                                   TED
                         I wouldn't want to name names, Mr.
                         Needleman, or cause any undue
                         embarrassment. But many members of
                         this community have been loyal
                         "Heaven" readers for the better
                         part of the last two decades. Not
                         to mention certain charter
                         subscribers who have developed a
                         voracious appetite for our video
                         library as well. I don't suppose,
                         "Courtney Leaves The Convent" rings
                         a bell to anyone?

               Mr. Needleman dissolves into his seat. Half the men in the
               audience seem to evaporate.

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN
                         Mr. Nelson, you are Beelzebub's
                         henchman! You are single-handedly
                         destroying the integrity of our
                         community, and I will not have it! 
                         I'll gather signatures. I'll
                         petition the courts.

                                   MAYOR
                             (sheepishly)
                         You do what you have to do, Dick.
                         But if there's a man among us who
                         doesn't like to steal a look at
                         some pretty titty once in a while,
                         let him cast the first stone.

               The room is suddenly SILENT. Principal Merkin gives the Mayor
               a hard look.  Merkin's face contorts in SLOW MO as he
               proclaims...

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN
                         I. AM. THAT. MAN.

               INT. CITY BUILDING CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

               Holding a stack of flyers, Charlie chats with Judy, Merkin's
               college-aged daughter.

                                   CHARLIE
                         You're like a centerfold waiting to
                         happen. And let me assure you, I
                         have some serious pull with the
                         publisher.

               Judy smiles fetchingly. Stashing Charlie's "Heaven" flyer in
               her backpack. Her father suddenly appears.

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN
                         What the hell are you doing?

                                   JUDY
                         I'm an adult. I can do whatever I
                         want.

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN
                         My roof, my rules, young lady.

               He grabs her arm while knocking the stack of flyers out of
               Charlie's hands.  As Principal Merkin drags her away, Judy
               smiles back at Charlie.  He winks.

                                   CHARLIE
                         Send us a picture, sugar.  We'll
                         get back to you.

               The stack of flyers FLOATS over the railing and onto the
               ground floor, just as a group of LOVELY YOUNG WOMEN enters
               the building lobby. They excitedly reach for the flyers.

               EXT. DOWNTOWN BUILDING - XENIA - DAY

               A line of BEAUTIFUL WOMEN - all shapes and sizes - snakes
               around the block and into a doorway.  The women are dressed
               to impress, in very skimpy clothing. Ted pulls up in his
               convertible Ferrari. The women shout greetings as Ted heads
               for the door.

               INT. BUILDING CORRIDOR - DAY

               We follow Ted as he dashes up the stairs, along the line of
               women, towards an office.

                                   TED
                             (greeting the women)
                         Hello there...Looking great...Very
                         nice.

               Charlie looks frazzled.

                                   CHARLIE
                         You're late, bro!

                                   TED
                         Sorry. Ginger got a little, you
                         know, enthusiastic.

                                   CHARLIE
                         You'll never believe who's in
                         there.

                                   TED
                         It better not be my Aunt Trudy.

               They enter...

               INT. TED'S OFFICE - DAY

               A YOUNG WOMAN sits with her back to the door.

                                   TED
                         Sorry to keep you waiting...

               The woman turns towards Ted, revealing herself to be Christy
               Malone.  Ted is momentarily stunned.

                                   CHRISTY
                         Hi, Teddy Bear.

                                   TED
                         Christy?  You want to be in
                         "Heaven?"

                                   CHRISTY
                         I turned eighteen over spring
                         break. I'm eligible.

               Ted doesn't know what to say. Charlie's equally stunned. 
               Hell, it seems, has frozen over.

                                   TED
                         I feel like I've just been hit by a
                         Mack truck.

                                   CHARLIE
                         With a refrigerated cargo bed full
                         of sirloin tip.

               INT. TED'S BEDROOM - DAY

               Highly modified since the last time we saw it. A large flat
               screen hangs on the wall.   A high tech computer system for
               video conferences dominates the room.  Ted speaks with Uncle
               Billy and Helen.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         So far, so good. Some of them have
                         real Angel potential.

                                   TED
                         Really? So I'm doing OK?

                                   HELEN
                         We're impressed but not surprised,
                         Ted. You have your father's
                         impeccable judgment.

               Dad passes the partially open door. Overhearing. He stops.

                                   TED
                         My father must've been amazing.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         He was in a league of his own.

               Suddenly Ted feels his dad's presence, behind him.

                                   DAD
                         Sorry I--

                                   TED
                         It's okay. You need me?

                                   DAD
                             (holding a list)
                         Your mom said you've been ignoring
                         your chores.

               Ted takes the list.  Gives it a cursory glance. Nods to his
               dad, as if dismissing him.

                                   TED
                         No problem, consider it done.
                             (to Uncle Billy)
                         I had this idea of shooting on
                         location. Outdoors, you know? Maybe
                         at some famous Xenia landmarks. 
                         You think that would be a problem?

                                   HELEN
                         We'll send you the release forms,
                         Ted. Our staffers will help in any
                         way they can.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         You're the Titan of Tushies, the
                         General of Jism.  Don't you forget
                         it, Ted-baby.

               Ted laughs. Completely ignoring his dad. Who backs out of the
               room. Unnoticed. Neglected. Hurt.

               EXT. THE NELSON HOUSE - DAY

               Mom drives up to the house.  She stares, aghast.

               There are tall, beautiful, ANGELS everywhere.  One cuts the
               grass.  Another pulls weeds. Two others on the roof, cleaning
               gutters.
               Still others wash the car...with Jimmy handling the water
               hose. Drenching the women, more than the car. Shrieks and
               giggles all around. Neighbors gawk.

               Ted's dad guiltily enjoys the view, but quickly rushes to his
               wife. She gets out of her car and steadies herself on his
               arm. 

               INT. NELSON LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Ted stands on an ottoman as a TAILOR fits him for a prom
               tuxedo. He towers over his parents who try to talk to him. We
               feel for them. They've lost control of their kid.

                                   MOM
                         You have to understand. This was a
                         big shock, for all of us. One
                         minute you're our little boy, of
                         whom we could not be more proud.
                         The next minute you're the owner of
                         this whole pornographic empire.

                                   DAD
                         But that doesn't make you the boss
                         of everything, son.

                                   MOM
                         Don't you see how your self
                         involvement and lack of humility
                         are affecting the whole family?

               Ted looks down at them, literally.

                                   TED
                         I paid off the mortgage! I ordered
                         that Winnebago you always wanted!
                         Now you're ashamed of me?

                                   DAD
                         You ordered a Winnebago?

               Mom gives Dad a look. Stick to the script. Don't be swayed by
               presents.

                                   MOM
                         We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We
                         don't approve of the magazine or
                         the models or the so-called "flesh
                         parties" you attend. But we can get
                         past all that.

                                   DAD
                         We miss you. We miss our son.

                                   MOM
                         We miss our family.

                                   TED
                         I promised I'd finish high school
                         and that's what I'm doing. What
                         more do you want from me?

               Dad glances at Mom, hesitant.  She nods, giving him the
               courage to continue.

                                   DAD
                         We think you should give up the
                         magazine. Sell it. Let someone else
                         run it. Whatever it takes.

                                   MOM
                         We want you to go to college, find
                         a career you love, marry a nice
                         girl from a nice family, and live
                         happily ever after.

               Ted laughs.

                                   TED
                         THAT is your dream, not mine. My
                         dream is so far beyond anything YOU
                         PEOPLE could even imagine.

                                   DAD
                         Watch your tone, mister.

                                   TED
                         Why don't you just admit what this
                         is really all about? I'm not your
                         real kid and you can't control me
                         anymore.

               Mom and Dad look stricken. Ted doesn't know when to stop...

                                   TED (CONT'D)
                         No wonder I was so bored. No wonder
                         I hated this one-horse cow town. I
                         come from talented people who took
                         chances and dared to imagine a life
                         without limits! I was never meant
                         to be raised by...GROCERS.

               Ted storms away, unintentionally CRASHING into a TREASURED
               FAMILY PHOTO on the end table. The frame shatters into
               smithereens. Breaking Mom and Dad's hearts. STUNNED SILENCE
               hangs heavy in the room. 

               INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

               Prom night.  Couples slow dance to a Marilyn Manson clone,
               singing a rock version of "Precious and Few."

               Principal Merkin watches on the sidelines.  Surprisingly
               calm. Suspiciously happy.

               Ted caresses Ginger's bare back as they dance together. His
               head nestled against her breasts. Not a care in the world. 
               He spots Charlie on the dance floor. Making out with one of
               his dates, the IDENTICAL TAYLOR TRIPLETS, while the other two
               patiently wait their turn.

                                   GINGER
                         Teddy? I was thinking.

                                   TED
                         Hmmm?

                                   GINGER
                         After graduation...maybe we could
                         go away together?

                                   TED
                         Whatever you want.

               WE notice Christy Malone dancing with her FOOTBALL CAPTAIN
               DATE. The perfect male specimen. Christy gives Ted a
               disappointed, longing gaze. But he's oblivious.

                                   GINGER
                         I bet St. Tropez in July would be
                         paradise. For a honeymoon. 

               Suddenly a FLASH blinds them. It's Julie Conroy, doing her
               job.  Following her subject.

                                   GINGER (CONT'D)
                             (snapping)
                         You could have warned us.

                                   JULIE
                         Oops, sorry. Warning: You've got
                         lipstick on your teeth.

               Julie flashes the camera again. Capturing Ginger's panicked
               expression. We notice that Julie looks alluring in a deep
               purple strapless gown. Not so glamorous as Ginger, but far
               more appealing and natural.

                                   TED
                         Wow...you clean up nice. 

                                   JULIE
                         Put your eyeballs back in your
                         head, William Randolph. I'm on
                         assignment. A girl has to fit in.

               Ginger seems testy and jealous. Her true colors emerging.

                                   GINGER
                         Teddy, I thought we were having a
                         moment here. 

                                   TED
                         Of course we were.

               Suddenly the music dies.  Everyone turns to the stage where
               Principal Merkin stands proudly. Holding a power cord.

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN
                         I apologize for interrupting the
                         festivities, but I have some good
                         news. I've been reviewing the rules
                         and regulations set forth by the
                         superintendent of schools. And it
                         seems quite clear...
                             (reading from manual)
                         "Minors may not be accompanied to
                         school functions by adults unless
                         they are their parents or legal
                         guardians."

               A spotlight suddenly finds Ted and Charlie's beautiful dates.

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D)
                         So long, ladies. Prom's over.

               The crowd boos, hisses.

                                   TED
                         Honestly, Merk. It's like you were
                         never seventeen and the head of a
                         media empire.

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN
                         Rules are rules.

                                   TED
                         Come on, it's our only senior prom.

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN
                         Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to
                         a higher power.

               Charlie steps in like a hostage negotiator.

                                   CHARLIE
                         Here's the deal, Merk.  Forget the
                         "rules and regulations" malarkey
                         and we'll give you seven minutes in
                         heaven with the Taylor Triplets.

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN
                         Out! Now!

               Ted realizes his high school reputation is at stake. He steps
               up on stage. Approaches Principal Merkin. Takes out his
               wallet.

                                   TED
                         What's your price, Merk? How much
                         will it cost to make you go bye
                         bye?

               The crowd CHEERS.

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN
                         You're crossing the line, Mr.
                         Nelson.

                                   TED
                         A statue in front of city hall,
                         dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN
                         I'm warning you.

                                   TED
                         A new pediatric wing at the
                         hospital? A presidential campaign?
                         Name it. Anything.

               Principal Merkin trembles from the sheer temptation of it.
               Yet he could never succumb in front of so many witnesses. He
               has to maintain his dignity...

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN
                         That's it! You're out of here!

               From nowhere, a flock of beefy SECURITY GUARDS emerge to
               remove Ted & Co.

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D)
                         Good-bye, Mr. Nelson.  Have a
                         pleasant evening.

               The Marilyn Manson clone is rapidly whisked away, and
               replaced by six GEEZERS in powder blue tuxedoes.

               As Security Guards carry them away...

                         This is humiliating. We're being
                         ejected from a prom!

                         Hang in there, I'll think of
                         something.

               As they reach the doors...

                                   GINGER
                         Well?

                                   TED
                         I guess...I don't know...I guess we
                         should leave if we're not wanted.

                                   CHARLIE
                         I hear you, bro. We're Angus men in
                         a ground round town.

                                   GINGER
                         This is what I get for playing den
                         mother in "Romper Room." Take me to
                         the airport, Charlie!

                                   CHARLIE
                         Why don't you just hitch a ride on
                         the horse you rode in on?

               Ginger storms away in an angry huff.

                                   CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                             (calling after her)
                         Don't forget your broom!

               Ted experiences a moment of loss.

                                   TED
                         I thought I loved her.

                         Chicks are like buses. If you miss
                         one, don't sweat it. There's
                         another coming 'round the corner.

                One of the Taylor Triplets bats her lashes at Ted.

                                   CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                             (whispering to Ted)
                         Take your pick. They're IDENTICAL. 

               Ted grins broadly. He turns and SHOUTS to his classmates...

                                   TED
                         Everybody, listen up! This prom
                         sucks!  Let's party at my place!

               Responses are mixed. Some cheer, some are undecided. Until
               the new band starts playing, "Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the
               Old Oak Tree." And EVERYONE RUSHES for the exit, following
               Ted.

               INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

               A muzak version of "Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak
               Tree," continues.  A PIZZA DELIVERY GUY watches the numbers
               rise to the penthouse.  Suddenly the doors open to reveal...

               INT. HOTEL PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

               All four penthouse suites have been rented by Ted.  It's
               party central. Very wild.  Quickly growing out of control.
               Kids dance, play drinking games, Spin the Bottle, and
               generally trash the place.

               The pizza delivery guy wheels a dolly with a huge stack of
               pizzas into the party, only to be attacked by the prom-goers
               like starving beasts. Grabbing the pizzas.  Devouring them
               hungrily.

               TED'S LUXURIOUS HOTEL SUITE

               Ted, Charlie, the Taylor Triplets and several buddies lounge
               around, drunkenly watching THE HOME SHOPPING CHANNEL on Ted's
               big screen TV.  A tacky CERAMIC GNOME rotates on the screen.
               Ted swigs Dom Perignon straight from the bottle. He shouts
               orders into his cell phone...

                                   TED
                         Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen
                         of 'em!

                                   CHARLIE
                         No, leave one. Somebody's
                         grandmother might want one.

                                   TED
                         And while you're at it, I'll take
                         ten dozen of those puppies with the
                         springy heads.

                                   CHARLIE
                         I love those springy head puppies!  

               CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

               Ted looks up as the elevator doors open.  Principal Merkin
               has arrived. Ted confronts him...

                                   TED
                         You kicked us off your turf, Merk. 
                         Don't rain on our parade.

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN
                         Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me.
                         First you break our school board
                         rules. Then you break the law.

                                   TED
                         What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting
                         down our hair on prom night?

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN
                         Our state has a zero tolerance
                         policy for underage drinking. 

                                   TED
                         You called the cops on us?

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN
                         Alcohol does horrible things to a
                         developing young mind.

               Suddenly the whole XENIA POLICE FORCE appears, in full riot
               gear.  The party's over.  Everyone runs for the stairs.  Ted
               gives Principal Merkin a spiteful look and joins the mass
               exodus.

               EXT. HOLIDAY INN - NIGHT

               Drunken teenagers pour out of the building.  Dashing for
               their cars and limos.  Ted's among them.  Suddenly he's cut
               off by a Harley that stops right in front of him.  It's
               Julie.  Still in her purple strapless prom dress. With a
               black motorcycle jacket over it.

                                   JULIE
                         Need a lift?

               Ted jumps on, wrapping his arms around her waist. Julie takes
               off.

               EXT. STREETS OF XENIA - CONTINUOUS

               Julie maneuvers the nighttime streets of Xenia, taking off

               down a country road.

                                   TED (V.O.)
                         Where are we going?

                                   JULIE (V.O.)
                         To the best hiding place in the
                         world.

               EXT. JULIE'S BACKYARD - NIGHT

               Now we understand. Julie's family comes from major bucks. The
               yard is massive. And resting in a sprawling oak tree is the
               best hiding place in the world.

               INT. JULIE'S TREE HOUSE - NIGHT

               A cozy oasis. Books everywhere.  A whole series of
               flashlights hang upside down like lanterns. Giving the tree
               house a warm glow.

                                   TED
                         I can't believe your dad built this
                         for you.

                                   JULIE
                         He didn't. He had it built.

                                   TED
                         Whatever.

                                   JULIE
                         Not "whatever."  It's two different
                         things.

                                   TED
                         He cared enough to want you to have
                         it.

                                   JULIE
                         He phoned it in.

                                   TED
                         I see.

                                   JULIE
                         I doubt it.

                                   TED
                         Now it makes sense, the whole neo
                         Bohemian, down with hypocrisy,
                         fight the power crap. You're a poor
                         little rich girl.

                                   JULIE
                         The ozone must be fully depleted on
                         Planet Ted.

                                   TED
                         You think my dad would have been
                         like that if I knew him? You think
                         he would have bought me a stadium,
                         instead of teaching me how to play
                         ball? 

                                   JULIE
                         Your dad taught you everything.

                                   TED
                         I mean my father.

                                   JULIE
                         A father is nothing but sperm, Ted.
                         It takes a real man to be a dad.

                                   TED
                         It's all so complicated.

                                   JULIE
                         It's incredibly simple.

                                   TED
                         I feel like I'm being drawn and
                         quartered. Like every part of me is
                         being pushed and pulled and tugged
                         in a different direction.

                                   JULIE
                         Eventually you'll let go.

                                   TED
                         And then what?

                                   JULIE
                         Then you'll see who's really
                         holding on to you.

                                   TED
                         You're amazing.

                                   JULIE
                         I know.

                                   TED
                         Even when you infuriate me, I still
                         want to kiss you. 

                                   JULIE
                         But you never do.

                                   TED
                         If we were a team, we could do
                         anything. I mean, anything.

               Julie's eyes narrow. She should have known.

                                   JULIE
                         Cut to the chase, William Randolph. 
                         Your audience is way ahead of you.

                                   TED
                         In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.

                                   JULIE
                         That's two words. And I'm out of
                         the "exposed" business, remember? I
                         need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a
                         boy scout.

                                   TED
                         There's gotta be something. We have
                         to dig deeper. 

                                   JULIE
                         You forget, I dislike YOU at least
                         as much as him.

                                   TED
                         He shut down your paper!  You're
                         stuck writing articles about swap
                         meets and raffles and PTA brunches!

               He's right, but...

                                   JULIE
                         A good journalist can take lemons
                         and make lemonade. I'm honing my
                         craft.

                                   TED
                         Then you won't mind covering that
                         watermelon seed spitting contest
                         next week...

               Julie groans.

               INT. OLD FOLK'S HOME - NIGHT

               Dressed in a old fashioned barber costume, complete with a
               handle bar mustache, Principal Merkin sings as part of a
               BARBER SHOP QUARTET. The senior citizens clap
               enthusiastically.

               Ted and Julie peek through a crack in the doorway.
               Disappointment on their faces.

               INT. SOUP KITCHEN - ANOTHER NIGHT

               Principal Merkin pours soup into the bowl of a shabbily
               dressed HOMELESS MAN. Julie shoots Ted an "I told you so"
               look.

               EXT. HIGHWAY - SATURDAY AFTERNOON

               Principal Merkin supervises a crew of kindergarten CHILDREN,
               cleaning up the roadside litter. Julie and Ted watch from...

               A BRIDGE ABOVE THE HIGHWAY

                                   JULIE
                         See what I mean. He's squeaky
                         clean. He makes Gandhi look like a
                         war monger.

               Ted steels himself. Somehow, they'll get him.

               EXT. XENIA - WATER TOWER - DAY

               In the golden light of sunset, MOLLY, a stunning "Xenia
               Girl," stands on the stairs that curve up around a huge water
               tower that overlooks the city.  Her loose spring dress
               billows in the wind. Held on by only one button. Exposing in
               quick glimpses that she isn't wearing a bra. 

               An ASSISTANT holds a portable strobe, attached to a
               reflector.  Charlie shoots with his Nikon.  Motor drive
               whirling.  

                                   TED
                         I have a great idea.  Let's lose
                         the last button.

               Molly grins. Then unbuttons. We hear a round of "oohs" from
               below.  Ted glances down, where...

               Hundreds of binoculars, cameras, and camcorders are poised on
               the scene.  Men of all ages are milling around, gawking,
               focusing their long lenses.  Women are conspicuously absent. 
               Except for the gaggle of hardcore FEMINISTS with their
               placards, denouncing "Heaven."

               One Feminist approaches the Mayor.

                                   FEMINIST
                         The city tower belongs to the city,
                         not to some pornographer.

                                   MAYOR
                         The library also belongs to the
                         city.  And guess what?  It's going
                         to have a new Ted Nelson wing with 
                         three thousand children's books.

               The Feminist tries to respond, but a helicopter swoops
               overhead, drowning out her words. The helicopter rises to the
               level of the photo shoot where the door slides open.  And
               just when we think it must have been hired by some hard core
               fans who wanted a closer look, we find Principal Merkin
               frowning as he barks through a bullhorn.

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN
                         You should be ashamed, young lady! 
                         Your body is a sacred temple!

               Molly flashes him. Principal Merkin averts his eyes.  Missing
               the sight of Molly's dress being blown off her body by the
               chopper's prop wash.  The spectators below APPLAUD.  They
               watch in amazement as her dress floats down to them.

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D)
                         Young lady, I will pray for god's
                         mercy upon your soul.

                                   MOLLY
                         Don't bother, Merk! I'm already
                         going to "Heaven!"

                                   TED
                             (to Charlie)
                         Get them together.

                                   CHARLIE
                             (eyes lighting up)
                         Brilliant!  Molly, give me all
                         you've got.  For Merk.

               Molly gets the idea.  She poses provocatively towards
               Principal Merkin, who suddenly realizes he's in a
               compromising position.

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN
                         Stop that, stop that this instant!

               But Molly pulls off her panties and flings them at him.

               INT. TED'S LUXURIOUS HOTEL SUITE - DESK AREA - THAT NIGHT

               Uncle Billy chortles, his image glowing on a large flat
               screen monitor that hangs on the wall.  Ted leans back in his
               chair.

                                   TED
                         I never saw anybody turn so many
                         shades of red.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         I can't wait to see the pictures.

                                   TED
                         It was incredible. The light, the
                         crowd, everything.

               Uncle Billy grins proudly at Ted.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         Such enthusiasm. Have I told you
                         lately how proud I am of you?

                                   TED
                         Seriously? I'm doing all right?

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         You're taking this bull of an
                         empire by the horns, but you're
                         still keeping your small town
                         values. You're not letting all this
                         "stuff" spoil you.

               Ted knows it's not true. He looks guilty.

                                   TED
                         I owe it all to you. Without your
                         help I'd be lost.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         I wish I knew you years ago, when
                         my brother was alive. I wish he
                         never gave you up.

                                   TED
                         Yeah, well, like my Grandpa used to
                         say...you can't change your
                         Christmas past, but you sure can
                         exchange your Christmas presents.

               Uncle Billy forces a laugh.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         Why don't you come to town this
                         weekend? We could play some golf,
                         chase some skirts.

               Ted smiles at the appealing offer.

                                   TED
                         I'd love to, but I really need to
                         crack the books.  Final exams are
                         coming up and I've been slacking.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         You're right. I should work, too.
                         Our first issue together is almost
                         ready to print.

                                   TED
                         Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for
                         everything.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         You're a great kid. Don't you
                         forget it.

               With that, he's gone. The room is completely silent. And Ted
               is completely alone.

               UNTIL the doorbell CHIMES.

               TED'S LUXURIOUS HOTEL SUITE - ENTRY WAY - NIGHT

               Ted opens the door. It's Jimmy, with his shiny new bike.

                                   TED
                         James, what are you doing here?

                                   JIMMY
                         You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl
                         Petersen said James sounds too
                         pretentious.

                                   TED
                         Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine
                         years old, what does she know?

                                   JIMMY
                         She knew exactly where you were
                         staying, which you neglected to
                         tell me, your own brother.

                                   TED
                         It's really late...do your parents
                         know where you are?

                                   JAMES
                         Mom and Dad think I'm tucked safely
                         in bed and that's all they need to
                         know. Will this discussion be
                         continuing in the hallway, or
                         somewhere slightly more inviting?

               TED'S LUXURIOUS HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM 

               Jimmy seems impressed by the opulence. He takes off his bike
               helmet, looks around.

                                   JIMMY
                         Impressive. This is bigger than our
                         whole house.

                                   TED
                         Most places are, Jimmy.

                                   JIMMY
                         They say money can't buy happiness
                         but this is a reasonably good
                         facsimile.

                         So, what brings you here at his
                         hour?

                                   JIMMY
                         My new bike.

                                   TED
                         Very funny.

                                   JIMMY
                         I came to ask permission to take
                         custody of your room.

                                   TED
                         My room?

                                   JIMMY
                         Better view, more spacious, new
                         carpet. It's a no-brainer.

                                   TED
                         It's not up to me.

                                   JIMMY
                         Mom and Dad said it's yours. They
                         seem to think you're coming home.

                                   TED
                         You can have it, then. I'm not
                         going back there.

               Jimmy whips out a piece of paper from his pocket.

                                   JIMMY
                         If you could just sign right there.

                                   TED
                         You want it in writing?

                                   JIMMY
                         Just a formality.

               Ted signs. Jimmy squirrels away the paper, excitedly. Starts
               to zip up his wind breaker.

                                   TED
                         That's it? I mean, you don't want
                         to order room service or anything?
                         We could play games and watch
                         movies and stuff.

                                   JIMMY
                         Are you kidding? Mom and Dad
                         discover I'm gone and I'll be doing
                         hard time.

                                   TED
                         Are they okay?

                                   JIMMY
                         Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes
                         are nearly swollen shut from crying
                         and Dad spends all his time under
                         the car trying to fix stuff that
                         isn't broken, things couldn't be
                         better.

                                   TED
                         I miss them, too.

                                   JIMMY
                         You can't come back. That is, you
                         can, but your things will be in the
                         room you currently think of as
                         mine.

                                   TED
                         You're a peach.

                                   JIMMY
                         Funny you should say that. My
                         Grandfather was a peach farmer.

               Ouch. For the first time, that really smarts. 

                                   TED
                         He was my Grandfather, too.

                                   JIMMY
                         I meant biologically.

                                   TED
                         That's a crappy thing to say.

                                   JIMMY
                         Look Ted. I'm cool with everything.
                         You've long been dissatisfied with
                         our mediocre little town. You've
                         always had an itch for the good
                         life. I'm happy for you. This
                         couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

               Ted listens.

                                   JIMMY (CONT'D)
                         But just for the record, my Mom is
                         a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad
                         is the best damn auto mechanic this
                         side of the Himalayas. You seem to
                         have forgotten they opened Nelson's
                         FAMILY Market so they could build
                         something permanent, a legacy, for
                         us. Their kids.

                                   TED
                         I didn't forget.

                                   JIMMY
                         You ever look down on them again
                         and call them "grocers" like it's a
                         dirty word, and you'll be sucking
                         your filet mignon through a straw
                         for six to eight weeks. Got it?

               Ted's stunned. Talk about tough love.

                                   TED
                         Loud and clear.

               Suddenly the phone rings. Ted sheepishly explains...

                         That's probably my office.

                         I got an anonymous tip and an
                         address in Cincinnati.

                         Let's do it.

               TED'S LUXURIOUS HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - THAT MOMENT

               Ted hangs up the phone.  Looks around.  Jimmy's gone. But his
               SHINY NEW BIKE is left behind.

               INT. CINCINNATI NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

               Not much of a place. A middle-aged TORCH SINGER croons "MY
               ROMANCE."  Ted and Julie find their way to corner table.
               Keeping an eye out for Principal Merkin.

                                   TED
                         I don't know. This place seems
                         pretty tame.

                                   JULIE
                         You expected whips, chains, Merk
                         being cattle-prodded by some
                         dominatrix in a leather hood?

                                   TED
                         At least it's not another 4-H
                         meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.

                                   JULIE
                         Amen to that.

               Their heads are very close together. A conspiratorial tête-à
               tête.

                                   TED
                         Look at us. It's one o'clock in the
                         morning, on a school night. We're
                         in a smoky nightclub, hoping to
                         catch our principal with some big
                         city tart.

                                   JULIE
                         I'm trembling with excitement. 

                                   TED
                         That has more to do with your
                         proximity to me.

                                   JULIE
                             (playing along)
                         My desire betrays me, like
                         goosebumps on my flesh. 

                                   TED
                         I have a bit of a goosebump fetish.
                         Not many people know that.

                                   JULIE
                         I figured you for more of a hairy
                         armpit guy.

                                   TED
                         Shoes, if you want to know the
                         truth. Shoes are my thing.

                                   JULIE
                         Wearing them?  Or humping them?

                                   TED
                         My fantasy is a totally naked
                         woman, wearing nothing but a Timex
                         and suede clogs.

                                   JULIE
                         That's refreshingly deviant.

                                   TED
                         What about you?

                         I'm very aural.

                                   JULIE
                         Sounds, voices, music, humming. All
                         of it can turn me on, or off, like
                         a switch.

                         I see.

                                   JULIE
                         I had a Portuguese boyfriend who
                         could read the phone book and melt
                         me.

                                   TED
                             (jealous)
                         A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very
                         "Cosmo."  

                                   JULIE
                         You live and learn. I realized the
                         most important thing to me, above
                         all, is trust.

                                   TED
                         Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? 
                         I saw that one coming.

                                   JULIE
                         You lose trust in someone and it's
                         over, done, gone, forever.

               At that moment, the TORCH SINGER begins crooning "PEOPLE."

                                   TED
                         Do you trust me, Julie?

                                   JULIE
                         Not a chance.

                                   TED
                         Come on.

                                   JULIE
                         Trust is something you earn, over
                         time. You don't just inherit it
                         overnight like a gazillion dollar
                         empire.

               Ted leans even closer. Looking into her eyes. Using his
               voice. Being as aurally seductive as he can.

                                   TED
                         I want you to trust me.

                                   JULIE
                         Maybe someday.

                                   TED
                         Julie, I'll tell you something that
                         is the god's honest truth. I've
                         seen a lot of really beautiful
                         girls. I mean a lot. But none of
                         them make me feel like you do.

                                   JULIE
                         That's hard to believe.

                                   TED
                         But absolutely true.

               Ted moves closer.  Julie doesn't move away.  The SINGER seems
               to be performing just for them.

                                   SINGER (O.S.)
                         ..."A feeling deep in your
                         soul/Says you were half, now you're
                         whole..."

               Just as Ted and Julie are about to kiss, Julie's eyes widen.
               She grabs Ted's hand. Simultaneously, they turn towards THE
               SINGER...

                                   JULIE & TED
                         OH. MY. GOD.

               It's the Mother Lode!  That's not just any middle-aged torch
               singer. That's Principal Merkin.  Dressed in drag as Barbra
               Streisand. And doing a mighty fine job of it.

               Ted pulls out his camera and fires away. Blinded by the stage
               lights, Principal Merkin sings and vogues glamorously. He has
               no idea his secret is out.

               EXT. NIGHTCLUB/CINCINNATI STREET - NIGHT

               Ted and Julie rush down the street in the rain, giggling,
               totally euphoric. They stop to catch their breath. Their
               clothes are drenched, but they couldn't care less. In no time
               they've got their arms wrapped around one another, kissing
               and laughing.

                                   TED
                         We just found the ULTIMATE
                         centerfold for "The Girls of
                         Xenia!"

               Suddenly Julie sobers, pulls away.

                                   JULIE
                         I have to be honest with you, Ted.
                         I really despise "The Girls of
                         Xenia."

                                   TED
                         I know, their small town mentality
                         can be maddening.

                                   JULIE
                         I mean your pictorial. It bothers
                         me, profoundly.

                                   TED
                         Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like
                         being a doctor.

               Julie eyes him skeptically.

                                   JULIE
                         You're telling me you don't get
                         aroused by a roomful of naked
                         breasts.

                                   TED
                         You've seen one naked breast,
                         you've seem them all.

                                   JULIE
                         Which explains the continued
                         success of "Heaven" for how many
                         decades? 

                                   TED
                         You're quick. I like that.

                                   JULIE
                         You think you're working with
                         chimps here?

                                   TED
                         The thing is, I made a commitment.
                         I said I'd do it and I have to keep
                         my word.

                                   JULIE
                         Keeping your word is something I
                         can actually respect, Ted.

                                                       CUT TO:

               TREMBLING HANDS, STRUGGLING TO LOAD A ROLL OF FILM INTO A
               NIKON.

               INT. TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - GIRL'S LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

               Ted closes the back of his camera. Takes a deep breath. And
               forces a confident smile. He then peers into the...

               SHOWER

               Where Christy Malone limbers up.  Stretching her leg against
               the wall. Wearing her sexy cheerleader uniform.

                                   CHRISTY
                         I thought I'd be nervous, but you
                         sure know how to make a girl feel
                         relaxed, Teddy Bear.

                                   TED
                         I do? I mean, yeah, I do.

                                   CHRISTY
                         I have to admit, I am so totally
                         turned on. We should do it. Now. 

                                   TED
                         Do it?

                                   CHRISTY
                         You know...take the pictures?

               Christy does her warm-up contortionist poses for Ted. 
               Clothes still on.  As reflectors bounce strobes into the
               shower area.

               Years of being a merciless tease, paying off right here and
               now. Christy knows how to make love to the camera.

                                   TED
                         I remember the first time you
                         walked into Mrs. Temple's class in
                         2nd grade. Blue gingham dress.
                         Blond ponytail.

                                   CHRISTY
                         Which you pulled, hard!

                                   TED
                         That was code for "I like you." 

               Christy giggles.

                                   CHRISTY
                         Wanna unzip me?

               Ted slowly unzips Christy's top, catching a glimpse of her
               long, sensuous back. She resumes posing. Flashing a bare
               shoulder.  A coy look. She doesn't need direction. She's a
               natural.

                                   CHRISTY (CONT'D)
                         Remember dress up day?  You and
                         Charlie lifting skirts during
                         recess.

                                   TED
                         I miss those days, when schoolyard
                         sexual harassment was without
                         consequence.

                                   CHRISTY
                         Things change. Now I'm taking off
                         my clothes...all by myself.

               Christy slips off her cheerleader top. Lowers her skirt.
               Flings it aside. She's wearing only panties the size of a
               Band-aid. Ted is mute. Staring at her perfect body.

                                   CHRISTY (CONT'D)
                         Well? 

                                   TED
                         You have changed since second
                         grade.

                                   CHRISTY
                         I mean, what do you think?

                                   TED
                         You expect me to think at a time
                         like this? There isn't a drop of
                         blood in my brain.

                                   CHRISTY
                         Oh, Teddy Bear, you're funny.

               Ted steps out of the shower.  Out of Christy's sight, he
               squirms in his jeans. Trying to hide his enthusiasm.

               MUSIC suddenly seems to come from nowhere. Nine Inch Nails.
               "I Want to Fuck You Like An Animal."

                                   TED
                             (sotto)
                         God help me.

               Ted steps back into the shower.  Christy rubs an ice cube on
               her left nipple.  

                                   CHRISTY
                         I heard they do this on photo
                         shoots.  Wanna to do the other one?

               She tosses him the ice cube. He fumbles. It lands on the
               floor.

                                   TED
                         You're doing just fine, Christy.
                         Believe me.

                                   CHRITY
                         Then I'm ready when you are.

               Ted looks through the lens. We can see him trembling.  Music
               blasts as Ted's camera burns through film.  They're both
               getting into it.  Water pulsating over her body. Steam
               rising.  Christy begins lathering her breasts.

                                   CHRISTY
                         I was always too shy to admit how
                         much I liked you.

                                   TED
                         Come on, I was hamburger. You were
                         porterhouse.

                                   CHRISTY
                         Maybe on the outside. But inside,
                         deep down, I've always been
                         dripping with special sauces. 
                             (she smiles, sexily)
                         Are you hungry?

               Is he hungry. He's been working up this appetite for ten
               years. He can barely contain himself.

                                   TED
                         God, you are so hot. 

                                   CHRISTY
                         Then you better get in the water,
                         before you get burned. 

               Ted calls her bluff. He sets aside his camera. Walks right
               into the water. Through the steam.  Toward Christy. She wraps
               a leg around him, sucking face, wanting more.

                                   CHRISTY (CONT'D)
                         You and me, finally. This will be
                         so fantastic, Teddy Bear. Trust me.

               Suddenly Ted stops. Remembering what Julie said about trust. 

                                   TED
                         I'm sorry, Christy. I've been crazy
                         about you forever, and this is
                         definitely a page right out of my
                         palm pilot, but I just can't go
                         through with it.

               He turns away, but Christy presses her bare body against his
               back.  Wrapping her hands around his waist. Caressing his
               chest, his stomach...

                                   CHRISTY
                         Sure you can. You're only human.
                         It's not like you're made of steel.
                             (she lowers her hand)
                         Or ARE you? 

                                                       SMASH CUT TO:

               Ted and Christy locked in a steamy embrace. Rolling on the
               floor. Hands, arms, lips, tongues, all in motion. As the
               shower drenches them.

               Suddenly, they roll into a pair of legs.  Both look up.  The
               steam clears to reveal Julie. Arms crossed. Hurt, but not
               surprised. 

                                   JULIE
                         What's up, doc?

               She doesn't wait for an explanation. Christy covers herself.
               Ted chases after Julie.

                                   TED
                         Wait, Julie, wait!

               INT. TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Julie dashes out of the girls' locker room, passing a
               JANITOR.  Ted follows, dripping water.

                                   JANITOR
                         I'm sorry, Mr. Ted. She pushed
                         right past me.

                                   TED
                             (calling after Julie)
                         At least let me explain!

               Julie darts into the girls' restroom.  Ted stops at the door. 
               Then realizes there is no one else around.  He heads inside.

               INT. GIRLS' RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Julie's too proud to let him see her cry. But we can tell
               she's upset.

                                   JULIE
                         Go away, Ted. Just go.

               Ted corners her near a row of sinks.

                                   TED
                         Please believe me. It was just a
                         kiss for old time's sake. I've had
                         a stupid crush on her since I was
                         seven, but I never got closer to
                         her than four feet and then there
                         she was right in front of me,
                         completely naked.

               Julie looks at him, pensively. She unzips the back of her
               summery dress. And lets it fall to the floor. She's
               completely naked and absolutely gorgeous.

               Ted gasps. He's been around dozens of naked women by now, but
               this one he can't just gawk at. This one he really cares
               about. 

                                   JULIE
                         Being naked is no big deal. It has
                         nothing to do with emotion, nothing
                         to do with love. You can be around
                         all the naked girls you want and
                         you won't be even one step closer
                         to anything meaningful in your
                         life.

               She puts on her dress, gracefully. As if nothing happened.

                                   JULIE (CONT'D)
                         See that? You don't know me even
                         one ounce better than you did
                         before. You and your stupid 
                         magazine. I liked you better when
                         you were sweet and kind and human,
                         like the rest of us.

               At that moment, Ted's cell phone rings. Julie walks away,
               leaving Ted completely alone. He answers, lifelessly...

                                   TED
                         Yes?

                                   UNCLE BILLY (O.S.)
                         We've got a huge problem with the
                         magazine, Ted-baby. Our readers
                         hate it. HATE IT. We need to talk. 

               INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY

               Ted walks down the hallway.  Three JOCKS look through the new
               issue of "Heaven." Laughing.  They taunt Ted. 

                                   JOCK #1
                         You got a great sense of humor. I
                         love the three hundred pound Eskimo
                         chick.

                                   JOCK #2
                         You like Eskimo pie, Teddy?

                                   JOCK #3
                         I like the African chick with the
                         big lip. You could stash a lot of
                         weed in there. Maybe even a six
                         pack.

               Ted's mortified, depressed. Charlie appears next to him with
               "Heaven" in hand.

                                   CHARLIE
                         Holy stinkers, what were you
                         thinking?

                                   TED
                         We wanted to challenge the notions
                         of classic beauty. We wanted to
                         showcase women throughout the
                         world.

                                   CHARLIE
                         Next time, make sure you put a barf
                         bag in the centerfold. 

               Principal Merkin approaches. Also holding "Heaven" in his
               hand. 

                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN
                         Ted, I realize I owe you an
                         apology. You're destroying "Heaven"
                         much faster from the inside than I
                         ever could from the outside. Good
                         job, son.

               Ted could not feel worse.

               INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

               Ted, Uncle Billy, and Helen. Meeting with the HEADS OF
               VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS.

                                   HEAD OF MARKETING
                         Our advertisers are wigging out.
                         Half of them are threatening to
                         pull their ads for next month. The
                         other half already did.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         It was nothing more than beginner's
                         folly. Tell everyone to lighten up. 

                                   HELEN
                         It's a little more serious than
                         that, Bill. The stockholders have
                         requested a meeting. They want our
                         guarantee that this will never
                         happen again.
                             (the words pain her)
                         Some of them are even calling for
                         Ted's resignation.

                                   TED
                         Look, the girls of Xenia are
                         gorgeous, you'll see. Next month
                         we'll be back to normal.

                                   HEAD OF FINANCE
                         Another disaster like this could
                         sink us. We've got thousands of
                         subscribers requesting refunds.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         The kid came up with something that
                         sounded good on paper. Who knew our
                         readers wouldn't dig it?

               Ted bristles. THE KID?  The kid came up with something?

                                   HEAD OF MARKETING
                         We tried to warn you.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         Sometimes young people need to make
                         their own mistakes. That's how they
                         learn.

               Ted can see that Uncle Billy's playing this out differently
               than he imagined. Giving Ted all the "credit."

                                   TED
                             (firmly; to Uncle Billy)
                         It won't happen again. It will
                         never happen again.

               INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - TED'S OFFICE - DAY

               Ted sits at his father's desk.  Going through paperwork. 
               Figures.  Charts. Reports. CEO work.  In the b.g., he hears
               the PLAYFUL SOUNDS of women.  Which distract him.

               Ted approaches the window and watches a group of girls
               splashing and playing in the pool. He looks sad. Helen enters
               behind him.  He turns to her.

                                   TED
                         I always thought I wanted fame and
                         fortune and beautiful women. But
                         sometimes your dreams come true,
                         and they cause you nothing but
                         grief. I just want to chuck
                         everything and sell the stupid
                         magazine. It's not worth the pain.

               Helen takes Ted's hand, comfortingly.

                                   HELEN
                         Come, let me show you something.

               INT. MANSION ATTIC - DAY

               Helen and Ted sit on old trunk. Helen holds a scrapbook in
               her arms. Explaining to Ted...

                                   HELEN
                         Your parents never wanted to
                         interfere with your life, Ted. They
                         knew your Mom and Dad loved you
                         very much. They knew they did the
                         right thing. But that doesn't mean
                         they didn't watch you and miss you,
                         from afar.

                                   TED
                         You mean they knew who I was?

                                   HELEN
                         They kept this scrapbook of your
                         life. It meant the world to them.

               CLOSE ON SCRAPBOOK

               We see baby pictures of Ted, taken through the glass of a
               nursery. A newspaper photo of Ted playing a donkey in a
               nativity play. And clippings from Ted's high school
               newspaper.

                                   TED
                         I wondered about them, for so many
                         years. I wondered if I looked like
                         them, acted like them. I wondered
                         why they gave me up.

                                   HELEN
                         Giving you up was the most
                         unselfish thing they ever did. When
                         they founded "Heaven," they wished
                         they could take you back but it was
                         too late.
                         All they could do was build the
                         empire, knowing that someday it
                         would all be yours.

                                   TED
                         My legacy.

                                   HELEN
                         Your parents would be crushed to
                         think you weren't happy with it.

                                   TED
                         They're not my parents, Helen. My
                         parents are back in Xenia and I
                         hurt them very much.

                                   HELEN
                         I understand.

                                   TED
                         And the girl I love, she hates
                         "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll
                         never respect me.

                                   HELEN
                         But how can you respect yourself if
                         you don't?

               INT. NELSON LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Ted's parents and Jimmy walk through the front door. They're
               stunned to find a huge 24x36 enlarged family portrait,
               hanging over the mantle. It's the same picture Ted broke in
               his childish tantrum. Mom and Dad are moved. Even more so
               when they see Ted. Waiting for them on the couch.  Ted rises. 
               Misty eyed.

                                   TED
                         Everything I am is because of you.
                         Can you ever forgive me?

                                   MOM
                             (hugging him)
                         Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.

                                   DAD
                         You were always our number one son.

                                   JIMMY
                             (rolling his eyes)
                         Mom, Dad. This display of
                         unconditional love is appalling.

                                   MOM
                         We are a FAMILY.

                                   JIMMY
                         A family, need I remind you, that
                         HE ridiculed and left for dead.

                                   TED
                         Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.

                                   DAD
                         I will not have my boys arguing.

                                   JIMMY
                         So, when I'm seventeen, can I turn
                         everyone's life upside-down, behave
                         like a total piece of canine
                         excrement, and then wipe the slate
                         clean with a half-baked apology and
                         a Kodak moment?

                                   MOM & DAD
                         No!

                                   JIMMY
                         Which is precisely why I got the
                         rights to my new room IN WRITING.

                                   TED
                             (to his parents)
                         I need your help.  I'm really in
                         deep shit.

                                   MOM
                         Don't say "shit," honey. Use the
                         strong vocabulary God gave you.

                                   DAD
                         Besides, there's no problem too
                         deep or too shitty for us to solve.

               Dad reaches for a can of peaches from the shelf.

                                   DAD
                         Son, it's a simple fix. The only
                         difference between my store and
                         that magazine of yours is a bunch
                         of zeros. Now, have I ever told you
                         the story about the can of peaches?

               INT. CONFERENCE HALL - DAY

               A "Heaven" stockholders' meeting in progress. Uncle Billy
               stands at the podium.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         Ladies, gentlemen. "Heaven" has
                         gone to hell.

               Behind him are charts, wall graphs. We quickly realize he is
               a complete and utter turn-coat.

                                   UNCLE BILLY (CONT'D)
                         I loved my brother. I stood by his
                         wishes to let his son run the
                         company. A son he never knew. A son
                         that he and his wife gave away at
                         birth. A son who was raised in a
                         world quite different from our own.
                         Nevertheless, I was there for the
                         lad. I guided him as best I could.
                         But he's only seventeen, with a
                         mind of his own and judgment that
                         is, well, frankly, not a chip off
                         the old block. There is only one
                         clear solution...
                             (gesturing to himself)
                         And I think we all know what that
                         is--

                                   TED (O.S.)
                         --PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!

               Ted bursts into the meeting with his Dad. Holding up a can of
               peaches. Suddenly hundreds of eyes are upon him. Curious,
               bewildered. 

               Ted dashes to the podium, with passion in his soul and fire
               in his belly.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         What are you doing?

                                   TED
                         My job. Back off, Benedict.

               Uncle Billy steps into the shadows as Ted looks out at the
               crowd. He's petrified. But he takes a deep breath and finds
               the courage to explain...

                                   TED (CONT'D)
                         The only man I called "Dad" owns a
                         little grocery store in Xenia,
                         Ohio.  He learned a lot of cool
                         stuff from my Grandpa, who was a
                         peach farmer in his day. Grandpa
                         knew the right thing to say in
                         every situation, and it usually
                         involved peaches. My dad's a lot
                         like him. And he taught me, you
                         have to focus on the peachy side of
                         life, not the pits.

               Dad's eyes are filled with tears. He's never been so proud.

                                   TED (CONT'D)
                         There was a time when canned
                         peaches were the hottest, greatest
                         thing ever invented.
                         It was like a little taste of
                         summer, anytime you wanted. Grocery
                         stores couldn't keep them in stock,
                         they were so popular. And even
                         though other canned fruits like
                         pears, plums, and pineapples have
                         come along, people still need to
                         know they can get their canned
                         peaches, on the same shelf,
                         whenever they want them. It's
                         comforting, you know? It fulfills
                         their expectations.

               The stockholders are listening. Uncle Billy grins nervously.
               Unable to believe Ted is pulling this off.

                                   TED (CONT'D)
                         You're probably wondering if
                         there's a point to all this and I
                         guess it's just that I goofed last
                         month. I not only moved the canned
                         peaches, I restocked the shelves
                         with kiwi, guava, and mandarin
                         oranges in heavy syrup. I
                         challenged people's expectations. 
                         And you can't do that to your
                         customers. So, I ask you for one
                         more chance to fix things and give
                         our readers back their canned
                         peaches.

               The stockholders APPLAUD enthusiastically, giving Ted a
               standing ovation. Ted turns to Uncle Billy.

                                   TED (CONT'D)
                         Thanks for teaching me an important
                         lesson. What makes a family is
                         love, not blood.

                         That's right. And guess who's the
                         new King of the Unemployment Line.

                                   UNCLE BILLY
                         Aw, come on, kid. Throw me a bone.
                         I'm your uncle for gosh sakes.

               INT. "HEAVEN" HEADQUARTERS - DAY

               MONTAGE

               Ted looks at pictures. Layouts. Reads copy. Listens to his
               staff. He seems confident. In control. Mature beyond his
               years. The magazine goes to press. In VOICE OVER, we hear
               Julie, reading the article about Ted that she wrote for the
               school paper.

                                   JULIE (V.O.)
                         "It's easy to fall prey to petty
                         jealousy when considering the young
                         life of Ted Nelson. But how would
                         any of us behave if one day all our
                         dreams came true? Would we handle
                         it half as well? Would we find
                         ourselves making the same mistakes
                         for which we criticize him?"

               Someone hands Ted a copy of Julie's article. He reads the
               last portion of it aloud...

                                   TED
                         "One can only hope that Ted Nelson
                         will find bigger and better dreams
                         upon which to set his sights as the
                         years pass. And that he will
                         remember, always, where he came
                         from."

               EXT. JULIE'S HOUSE - DAY

               Julie opens her front door. Charlie grins. He hands her a
               copy of "Heaven."

                                   CHARLIE
                         Page three.

               Intrigued, she turns to the page.

               CLOSE ON MAGAZINE

               We see a special dedication, "To Julie, My Partner in Crime,
               With All the Love in the World." Julie's eyes fill with
               tears. She flips ahead to "The Girls of Xenia" pictorial,
               only to find--

               Principal Merkin. Singing his heart out, in drag as Barbra
               Streisand. It's a series of shots from the Cincinnati
               nightclub. Other shots suggestively include him with Molly in
               the foreground, as if they posed together.

                                   JULIE
                         Not bad for a hack. He has a future
                         in yellow journalism.

                                   CHARLIE
                         He kicked major ass and you know
                         it.

               INT. MERKIN'S HONDA CIVIC - MOVING - DAY

               Principal Merkin drives. The RADIO plays in the b.g. As one
               song ends, we hear the DJ say...

                                   DJ
                         This one's for you Dick Merkin of
                         Tecumseh High. From all your
                         students. With hugs and kisses.

               The voice of Barbra Streisand fills the car.

                                   BARBRA STREISAND (ON THE RADIO)
                         "People/People who need People/Are
                         the luckiest people in the world."

               Principal Merkin pales.  He turns off the radio.  But
               somehow, he can still hear the song.  As he pulls into the
               school parking lot, students wave enthusiastically.  He waves
               back tentatively.  Anxiety rising.

               EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

               Principal Merkin swings open his car door to be greeted by
               the sound of Barbra singing her heart out through the parking
               lot. Every student's car stereo blasts the song. Students
               CHEER. Chanting:  "BAR-BRA, BAR-BRA, BAR-BRA!"  Principal
               Merkin turns crimson.

               EXT. SCHOOL STADIUM - DAY

               Graduation caps fall all around. People hugging, laughing,
               overjoyed. Ted searches for Julie, but she's nowhere in
               sight.

               INT./EXT. NELSON'S HOUSE - EVENING

               A big graduation party in progress. But Ted sits in the
               corner, looking sad, dejected. Julie didn't show up. He blew
               it. Jimmy and Charlie approach, with cheering on their minds.

                                   JIMMY
                         Why so melancholy?

                                   CHARLIE
                         You were born naked, wet, and
                         hungry. Now you're hip, handsome,
                         and rich. You are the coxswain on
                         the ship of life.

                                   JIMMY
                         Eat, Drink, and Screw Mary!

                                   CHARLIE
                             (proudly)
                         I taught him that.

                                   TED
                         Great.

                                   JIMMY
                         From my wise, albeit youthful,
                         vantage point, the world is your
                         oyster. You scored big.

                                   CHARLIE
                         You got everything you ever wanted.

                                   TED
                         Except the girl. The only one that
                         really mattered.

                                   JULIE (O.S.)
                         And who might that be?  Miss July?
                         Miss August?

               Ted turns to find Julie. His faces brightens with hope.

                                   TED
                         Julie, wow. I was afraid you left.
                         I was afraid I'd never see you
                         again.

                                   JULIE
                         I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're
                         the one with the champagne wishes
                         and caviar dreams. 

                                   TED
                         I decided to let Helen run the
                         magazine. I need to go to college,
                         learn a few things, you know.

               Julie seems pleased.

                                   TED (CONT'D)
                         And I thought maybe I'd take up
                         boating. I've always wanted to be a
                         "coxswain."

                                   JULIE
                         Very ambitious. I like that.

                                   TED
                         The thing is, I'll need a first
                         mate.

                                   JULIE
                         I know where you can find any
                         number of naked girls who'd love to
                         hop on board.

               All kidding aside, he speaks from the heart...

                                   TED
                         Julie, you were right. All the
                         naked girls in the world mean
                         nothing.
                         It's the one you want to cover up
                         with your coat that you really
                         love.

               Julie smiles...

                         I graduated from college. Did
                         great, summa cum laude and all. And
                         I'm about to launch a brand new
                         magazine called "EXPOSED!"  An
                         homage to Miss Julie Conroy of
                         Xenia, Ohio.

               Julie grins.

                                   JULIE
                         I know where you can find an
                         excellent editor-in-chief.

                                   TED

                         Let your fingers do the walking.

               Suddenly the music changes. "People." Ted grins.

                             (taking his hand)
                         You better.

               Ted and Julie begin dancing and kissing in the b.g.   

               Charlie and Jimmy feign tears.

                                   CHARLIE
                         I'm a sucker for a happy ending.
                             (hugging Jimmy)
                         Hold me.

               And we start to RISE AGAIN, above the NELSON HOUSE, into the
               clouds above Xenia...

                         So, as you can guess, everybody
                         pretty much lived happily ever
                         after. My parents didn't give up
                         the grocery store...

               We descend through clouds and quickly find we're...

               EXT. LONDON - BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY

               Mom and Dad take pictures and smooch in front of the palace.

                                   TED (V.O.)
                         ...but they did manage to sneak
                         away for a second honeymoon.

               ON A NEARBY NEWSSTAND

               We ZOOM CLOSE on "Heaven Magazine," where pages flip open in
               the wind, revealing...

               PRINCIPAL MERKIN "EXPOSED" IN THE PAGES OF "HEAVEN."

                                   TED (V.O.)
                         Merk's appearance in "Heaven"
                         turned out to be a good thing. He
                         was spotted by a talent scout... 

               INT. LONDON DRAG CLUB - NIGHT

               Principal Merkin dressed as Barbra, singing "Don't Rain on My
               Parade."

                         ...and went on a European summer
                         tour, fulfilling his lifelong
                         dream. Naturally he brought
                         Poochie, the only girl he ever
                         really loved.  

               IN THE WINGS

               Poochie, the Cocker Spaniel, watches. Wagging her tail.

                         After graduation, Charlie moved to
                         Utah...

               STILL PHOTOGRAPHS OF...

               EXT. UTAH FARM - DAY

               Charlie wrestling in a haystack with the IDENTICAL TAYLOR
               TRIPLETS.

                                   TED (V.O.)
                         ...where he married all three of
                         the identical Taylor Triplets.
                         Let's just say, they've been very
                         busy...

               Peeking out of the haystack, we spot at least a dozen CHARLIE
               JR's.

                         And even Uncle Billy landed on his
                         feet.

               INT. TELEMARKETING CUBICLE - DAY

               Uncle Billy wears a phone headset. He seems to be swimming in
               a sea of "Time-Life" style operators.

                                   BILLY
                         ...with a two year subscription to

                         And now if you'll excuse me, I
                         think I'll get back to being the
                         coxswain on the ship of life.

               EXT. SAILBOAT - PACIFIC COAST - DAY

               Ted and Julie sail off into, what else but a GLORIOUS SUNSET.
